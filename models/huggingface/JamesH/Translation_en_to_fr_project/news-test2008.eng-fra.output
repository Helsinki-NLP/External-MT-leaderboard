Food: Where European inflation slipped up
The skyward zoom in food prices is the main force behind the speedup in eurozone inflation.
October and November inflation rates were higher than expected in 13 eurozone countries, with October's 2.6 percent yr/yr inflation rate followed by 3.1 percent in November, the EU's Luxembourg-based statistical office reported.
Official forecasts predicted only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
The European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut interest rates, arguing that a rate drop combined with rising raw material prices and declining unemployment would trigger an inflationary spiral.
The ECB wants to keep inflation under two percent or somewhere in that vicinity.
According to one analyst, ECB is in a Catch-22: It must talk down inflation to keep from having to take action to push it down later in the game.
Germany’s November inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record; in Spain the rate rose to 4.1 percent from an earlier 3.6.
Food and energy prices soared into the stratosphere.
Wheat futures were up by 88 percent and soybean prices were at their highest since 1973.
Consumers also have to pay significantly more for vegetable oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil rose by 52 percent this year, with black gold costing nearly 100 dollars a barrel last month.
The ECB predicts that 2008 inflation will climb to 2.5 percent from the previous 2.1, but will drop back to 1.9 percent in 2009.
Analysts see the 12-month inflation rate steadily rising at about 3 percent over the next 3-4 months, but estimate that the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
The ECB also predicts that it will cut interest rates two times during 2008.
Government crisis coming, says Gallup
Early December, Fidesz support soared significantly after a long period of holding its own, while Gallup reports support for the socialists at an all-time low of 13 percent.
The overall party preference is almost two-thirds of the overall vote, while MSZP has only one-third of the vote.
The poll shows MDF and SZDSZ numbers below the threshold needed to get into parliament, getting about 2 percent support each in the whole sample.
Among people with clear party preferences who say they definitely would vote, support for these two parties is 3 percent each.
The public mood about the economy has fallen even lower than the last measured. The proportion of people who believe the country is in the pit is an unprecedented 41 percent, and another 46 percent just think it is in good shape.
After higher hopes in spring and summer, people are again more scepticical about their family’s future.
The public expects things to get worse and only one in ten predicts improvement.
In Gallup December poll, more than ever before - 71 percent - said the Prime Minister was doing poorly than goodly.
The sample said it trusted or highly trusted Ferenc Gyurcsány, while 38 percent believed in Viktor Orbán.
54% of the respondents believed the PM was not trusting, while 27 percent said they mistreated the Fidesz chairman.
One gauge of the political situation is the proportion of people who believe that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be managed without having to form a new government.
After last October's rioting, 35 percent of the public thought it would be best to keep the government and PM in office. Following the rioting, the public believed that new elections should be held.
When asked about interest in a referendum, 60 percent of the sample said it would definitely vote in one, while another 20 percent said it most likely would go to the polls.
In contrast, only 55 percent of respondents would definitely vote in parliamentary elections if they were to be held this Sunday, while another 15 percent would most likely vote.
74 percent of people want to repeal tuition fees, 79 percent to scrap co-payments for doctor visits and 84 percent want to end per diem hospital charges.
Looking only at the ratios of people who voted for the referendum, we find that 81 percent are against tuition fees, 84 percent are against doctor co-payments and 89 percent are against hospital per diems.
Auchan prices are the highest, Tesco's are up by almost 20 percent.
The giant supermarkets located in the Budaörs shopping triangle have averaged 16 percent increases for the second year in a row, but they do not have to deal with a VAT increase that they did last year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
Prices In Napi's usual Christmas basket were up by an average of 16 percent this year in the Budaörs shopping triangle, with each supermarket increasing prices by over a thousand forints.
After supermarket prices went through the roof last December, the increases looked less dramatic percentagewise than the high base.
The shock to consumers is that they need over ten thousand forints to buy the same products they could get for under nine thousand a year ago.
Napi's basket exceeded the psychological HUF 10,000 limit by a minimum of HUF 91 at the giant supermarkets tested.
The most expensive basket costs us 10 573 forints.
(in 2003, the same basket reached 6,800 forints).
The price of Unicum and live fish remained at roughly last year's level, but boneless turkey breast, walnuts, and poppy seeds were up significantly.
The price of flour and bread was mostly in line with official Statistics Office data, but we found bread for 139 forints a kilogram at Auchan.
The competition factor was not enough to push the product's price down to under 200 forints.
Another surprise in this store was that it charged less than 200 forints for a two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola in a bottle with deposit on it, so the full price was still 257 forints.
However, this year Napi's basket costs the most at Auchan and the least at Cora.
The numbers were analyzed and found that Napi's basket costs 15 percent more than last Christmas at Cora, while it was 18 percent more expensive at Tesco and Auchan.
The difference between last year's most expensive and this year's most expensive one was 12 percent, while the gap between last year's most expensive and this year's most expensive one was 21 percent.
In forints, the average increase was 1,480.
The average increase in the last year was 1,206 forints, which included the effects of a VAT hike.
The fact that confused the commerce sector was that the supermarkets were unable to decide on the size of the gap to apply to specific products, making it impossible to calculate the effect of price increases on consumption.
(If the outlet mistakenly calculates the turnover velocity of a product, it stands to lose major profits with a price gap adjusted to turnover intensity.)
The price increase in Napi's basket went up to such extremes that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints over the 2006 level, while the cheapest was only 844 forints more expensive.
This year, no such extremes occurred, with the most expensive basket being 1,630 forints up from last year and the cheapest was 1,284 forints higher.
The comparison of two Christmas seasons revealed a disastrous increase in prices. In less than 20 months, day-to-day consumer goods soared by over 30 percent in the giant supermarkets.
However, this is not quite in line with official Statistics Office data: its figures show a huge increase in price of basic foodstuffs in just 12 months.
includes both flour and egg.)
Napi's basket suggested that this latter was nearly impossible, since the price was up by a shade over 10% on last year's high base price, even where it was most expensive.
The evidence shows that flour suppliers are in a better position than egg producers, as they have managed to force their dramatic price increases on the multinationals.
The supermarkets in the golden shopping triangle were not complaining. All regularly reported that they were having a good year.
The most shoppers in the three outlets we visited were not really interested in prices.
The typical patterns of bulk shopping were to be a means of buying durable foodstuff by the pallet.
On Wednesday morning long queues were seen at all cash registers following a sudden increase in shoppers.
However, to our knowledge, turnover is lower in rural areas.
Many hospitals try to save by reducing disinfectant use.
Hospitals have registered over a thousand cases of infections caused mainly by inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hospital cleanliness, overcrowding, and overburdened staff are not conducive to preventing infection, said the Division Head at the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Many places even try to cut back on disinfectant use to save money.
MRSA - antibiotic resistant staphylococcus - infection was recently diagnosed in the traumatology ward of János hospital.
The infection was detected in a man who was hospitalized after a major accident.
The patient was isolated.
The same hospital had to deal with similar infection early this year.
The hospital discharged a patient after a serious traffic accident, and shortly after, it re-admit the patient because of MRSA infection, and doctors have been unable to perform surgery that would be vital to full recovery because they have been unable to perform surgery that would be vital to full recovery.
This year, up to 10th December, hospitals have reported 1,094 cases of antibiotic-resistant pathogens to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, according to National Centre for Epidemiology physician Karolina Böröcz.
This tells us the number of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that hospitals actually included in their records, but nothing more.
About twothirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSAs, which is officially a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One third of all people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without causing any infection.
The infections that SA cause (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, minor skin infections, and wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated.
However, if antibiotics are overused or inappropriately used, the bacteria that originally respond well to antibiotics can evolve into an antibiotic-resistant variety, which rapidly spreads in hospitals if hygienic conditions are low.
Particularly at risk are elderly and low-body-weight patients whose immune systems have been temporarily or permanently compromised. In these patients, the staph can cause serious nosocomial infections such as wound infections or sepsis.
According to János Hospital's medical director, there is nothing unusual about having an MRSA infection since they are part of everyday hospital life.
The infection is not a disease, Tibor Nyulasi says. MRSA will be found everywhere anyone goes to test for it, he adds.
Antibiotic resistance
Nurse staff wear rubber gloves and masks when working with infected patients.
When a patient is admitted to the hospital, one of the first things done is to check for MRSA, but hospitals are still vulnerable to infection.
Staph testing is not fashionable
The vast majority of nosocomial MRSA-induced infections can be prevented, but current hospital conditions are not conducive to preventing the evolvement and spread of antibiotic-resistant infections.
Since this type of infection typically occurs in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should routinely check all newly admitted patients and immediately isolate MRSA carriers.
However, taking microbiological samples from patients is not common in Hungary.
The reason is that the National Health Insurance Fund does not cover the cost of these tests.
In most cases the bacteria remain unnoticeable unless the patient has a clear MRSA infection, said the National Centre for Epidemiology physician.
The European Union has stringent protocols on the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine and Hungary has its own guidelines on treating various infections and pathologies.
The goal should be targeted therapy, meaning that microbiology tests should be conducted to prevent resistance from evolving, but hospitals do not always follow this.
It is even rarer to take a microbiology sample among outpatients in primary or specialized care, Böröcz added.
Save money by reducing antibiotics
Scientific evidence shows that most common way MRSA is transmitted from one patient to another through healthcare personnel who transport it from patient to patient.
Accordingly, washing hands, and wearing gloves and masks play a significant role in prevention, but again, there are many shortcomings in hospital practice.
MRSAs are transmitted through physical contact and body fluids. Under domestic hospital conditions, an infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In fact, hospital wards are often overcrowded, with beds too close to one another, but they should be at least 1.5 metres apart to conform to epidemiological requirements.
However, we also find that when hospitals are short on money they tend to save on disinfectants, adding that with a shortage of nursing staff and too many patients, infection increases.
According to Böröcz, there are demonstrably less infections and those that occur are easier to prevent from spreading, in hospitals that take appropriate protective measures.
Government programme to combat MRSA
MRSA infections cost the health insurance a huge amount of money, so efforts should be made to prevent them from occurring in the first place.
In the UK, the government has a programme to reduce MRSA and prevent its spread.
The programme seems to be successful as published data shows that MRSA is declining in the UK.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has set out the prevention of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and nosocomial infections as a priority project.
Police chief causing fatal accident was not drinking.
The official professional opinion has been submitted regarding a fatal accident caused by Budapest's District 22 police chief.
Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Budapest Municipal Prosecutor's Office, issued a statement on Friday, on receipt of the professional opinion.
Professional opinion supports the result of the preliminary investigation, which concluded that the former police chief had not consumed alcohol before getting on the road.
The former District 22 police chief was driving his own car in his district. He turned around a corner and hit a 55 year old man trying to cross Kossuth Lajos Street at a spot where no marked pedestrian crossing was visible.
The absence of an official crossing point is not a mitigating circumstance, since traffic rules require that drivers have the right to cross over a turning vehicle.
The pedestrian died shortly after arrival at a hospital.
The district police chief resigned after the accident and requested that he resign from the force because he was so shocked by the event.
The Budapest Prosecutor's Investigative Unit is conducting an investigation.
The former police chief has been cooperating with the prosecutors in the case, Morvai added.
Additional 400 million euros available for infrastructure
The amount of 100 million euros in loans will be available for education, transport, environmental infrastructure and energy development after three agreements signed by Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice President Marta Gajecka in Budapest on Friday.
EIB approved a 300 million euros framework package in 2006 to help the Hungarian budget finance transport and environmental projects implemented by the cohesion fund. A concrete contract for 100 million from the package was signed in 2006, so one new contract covers the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The second agreement, for 150 million euros, will help the budget finance education-related projects.
EIB has already approved a 300 million Euro package for Hungary to use for upgrades to these areas. The extra 150 million euros can be used later, when the credit agreement is extended.
The third agreement was for 50 million euros for innovation. The central budget plans to use it mainly in a R&D project at Debrecen University.
The talks included a new metro line under construction in Budapest.
The agreement was that when Hungary finalizes metro financing details with the EU, they would revisit the original contract to see if they needed to be changed, and if so, how.
However, he believed that the latter discussion would take place in the first quarter of 2008.
EIB has provided Hungary with the equivalent of 8.4 billion euros since 1990, which was used to finance 113 projects.
EIB is linking interest rates on the loans to EURIBOR, allowing an 8 year grace period, and is charging no commission to maintain fund availability.
Bulgaria: The EU's real estate paradises
The real estate market in Bulgaria has been growing at an unbelievable rate - Europe has its eyes on this once-rare Balkan nation.
What is buying and where on this market, which is still the cheapest in the EU despite rapidly rising prices?
This analysis is from RE/MAX Bulgarian division.
No question but that Bulgaria is the most sought-after East European real estate target, with its low-cost ski chalets and oceanfront homes.
The most fashionable mountain sites are Bansko, Borovets and Vitosha, while on the seaside the most popular areas are Albena, the Golden Sands and ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but a growing number of investors are looking at real estate around Karvarna and Balcsik.
According to RE/MAX Bulgaria analysts, soon or later the central part of the country will start attracting investors.
Sofia, the capital, also has many attractive opportunities. Commercial and office space offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on the way to be one of Europe's most exciting golf destinations.
Forward-thinking investors are already making major purchases, for example, in and around Bansko.
Analysts suggest that people who buy real estate in Bulgaria would also like to change their lifestyles.
Most investors are from the UK, but many also come from France, Belgium, and Spain, with a growing number coming from Romania.
Maltees and Cypriot investors have also gained foothold, while Russians are traditional big time buyers at the Black Sea and on top ski slopes.
There are three types of international buyers, said Regional Manager of RE/MAX Bulgaria Georgi Yankov.
The ones who plan to resettle in Bulgaria either purchase renovated properties for 50,000-100,000, or old fixer-uppers for 5,000-15,000 and then renovate them themselves.
Their purchases should be easy to access and equipped for modern communication.
Next group of buyers is interested in summer homes (Bulgaria joined Germany's top ten holiday destinations in December).
The fourth group includes investors for business purposes, who are counting on medium or long-term appreciation.
The prices in Sofia, the capital, are steadily rising, as is demand.
While Bulgaria boasts the European Union's lowest real estate prices, they have continued to rise by 21 percent in the past five years.
Actually, the rise in real estate prices has exceeded the growth in salaries.
EnviMin and Hungary's six percent estimated GDP
Climate Minister Gábor Fodor has announced that professional level meetings on post-2012 international climate issues will end on Tuesday. The conference will officially open on Wednesday, when the ministers take up the matter.
Political and policy makers from 192 countries are expected to discuss the Bali Roadmap, which focuses on efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions after the Kyoto Protocol expires.
In current developing and developed countries are in a heated dispute.
The United States has made it clear that it is unwilling to agree to precise numbers but it is not opposed to a 25-40 percent cut in greenhouse gases by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question at the conference is whether the developed countries are ready to reduce their emissions but also to offer financial and technological assistance to countries that need it.
One agreement was on support to developing countries.
The 16-member board will manage the funding for this, which is set by the Kyoto Protocol, and will most likely work in the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF).
Hungary’s six percent increase
Representative of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor is ready to support EU efforts to maintain its flagship role in global climate protection effort and promote a new international agreement, to be signed by 2009.
According to Fodor, the EU is ready to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990, if the "post-2012 agreement" is reached or not, and is ready to cut them by 30 percent if other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also ready to accept obligations to the extent of their abilities and responsibilities.
Fodor added that in 1997, the countries adhering to the Kyoto Protocol had targeted a 5.2 percent reduction in overall emissions. In that group, the 15-member EU agreed to an 8 percent decline.
Hungarian government agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-1987, a goal it is aiming at, according to the Environment ministry's press release.
The stakes in Bali are high, for a long-term international climate policy agreement must be under wraps within two years or it will not be implemented by 2012.
The result could be a delay in emissions reduction, which would place Earth on a course towards an average temperature rise exceeding 2 degrees Celsius.
UK uses YouTube as military recruiting tool
British military units have been sharing their Iraqi and Afghanistani actions through video clips on You Tube in an effort to popularize their mission.
The Royal Air Force (RAF) was the first to develop a taste for YouTube: its special forces in Afghanistan have been uploading video clips showing how they have been combating the Taliban since March 2006, BBC reports.
The images, taken with miniature cameras attached to troop helmets, are monitored by a command centre in Kandahar and then sent to London from where they are uploaded on the Internet.
There is no mistaking the political message.
Fully 139 RAF images have been uploaded to the Internet and so far they have received over 75,000 hits.
The UK defence ministry has been registered as "defence headquarters" and regularly uploading video clips on Iraqi and Afghanistani actions, while the Commonwealth Office and the Multinational Force - Iraq (MNF-I) have their own You Tube channels.
Introduction Afghanistan
The RAF originally uploaded the videos as a recruiting tool, and the defence ministry says they have also been a good way to let the public know the real purpose of the RAF.
Advertising through this route costs almost nothing compared to traditional recruitment commercials on television, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told BBC.
Americans have turned it into a game.
The problem the military has to deal with is the amateur videos being shared alongside the carefully edited and censured official clips, sometimes even showing dying soldiers.
The video clips from the Iraqi and Afghanistani battlefields have been posted on the Internet, but British forces have only recently joined the postings.
American recruiting is a bit different. The US has been using America's Army, a tactical shooting game available for free download, as a recruiting tool.
Raffle tickets and savoury scones dominate ministry Christmas party
Employment Minister Mónika Lamperth is holding an end-year staff conference instead of a Christmas party, but coffee and savoury scones will be served.
Other ministries plan parties with live bands, while some are giving out raffle tickets and a glass of Christmas spirit to enhance the mood and find a way into the staff’s heart.
Celebrations, Christmas spirit, concerts and smorgasbord - how the powerful party.
Government offices also get ready for Christmas.
The Defence ministry is planning the biggest ministry Christmas party, but the guests will not be ministry staff.
It will have gifts for the children of soldiers who have died while serving, it's Mission Christmas will host families of soldiers currently serving in international missions, and its press reception will be for the media.
The ministry plans to spend 25 million for year-end mood improvement.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) are getting up their feet and partying more aggressively than other government offices.
GKM is holding its party at the Future House, and spending HUF 4,320,000 on the package for about 350 of its 600 staff.
The event is focused on creating a true Christmas atmosphere, and will include live performers and a raffle with prizes.
NFÜ spends 4,700,000 forints on its Christmas cheer, holding its celebration at the headquarters of the National Justice Administration Council (OIT). It will host a series of concert performances and dinner.
The hall rental cost one million forints, and the rest went on the more than four hundred invited guests.
The NFÜ has been told that one division of NFÜ has been invited to another Christmas party, which will be held with EU money.
It rented out the entire Vígszínház theatre for the event.
MAG Zrt did not confirm this as we could not find any responsible person.
Informal dress is fine.
OIT headquarters hosted not only NFÜ but also the Justice and Law Enforcement Ministry, which decided to hold a Lucia Day ball on December 7 instead of a Christmas party.
OIT did not charge this group for use of its building.
About 500 people attended the ball.
The party started with a toast by the minister, and after the dinner there was dancing to live music.
When asked by origo they said that formal dress was not mandatory for women or men.
Health, labor and local government organized more puritan dances.
Health ministry held a celebration for its staff at its own headquarters, spending 400,000 forints on the event.
The Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth called it a Christmas party, but a year-end staff conference.
The ministry expects 180 guests, which will be offered only coffee and savoury scones to stay within a budget of HUF 350.000.
Local Government Minister Gordon Bajnai plans to drink a simple toast with staff in the assembly hall of the Ministry for Local Government and Regional Development.
The finance ministry (FM) is holding a Christmas gathering in its own assembly hall and has invited 436 staff members.
The party will include a smothersbord buffet and one toast per person.
Parliament workers have always welcomed Christmas in this fashion since János Veres became minister.
People do not plan to party - the mood will remain official thanks to the minister who plans to make a speech, and partly to the time - it will be in the afternoon.
The farm ministry is holding off for a New Year's reception, which will be on January 20, so there will not be any Christmas celebration.
The reception will be held in a Vajdahunyad castle in the City Park, and the ministry reported that it plans to spend 1,000 forints per guest, for 100 guests.
The media department underlined that it was offering a very simple buffet meal, to which it was inviting only the professional diplomats accredited to Hungary.
The reception, a re-occurring one held every year for some time now, will start with a brief greeting from the minister and end with a bit of snacking.
The foreign and education ministries do not plan to hold any Christmas parties, the media departments told Origo.
Environment ministry was unable to tell us the cost of its office Christmas.
The museum has invited over 400 guests to a party it plans to hold at the Museum of Applied Arts.
Massive strike forces come together
On Friday, the Liga Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Councils (NWF) will form a strike committee to coordinate an open-ended strike which starts on Monday.
The group plans to hold a protest rally on Saturday and on Monday - the day parliament will vote on a health insurance bill - they will start their work stoppage.
The strike is certain to damage the transport network, as trains will become more or less completely stopped and Budapest public transport will be blocked until 1.00 p.m.
Working Council federation will publish details of their jointly organized Monday walkout on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is being set up to coordinate Monday’s industrial action.
Organizers plan to hold a public protest demonstration on Saturday, and the organizations joining the strike will begin an open-ended work stoppage on Monday unless they can reach a prior agreement with the government.
What this means is that they have not set a termination date for the walkout, starting from the day parliament adopts the health insurance bill.
If parliament fails to adopt the health insurance law, the unions will immediately retract their strike appeal.
If they adopt the bill, the strike committees will meet and decide on their next move.
Given the parliament's agenda for Monday, it is possible that the health insurance bill may not come up for a vote until evening or possibly late at night.
The strike that starts on Monday is expected to cause significant delays in the transport system. The railways will stop running for an open-ended period, while a portion of Budapest public transport may be halted through noon, as well as half of the long distance bus lines.
The same time, partial roadblocks on many of the nation's highways will be added.
Many unions and civic organizations have responded to the strike appeal. A complete and regularly updated list of them is available on Liga's website.
Some organizations have announced open-ended strikes, while others are restricting themselves to temporary work stoppages.
The agreement was not reached between MÁV and the Railway Workers' Free Trade Union (VDSZSZ), despite the fact that a growing number of people plan to travel by rail as the Christmas holidays approach.
The Budapest Transport Company will be out from start work to 1 p.m., Budapest Airport will halt work from 7 to 9 a.m., Liga's Power and Thermal Energy Unions will walk off the job for 4 hours, while the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Union of Teachers will hold 2-hour walkouts.
The National Federation of Physicians will hold a nationwide strike over staggered hours, while the Democratic Union of Health and Welfare Workers (EDDSZ) is planning a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands is that the government repeal its health insurance reform bill and submit a new concept for public debate.
The second demand is that the new method for calculating pensions due to begin next year be introduced gradually, instead of all at once.
The fourth is that when determining the occupations eligible for early retirement, the jobs to be included in the option be selected before 2010.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Railway Workers' Free Trade Union (VRSZSZ), a Liga union, rejected the offer submitted by the Economic and Transport Ministry on spur lines and wants to make a new offer.
Political Capital: The Hungary Guard has heightened the country's risk level.
Hungarian Guard action, established in August with support from the Movement for a Righter Hungary, has raised the political risk level of Hungary and the whole region from several aspects, according to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital.
The research entity issued a "risk warning" writing: the actions of the Hungarian Guard are threatening the existing ethnic tensions between Gypsy and non-Gypsy residents of Hungary, which could become very toxic in the short term, leading to ethnic conflicts that could turn violent.
The main reason for this is that Hungary Guard's political strategy seems to be aimed at provoking such action, the research institutes added.
This is the result of one of Hungary's most serious failures: "The main actors in public life turned the public debate of Roma issues to radical and extremist political forces, who have built a political strategy out of Gypsy-Hungarian differences."
This, Political Capital believes, has intensified the problem, making normal dialogue impossible, reinforcing the extremists, and heightening the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, the research institutes believe that the intensive domestic and international media attention to Hungarian Guard actions has "significantly damaged Hungary's international image, particularly regarding belief in the country's stability and sophistication of its democracy."
The authors point out that the increasing publicity and political fuel to the re-organization of radical and far right groups in Hungary starting in the autumn of 2006 have been part of the reason why several national self-defense alliances were established in the summer of 2007.
These groups are known as civic organizations, but openly declare that they are preparing their members for defensive - including armed - tasks (e.g. disaster management, national defence, law enforcement) while declaring that they are unfit for the role.
All these moves have been made in a configuration that relies on society's anti-politics and anti-political-party mood to hide various political ambitions under a political veil.
In other words, their focus on the civic nature of their actions and their choice of the association as their organizational form are not merely ruse to sidestep legal pitfalls to registration with the courts, but also part of a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is heightening the risk of damage to our relations with our neighbors.
Recent months several of Hungary's neighbors have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential threat. The ultranationalist political players among some of these neighbors have referred to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard as an argument to justify their own anti-Hungarian policies.
All of these factors influence the political stability of the region, it adds.
The research institutes note that the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, and as such it heightens the political risk for the region.
It notes that the operation of the Hungary Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, established in August 2007 by the far right Bulgarian National Union. (BNU).
The serious fighting between Roma and non-Roma in a Sofia district (Krasna Polyana) was the cause of the Bulgarian guard.
BNU used the disturbances to build its guard, claiming that its goal was "national self-defense."
They argue that for the past 17 years Bulgaria has been subject to "Gypsy terror," in which the government was unable to act and remained indifferent, Political Capital reported.
The initiative caused heated debate in Bulgarian public, it added.
The signs of ethnic conflict have become more serious, the analysts wrote.
Since the Hungarian Guard has so far acted quite similarly to the Bulgarian National Guard, it is possible that the Roma community of Hungary could respond to the threat by organizing their own self-defense, which is quite possible, according to Political Capital.
Political Capital research manager Attila Juhász answered to a question from the MTI Hungarian wire service by saying risk analysis was one of the research institutes' main activities.
Each year, he said, they publish risk analyses, and if they discover any factor that might alter risks, they advise public opinion by publishing a risk warning, as they have now done.
Holidays: Not everyone gets to enjoy the red letter days.
Hungarian law names red letter days specifically, and reorganizing working days to increase the number of days off around the holidays has become a general practice, but next year we will not see much reorganization.
Holidays are not uniform in EU or USA either.
The Hungary legal system distinguishes between national holidays, state/bank holidays and non-working days.
Non-working days are mostly religious holidays and anniversary of significant historical events.
Hungarian New Year's Eve and Day are both non-working days - the first if no other reason than to recover from New Year's Eve festivities.
There are totally eleven red-letter days in each calendar year.
March 15 is a national holiday commemorating the revolution of 1848 and October 23 commemorates the 1956 revolution.
July 20 marks the founding of the country, and May Day is Labour Day.
In addition, Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas are each two-day holidays.
Since our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend, it has become common to reorganize the working week when there is only one workday between the holiday and the weekend.
The long weekend has a price, which is to have to spend the preceding or succeeding Saturday at work or school.
The Minister of Labour has issued decrees on the days we have to work to get extra day off between the holiday and weekend.
The decree covers all employers and all workers they employ, including civil servants and public employees.
It does not cover staff in facilities, businesses or institutions that regularly operate round-the-clock or where staff work 24/7.
The last change this year will be around the end of the year holidays, as we have learned that most people find ways to take off the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, either by saving vacation days or by working longer hours before and after the holidays and taking a longer vacation time.
Next year most holidays will occur in midweek, so less manipulation of the calendar than this year.
The first re-organization of the working week will occur to accommodate May Day and allow working people to have four consecutive days off.
Saturday April 26 will be a workday, and in exchange, Friday, May 2 will be a day off.
The working week will be re-started around the October 23 holiday. Saturday, October 18 will be a workday so people may have Friday, October 24 off.
The end of the year will be wall-to-wall holidays, with most people enjoying time off from December 24 through New Year's Eve, even though New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six little things you can annoy your colleagues with
The emails we forget to send, the voice-mail messages we never get, the white lies we tell and no longer notice - all can colour our work life.
The question is whether you get used to the minor annoyances or pick up the gauntlet and deliberately avoid dubious situations that can irritate others.
A few tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that marketing was looking for you," says one of your colleagues.
You missed a meeting because of that?
In a best case scenario, he or she will apologize and try to mend things.
In most cases the matter ends with an apology.
Before you get into a situation where you have to apologize, consider what you might do to give your colleagues a few unpleasant minutes, and then deliberately try to avoid doing them.
Do you steal things that do not belong to you?
Nothing is more annoying than reaching for a document, piece of office equipment or phone which turns out to not be there.
You remember having left your stapler on your desk but it appears to have wings.
Maybe you see the pen you thought you lost on your colleague's desk.
Please do not take anything away from a colleague's desk without asking. They have every right to be angry if you take off with their belongings.
Do not pocket office envelopes or Post-It notes. It can be very irritating if they run out prematurely, especially if you are the one who needs one immediately.
Do you gossip about your colleagues' private lives?
There is no good way to stop gossip that has already spread.
Who is doing what with whom?
Where and why?
There is no need to spread your information (assumptions) about your colleague all through the house!
If someone shares his or her most intimate secrets with you, do not abuse that trust!
When a colleague is out, do not discuss his or her private life with others, even if they also know what the person has done.
Do you call in sick when you are not?
When you call in sick because of a splitting headache, or when you just feel good, think about the workers who will have to take up the slack and get all your urgent tasks done by deadline.
Do not play dirty with your colleagues!
If you know beforehand that you are not going to be in, or if something causes you to stay home for a day, tell your colleagues and supervisor to know.
Humming, hooting, phoning
How have you ever been totally immersed in your work, only to lose your focus because of gffawing colleagues?
You have ever been unwilling to hear a phone conversation you would have preferred not to hear?
Do not disturb your colleagues by gumming, singing or loud talking (right over their head), tapping rhythms with your feet, continuous cursing or loudly voiced complaints.
All of these things can be irritating, even if people are not concentrating on a project (writing, planning or organizing something).
Do you blame others for your mistakes?
If something is not prepared by deadline, if you forgot to send out an important letter or pass on a message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Do not blame chaos in the office - even if they exist - or your loud colleagues!
Accept that you made the mistake and someone else suffered the consequences, and do what you can to make amends!
Ask how you can repair the damage and do what you need to make things right!
Office too much like a second home?
Track suit and slippers: quite comfortable when you are home, but they are not office wear!
Do not dress for leisure at work, even if your job allows it.
Do not be sloppy. Show respect for your colleagues and yourself by dressing tastefully - and elegantly if your job requires it - to work.
The moment you decide to meet expectations, you become uninteresting.
I am creeping along in the car in the normal morning traffic jam.
The radio starts playing a strange tune: it is a violin sound with special electronic effects.
I give it a bit more volume.
The music changes beat and a base tone joins the other instruments. Then, like a true jewel, a female choir steps in.
I am listening to Zagar's Wings of Love on mr2.
The domestic music world has not spoiled us with high quality electronic pop in a long time.
Then, suddenly you can look at the traffic jam in a new light while listening to the new Zagar CD.
The appearance of Yonderboi and the few new and exciting productions that have popped up from the domestic digital underground are slowly changing the picture.
Balázs Zságer got his start in Pécs and even played in the Yonderboi ensemble for a time. Then, maybe because this town was too small for them - he moved on to do his own thing.
The project (Zagar) and his music, an assortment of jazz, electronic dance music, and pop, started to spread into the public when he suddenly was asked to write soundtracks for films (such as The Avengers).
Ferenc Török's Ferenc Season (Season).
The wider audience started to know his combos, which initially played in smaller clubs, when "wan2" magazine listed his first CD among the top 50 in 2002 and said Zagar was the only member of Yonderboi who was marketable in the west and looked like a domestic trendsetter.
No question about Zagar and his group became "trendy" but no one asked them if they like the label.
The group responded with a new and even better CD.
Their latest, called Cannot Walk Fly Instead, is just out, and it is a very new sight, although in itself the title does not explicitly connect them to their early years in Pécs.
The title is a line used by Balázs Zságer's old Pécs group.
We would be on course with the easygoing reference to flight but for the effects of the louder guitar and the rock and roll beat that joins the soaring tones, a tribute to the times.
György Ligeti, who is a singer in Britain with The Puzzle, made his intro with these tunes when the disc was premiered at the Millenáris.
The CD produced a real radio hit. mr2 Petőfi, which has been playing pop music from morning to evening, started a stealth offensive on our ears with Wings of Love and the soaring sound produced by the six Hungarian women singers ("Underground Divas").
So, everything is okay. Or is it?
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: The question this new hit song raises is how culty your music has remained?
Zságer: I do not see much meaning in the term cult music.
I think there are two light music categories; not mainstream and underground and not alternative and pop, but commerce and honest.
So-called alternative or underground music can be dull and uninspiring and produced for the sole purpose of boosting sales, which places it in the commerce category.
While a good pop song can be inspired by honest motives.
The attitudes of the recipients operate in that spirit, irrespective of language and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the reception of domestic and international audiences as far as your music goes?
B.Zs: Light music has more tradition abroad, especially west of here.
Then, older people also come to concerts, not just teens and twenty-somethings.
The more attention is paid to changes in the genre because they consider it a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Do the people who listen to your music and the number of listening people make a difference?
B.Zs: It is good to see more and more people at our concerts.
But we have never designed our music for the market.
Our music is inspired by inspiration, not a target or goal.
The role of the audience is at the concerts when the effects are contagious, but even that is a result of the intangible changes created by the moment.
I have noticed that when you decide to meet audience expectations you become uninteresting.
hvg.hu: How do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
The soloist has built a career west of where we are.
B.Zs.: We are not following his path even though some people claim to hear him in our music.
We are much stronger team players. We trust one another's musical presence and allow that to grow.
In the beginning there was no way to avoid having our music compared to Yonderboi since several of us split from that group, though we chose a different road.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love took first place on Mr2 Petőfi's hit parade.
Many people first heard the name Zagar with this number.
More popular style was deliberate outreach to a broader audience?
B.Zs.: We never plan to have a hit to boost CD sales.
That song is much more.
The album was designed to wrap the album, trying to lighten the orgy of tone and the harsher themes earlier in the CD.
How did you pick the six women singers?
Why did you pick the voices you did - what was your guiding principle?
B.Zs: The idea was to have a sound like a gospel choir.
The idea was to build the choir with soloists from the domestic music scene who are really good.
The six-voice choir - of Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], and Juci Németh - was named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is the result exactly as you expected it, or did girls play a role in shaping the sound?
B.Zs: It was a very long instrumental version, but then when we were making the CD together, we started to feel that we needed to add something.
The Chordal sequence was asking for a vocal section.
Then I sang the melody onto the instrumental, and that was how the girls learned it afterwards.
The whole thing came to me all at once and it was shockingly spontaneous.
The Divas were necessary to make it work.
It never would have been this powerful in my voice.
hvg.hu: The girls seemed to be secondary on both the disc and at the concert.
There is no solo (except Judy Jay's tiny one), they have no separate role, they sing completely in unison, and they do not outsing the music, so it is not as if they were singing to subordinate musical accompaniment.
On stage, they stood at the back.
What was all that deliberate?
B.Zs.: The reason why they stood at the back of the stage was technical problems.
It was deliberate.
The whole number was about forgetting our egos for a time, not thinking about who came from where and where they are headed, and simply letting them wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
The purpose of the song was to give others the feeling of the enthusiasm we had when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Who gave you the most work?
B.Zs: No really, as far as the process of musical creation was concerned - but some of them gave us a hard time with the arrangement.
Examples are Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play on a concert piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove would not work for a long time - but everything eventually ended up fitting.
hvg.hu: What's your own favourite number on this CD?
B.Zs: It keeps changing with every concert, especially now that I have already left the CD.
At the moment it's Prophet is A Fool, Escape from Earth, and Never the Same.
Saving Broker Ventured Billions due to Inferiority Complex
A foolish embezzler.
This is how the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the local Komerční banka (Commerce Bank) calls his ex-employee Jerome Kerviel.
The company has lost almost five billion Euro.
More likely, it seems that Kerviel was just a big gambler who wanted to match his colleagues, and, quite probably, not an unqualified one.
The crisis in the American mortgage market was recognized by all the big banking houses.
"He is weak," were the words of his superiors, who directed the police to him.
The following testimony is published in French media, e.g. the Le Monde journal, he was a man who earned 1.6 billion Euro from his transactions last year.
A Crisis Not Only in the US.
"All I ever wanted was to gain some money for my bank," he claims in his testimony.
In summer he managed to gain half billion Euro from this American crisis.
The opportunity was found at the beginning of the year.
The news appeared in February that the so-called sub-prime mortgage loans, provided to low-income clients or to those who had problems with them in the past, are going to have problems.
The crisis should not have affected the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe this and he was the right bet.
The end of the year, his profit had reached 1.6 billion Euros.
When I gained the first half billion, I couldn't announce it.
The whole hearing has acknowledged that he forged the records so that he would not be revealed.
The officer managed to deceive his superiors, even though the Eurex Exchange became interested in his affairs.
No venture, no gain.
What was he afraid of?
Rather not.
"I thought that the simple fact of my gaining 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them.
How did he get the will to risk that much?
The position was gradually growing.
The company was established in 2000, immediately after he finished his university studies in Lyon.
The annual income was around $51,000.
Then, two years later, he became an assistant to the broker, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with annual income of $90,000.
Still he knew he would never earn as much as the others.
"As early as I started my first interview in 2005, I knew they despised me.
Because of my education and also for professional and personal development, Kerviel explained the situation to the investigators.
After Kerviel entered his career, the first big success followed.
Allianz shares he gained; during the London bombings he bet half billion Euro that they would fall.
The trigger mechanism was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As Long As You Gain, We Let You Gain.
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
The higher officials are said to have known or rather suspected the whole thing.
"As long as I was earning money for them, they pretended not to see."
Then, at the beginning of the year, a blow came.
In one day he lost 1 billion Euro.
Then he wanted to expunge the whole thing after the weekend in mid January.
The office on Monday was closed.
The bank announced it had lost 5 billion Euro because of him.
How did they uncover him?
Then he became suspicious through his vacations.
"I took only four days out of the last year.
A broker who does not take vacations is a broker who does not want anybody to look into his records.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion.
The Czech Government, together with the European Union, signed nine operational programs, from which the Czech Republic can acquire 14 billion Euro (approximately 365 billion Czech crowns) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total Czech Republic can acquire from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion Czech crowns will be moved from seven operational programs into the regions.
Companies will be able to gain about 100 billion Czech crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation program.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will be directed to transport.
Transportation program is the most important operational program, it represents almost 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transportation Infrastructure, which will be operating a sum of 90.8 billion Czech crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and companies to gain resources for innovation business.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is currently among the least successful in the newly accepted countries.
The 20-year sentence for the ex-President of Nicaragua has been upheld by the court.
The Nicaraguan court of appeals upheld the 20 year sentence for the ex-President of the country, Arnoldo Alemán, in which he was convicted in 2003 for financial fraud of up to $100 million (almost 1.8 billion Czech crowns).
However, he was later liberated and was house arrested in his hacienda, not far from the city.
The former head of this Central American state from 1997-2002 is not yet clear, according to the Associated Press.
The judge of the appeals court, Ileana Péréz, says it will now be dependent on the custodial officials to allow Aléman to serve his sentence home or if he will go to prison.
The court proved four years ago that Aléman regularly shifted government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
The companies were imaginary and the accounts were held by his relatives and close fellows.
The money ended in a fund established to finance his election campaign in 2001.
So They have Approved Our Budget.
It is it.
The state budget has been accepted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget built by this government and accepted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for this year was approved last year with the support of the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), because it was prepared by minister Sobotka and CSSD could not afford it.
In contrast to the animated debate before the no-confidence vote in the government, nothing extreme has occurred this time.
The Chamber of Deputies has passed this traditionally overlooked but most influential law easily.
It is a sort of paradox.
Each governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, like it or not.
The budget is a substantial part of politics, but it is covered by the political fighting between the government and the opposition.
It is more widely appreciated by the media, which is why the media give much more attention to it.
The politicians' disputes are much more interesting for the public than straight numbers.
The past social democratic governments suffered from three diseases that 2008's budget will not resolve all at once:
First, the high proportion of mandatory expenditures, including pensions, but also social benefits passed last year before the election by the silent "alliance" of CSSD and the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM).
Second, there is deficit economy as a result of the first malady.
The third limit is the deficits in public finance, i.e. the budget deficit of cities and villages.
However, the state budget deficit is not the most risk.
It is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb here is the deficit of city and village budgets.
Many mayors, in order to gain resources for their investments other than the money from taxes, fees, and bank loans, often misuse securities, with which they unreasonably incurred debt for the councils.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off the debts by mass sale of stocks of the power and distribution networks they acquired from the state during privatization.
They no longer have this resource.
If we stick to official and certified facts, we discover that:
Our economy has already entered the phase of growth for a few years, as is the rest of the world, about which CSSD keeps talking.
This has been a unique opportunity for its governments to put public finance in order.
Instead they continued to incur debt for the state more and more.
Other countries, including Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed the money much better than our republic.
It is a huge shame, which mainly falls on the previous governments.
We are among the countries which are, measured globally, most at risk of poverty.
Then there is no need for any mass social programs, which have unfortunately been inflated to a huge extent in recent years.
If they managed to cancel a part of the absurd populistic expenditure passed this year before the elections, if the shift of the age limit for retirement and the revision of pensions does not take place soon, all politics in this country will virtually end, regardless of who is leading.
With a bit of exaggeration, we can say that the governing politicians will become white-collar workers, mechanically distributing most of the taxed money between pensions and social benefits.
This year's budget is not revolutionary in any way, it only shifts the mandatory expenditure pushing away normal expenditure.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be totally useless if past governments had not lost as much as they could in the last ten years.
If we do not want to let the governing politicians become mere white-collar workers, we have to allow the not very strong coalition government, which is aware of the fact that the state can give only as much as it can get on taxes and charges, peace for the preparation of other reform laws.
Only they will allow for gradually achieving a balanced state budget.

Banks Want to Solve Crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, The European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have agreed to fight the financial crisis together.
More than $100 billion will enter the monetary markets through public sales.
In public sales, banks bid on the interest rate for which they are willing to borrow money.
The American Fed will send $40 billion into public sale and make 24 more available to European and Swiss Central Banks.
It is the first time after the September 11 attacks that the central banks of individual States agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the effects of a financial crisis.
The first step should solve the most important economic problems, i.e. the growing lack of free capital banks can lend.
The coordinated action of the central banks reduced the likelihood of recession in the US from 65 percent to about 50%, according to the report.
Treasury loans have already lost $60 billion due to non-repaid loans, especially in the USA.
The analysts expect further billion-dollar losses.
The central banks must be very afraid of what more can follow if they decide to favour such a procedure.
It seems to be really bad, he added.
The central banks fear that if the banks have difficult access to loans, they will also lend to their customers for more.
The consumption will fall and send the American economy into recession, with potential impact on the global economic growth.
The central banks made this decision after the failure to lower the so-called LIBOR rate, a London interbank rate, used for lending money on a wholesale market.
The banks still feared mutual money lending, even though the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain reduced their interest rates several times in the fall.
The same effect will be seen as another decrease in interest rates, Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
The analysts do not believe that the central banks' step will help ward the crisis, because it does not solve the main problem, the housing market drop in the USA.
Klaus: Environmentalists' Debates are Unbelievable
Global climate change mostly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has again commented on global warming.
The concluding UNO international conference on climate change in Bali faces his criticism now.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "Blue, Not a Green Planet", he said that the environmentalists' debates were unbelievable.
The conference is not only the structure, which is a strange mix of government officials and nongovernmental organizations that cannot be accepted, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanied it and the reality.
The debate is absolutely unstructured, it is a burst of words which are substitutes for the resolution of current problems.
The Czech president stressed that the topic is very important to him, and that is why he is so interested in it.
The book is also acknowledged as being available in German translation, because, as he says, "I frequently encounter caricatures of my views".
Then now everybody interested can read his uncensored attitudes.
Klaus mentioned that although he is no environmentalist, he believes he has enough qualifications to write such a book.
The academic is able to observe and evaluate technical discourse, he is experienced in statistical analysis and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are that climates change constantly and they are thus normal, that current changes are not too large and relevant and thus do not represent any threat, and that efforts to influence the evolution of the climate are useless, inefficient and unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man with experience in totalitarianism, he considers forcing unsubstantiated opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restraint of freedom, to be unacceptable.
The audience replied that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against the militant environmentalism that does not consider costs and benefits".
Klaus had a similar discussion two months ago at the Hayek Institute in Vienna.
600 Thousand People Did Not Manage to Renew Driver's Licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to renew their old drivers' licenses, which will end in the year.
Today is the last day for people to apply for the renewal so that the authorities can secure the new license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would set out on the road without a valid license after New Year's Eve.
According to the authorities, it is mostly those who do not want to drive anymore who did notrenew the license.
While villages report a sharp decline in interest in driver's license renewal, city authorities are overloaded with applications and the interest has grown this week.
The municipal council handles about 2000 clients a day.
Then they spend about half an hour waiting in line.
Roughly 140,000 drivers have not renewed their driver's license yet in Prague.
The issue of a new license takes twenty days.
However, it is possible to apply for the issue in a reduced time limit of five days.
In this case, the driver pays five hundred crowns extra.
Drivers who do not manage the license before the end of the year and set on the road without a valid driver's license will be threatened with a fine.
The person who breaks the law will be fined at a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can also settle the offence through a settlement.
In case of an administrative offence, the fine will reach 2,500 crowns.
According to earlier information the council could even fine someone who does not drive at all.
Reports indicate that such individual could have paid up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry previously asked the authorities to be reasonable and issue a thousand-crown fine at most.
However, according to Transport Minister Karel Hanzelka, nobody will be threatened with ten-thousand-crown fines.
According to him, a driver's license is a document that people should be allowed to decide whether they want or not.
It is not an identity card which everyone must keep validated.
The people who do not want to drive anymore should give the license up.
It is sufficient to take it to the competent municipal office or send it by registered post.
The licensing rights issued in 1964-1993 will have expired.
However, motorists must also renew other types of driver's licenses.
People with driver's licenses from 1994-2000 have three years to renew.
The validity of the licenses issued 2001-2004 will end in December 2013.
Hanzelka says this concerns around 2.6 million other documents.
Court Reduces Sentences for Detectives Affiliated with Berdych
Crime officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminal conspiracy with the David Berdych gang, will be sent to prison for thirteen and ten years respectively.
It was finally resolved by the High Court in Prague, which thus reduced their sentence by one and two years, respectively.
The original sentence against the Prague Organized Crime Subdivision was 14 and 12 years, respectively.
It is not possible to appeal today's decision, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Though Berdych is charged in this case, he is still waiting for the first instance.
However, he has already been given prison sentence in more than 16 trials.
He cannot get any more.
In January the regional court found 19 people guilty, including all participation in felonies, and the High Court was dissolving the appeals of 16 of them today.
Most of the charged have refuted the indictment from the beginning of the investigation, claiming that it is a fabricated case.
The Central Bohemian Regional Senate reported that the police, after making arrangements with Berdych, gave the information from the police sources to the criminals, cover up individual felonies and helped the gang members to evade their prisons.
In exchange, the gang gave 30 percent of the loot to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment deals with the crimes of the gang from 1999-2001.
Thefts that often resulted in serious physical injuries, but also the abuse of power and possession of illegal weapons.
The police have discovered illegally held arms, steel bullets, laser gunsight or automatic rifle in house searches.
The gang took tens of millions of crowns in the thefts.
Except for the nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have lawfully convicted Berdych and several other people of other thefts.
Other men around Berdych are still testifying in the court in a different trial, but some of the cases have not come to the trial yet.
The trial has thus far avoided Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, currently in an Irish jail, where they are waiting for the decision regarding their version to Czech Republic for prosecution.
Baby Switch accounts: 12 million
The lawyer for the aggrieved families, Igor Veleba, is requesting 12 million Czech crowns for the switch of the babies to a maternity clinic in Třebíč hospital, plus legal costs.
Three million for each mother, two for each father and a million for each child.
The hospital is offering a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's lawyer Ondřej Dostál therefore radically disapproves of Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such claim, it is too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"To define our position to counter-motion, we need the expert opinion of the opposing side.
We will check if it has any informative value at all.
However, we remain in our opinion that it will be in hundreds of thousands for all.
According to him, the sum should range from 100,000 to 200,000 for each of the four parents.
The Jabloňov family asked for a million crowns for every month they were not with their biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert opinion of the Motol University Hospital in Prague as a basis for the negotiations.
According to the psychology and psychiatry advisors, parents of children have suffered psychological injury and stress of varying degrees and intensity.
The stressful situation was better handled by men, though they struggled with remorse that they did not prevent the switch of the newborn babies.
The other women are worse at the urgency of the trauma and what is happening right now, Veleba added.
Veronika and Nikola were switched by the nurses in the Třebíč maternity clinic on December 9.
The children returned to their birth parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Pribyslav, Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
Supervisor Miloš Vystrčil gave 100,000 CZK to each family as compensation for the expenditure caused by the mistake by the Třebíč hospital, run by the county.
All Czech Republic hospitals are insured for liability for damages by law.
In case of error they have to dig into the reserve fund, and in exceptional cases they can seek help from the founder.
The courts have awarded relatively low compensation to people, with the sums calculated according to the table in six digit numbers, exceptionally in seven digit numbers in Czech crowns.
Polív takes the Wallachian Kingdom
Bolek Polívka has lost the case of the Wallachian Kingdom brand name.
The first time he used the term the Wallachian king was in the project, but the project was developed through the long-term efforts of the team around Tomáš Harabiš, who collaborated with the actor.
Mr Polívka was not present at the hearing today.
The lawyer believes the case has not reached its end and his client will appeal.
The issue is that Mr Harabiš and his team sponge off of Bolek Polívka's popularity, according to Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, if you say the Wallachian Kingdom, everyone recalls the actor and comedian.
Mr Harabiš is of the same opinion.
Almost ten years of hard work are behind us.
raising money and designing projects.
According to him the reason for the fight is money.
After years, they realized that the project was successful and that he could profit from it.
They want to sponge off our work," he added.
A Lucrative Business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Wallachia king" for the first time in his TV show.
In 1993, he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
However, at the time it was not related to the intention to build a fictitious kingdom.
However, several years later, Mr Harabiš started issuing Wallachian passports.
From an original prank act, a business and lucrative enterprise have developed, which Harabiš then expanded by establishing the company "Wallachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in passports and even offered discounts on visits to his farm and theatre performances to holders.
Who will ascend to the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabiš only used the bare idea which Polívka made public in the circus for his business plan.
The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Wallachian Kingdom project, according to the judge.
The heart of the project was Harabiš and his team, which has dedicated themselves to it so intensely.
The collaboration of currently quarrelling parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation in Vsetín for Polívka.
Then disputes between Polívka and Harabiš begin to accumulate, which ended in the dethronement of "the king I elected forever and ever".
In response to Harabiš, the leading role in the Kingdom was then taken over by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the Queen Mother.
In 2002 Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court overruled today.
Hassan Harabiš's planned joust for the throne and half of the princess should shed light on the rift.
New king should emerge from the skeleton.
No details or schedule are yet available.
"We do not want to rush things.
It should be something like the King’s ride in Slovácko region.
The King should be elected for a definite time period.
Even Mr Polívka can sign up," added Harabiš.
The Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Melting Prejudices
To tell the truth, I have never rooted for Peugeot 206 too much.
The handling characteristics have not been particularly special, and the quality of gear control, driving control and construction may occasionally be called mediocre.
The Peugeot 207 is now on the market and it is far better.
The station wagon called SW goes even further and I cannot help but to give it another thought.
When I was testing the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about headroom in the back seat.
Here the complaints are over, because the station wagon's body means that not even two-meter tall guys will suffer in this regard.
At a glance
I will pass through the interior quickly, so as not to repeat myself too much.
We have quite an excellent design here, where the only critique I have is the huge central tunnel.
I would like some more designer inventiveness here, as the car itself looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the times when we could have complained about short seats or seat backs are truly behind us.
Also, the lateral seat support has been significantly improved compared to the 206 model.
Considering the space, we can feel the buildup in the body dimensions as well.
In the station, the already mentioned lack of headroom disappears.
Suitcases into the Trunk
The main thing about this car is its trunk.
I must evaluate it as well accessible (thanks also to the hinged quarter window) and very spacious.
The blind spots are equipped with retaining elastics, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not block space, it can be dilated and yet it holds even heavier objects.
Pause to observe the volume.
According to the table it is in 428 l the basic arrangement, which compares to its competitors is quite average.
However, not compared to the best selling car of this class in Bohemia - the Skoda Fabia Station Wagon.
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of Mladá Boleslav products, we will see that the Peugeot lags highly noticeable 52 litres behind.
For vacations in foreign countries or with a baby-carriage load, this number is almost critical.
If I were to focus on the positive points I would have to mention the absolutely flat surface when turning down the seat backs in the second row or the very low threshold.
120 Horses in Four Rows
The test wagon was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with 1.6 l capacity and 88kW power.
The truth is, this is how a 1600 which drives a family hatchback should look.
It is quiet, low expenditure, and above all it really moves.
If I compare it to the Skoda equivalent, which sometimes makes you feel like it has a rag stuck in the exhaust, I cannot help but be very happy.
Hint is in the Price
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we should keep in mind that we have tested a well equipped car with a spacious interior and a good engine.
The basic price of the car with a 1.6 petrol engine is not that bad.
Our assembly costs are minimum 410,900, which is pretty much already.
The tested equipment Premium will include equipment worth some 80, 000 Czech crowns more.
The head airbags, automatic air-condition, automatic screen-wipe activation, the electric rear-window control...
The car costs 531,900 Czech crowns all in all.
This is quite a bit, but if you consider the additional equipment of Fabia, you will get a similar number.
Then there is no other way to do but to choose based on the brand name.
Slovak Pupils in British Schools Not Progressing
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is rising, making local residents fear for the development of the local education system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently struggling with several impediments.
British schools also register cases when disputes between immigrants and children of the original population become violent.
The problem with integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well defined by the situation in north Kent, where tensions between local residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Arguments, bullying and fights between the children have extended to the relations between their parents.
The situation went further, when police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who beat a ten-year-old pupil with an iron cane.
In her own defense, the offender claims that the boy had insulted her with racial slurs.
The police also intervened after an attack by two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls reportedly called the man racist comments and threw stones at him.
The bus stop was a bus stop and a boy climbed onto the bus stop and started to spit on us.
When I asked him to stop it, he slaughtered us with apples and peaches and then showed his nude bottom.
The complaints come from both sides.
One local resident even defined the fighting with Eastern European immigrants as survival fighting.
The above mentioned cases indicate that the mood between locals and immigrants at British schools is beginning to be strained.
There are 70 thousand Slovaks registered in Britain who moved there for work.
Roughly 30 thousand Slovak children then, attend British schools.
Cuba the Most Beautiful Island of the Caribbean
For its visitors it is really an island of freedom.
What you expect from your vacations can happen if you make the right choice.
Golden and lily white beaches, high waves or sea calm as a pond.
The full board with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or potent shakes on the beach.
Kite-surfing, golf and roulette.
The full and even richer list of all this is found on the islands in the Caribbean Sea.
There is only one island where you can find much more, and that island is Cuba, the biggest and most beautiful of West Indies.
Under the reign of Spaniards, Cuba was the stronghold of American conquest.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place man has ever seen.
Havana became a storage and transfer centre for the Spaniards’ stolen treasures in America and transported to Europe.
American era came.
The National Hotel was built in the late 1920s.
The building was initiated by one of the American Mafia bosses, Lucky Luciano, because all that was illegal in the US (especially during the prohibition) was welcome and supported in Cuba, drugs, gambling, prostitution.
among his guests were, among others, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rises were built in Havana, and cars which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s took the wide avenues.
Ernest Hemingway bought a homestead in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and he had a yacht in Cojímar.
The movie stars and politicians from America were leaving their signatures on the wall of Bodeguita del Medio.
What is today?
Even you can leave your autograph on the wall in the Havana Bodeguita.
They will mix a shake according to your wishes in the expensive Hotel Nacional.
The cult cars from the 1950s have been driving around Havana ever since, because the once imported Zhiguli and Fiat vehicles have died in the salty and damp weather.
Though Havana, particularly its oldest part, is significantly squalid, nowhere else in the surroundings is such a large number of colonial sights.
Other places have also been transformed into beauty, e.g. Trinidad.
With regard to the fact that tourism brings in badly needed money, its development has the green light.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana but also on small islands such as Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another rare rarity which is unique in the world, of special value to train lovers.
The sugar cane from the vast plantations was transported to the sugar mills on narrow rails by a small steam locomotive and motor trains.
Their wagon stock has not been renovated for decades and you can see functional trains there whose contemporaries are now only in museums.
How to go?
Most Cuban visitors will not miss the best known spots.
Then no need to get into much detail about Varadero or Havana.
Maybe to mention that there is a museum in Hemingway homestead mentioned above and those who like this author should not miss the visit.
Viňales Valley The Viňales Valley in the western part of the island is one of the most picturesque spots in Cuba.
Lush vegetation grows from the limestone bedrock.
Gogotes, limestone-covered mountains and rocks rise up steeply from the bottom of the valley and fertile soil has taken hold in the cavities, thus even the dilapidated rocks are covered with thick overgrowth.
The Valley is a place where probably the most exclusive Cuban tobacco is grown.
The final shape can be seen in one of Havana’s cigar making factories.
The fact that the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed may also be of interest to some.
Trinidad and Tobago
The city was established shortly after the Spaniards invaded the island.
fame and fortune were brought there with the slave and sugar trade.
Fortune transformed into beauty and imposing architecture of the small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, which was very influenced by the later French colonists, has not changed much in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is a place so remote that even in the 1950s there was no road to connect the area to the rest of the country.
The isolation helped it stay apart from it.
Nothing was being built there, so nothing was being torn down either.
If you have more time to Trinidad than one afternoon, other interesting places in the vicinity are worth visiting, such as the Ancón beach or the Sugarmill Valley.
In the evening, it is appropriate to go to Casa de la Musica, which becomes full of life at nightfall and the music abates there at dawn.
Baracoa
The tiny town easternmost end of Cuba is often called the most beautiful one on the island.
This opinion is certainly influenced by the road leading to it.
Both roads leading to Guantanámo must pass through high and rugged mountains and they go through natural surroundings nearly untouched by human activity.
The Eastern Cape of Cuba has been placed on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate there is, they have a Columbus cross in a church (which was actually created about one hundred years after Columbus's voyage), and from the hill where the former castle and what is now the hotel El Castillo stand, you can see several tables, of which the Yunque is the most famous.
The entire world can fill many pages with coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the Holy Patron Saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santería, and African religions, which are believed by the descendants of former slaves.
The real phrase goes, see it once.
Allies in Afghanistan Passive, Americans Say
The US says that the low number of soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment are affecting the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should design a concrete plan for the following years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not proceeding as expected, the representatives of the countries which have posted units in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing reluctance of the Taliban movement, eight participant states will discuss other plans and coordination of the alliances today.
The US ordered the NATO units through the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to increase activity this week, while Great Britain sees the priority in strengthening the Afghan government authority and intensifying developmental aid.
The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but armed forces can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the inhabitants to expand further economy and security themselves.
Ninety Percent
The highest activity of the Afghan rebels has been reported from the US Army in the last five years.
The number of violent acts rose 27 percent compared to last year, almost 60 percent in the southern Helmand province.
The NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, about half of whom are in the southern territory.
The US says they have reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
The requests are specifically for helicopters, soldiers and experts on Afghan unit training.
They will have to think hard about the concrete goals for the coming era and how to reach them.
The Secretary General of NATO Jaap de Hoop spoke today with similar intent.
"I am not happy about what we have on ground and in air in Afghanistan.
They have about nine percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is little.
Who Is Passive
There are some disputes among the countries involved over whether all the alliances are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany has been criticised for passivity.
"Germans have a very large presence in Afghanistan.
They are stationed in areas of minimum violence and the combat requirements on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country.
The British tabloid The Sun called German soldiers as lazy this week.
The Sun reported on material accompanied by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild took back and printed a photo of a British unit during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
National Debt to Vault to a Trillion in 2009
There is a national debt of more than 84 000 crowns for each Czech.
The total debt reached in September to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
The ministry cut the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to improved development of the state budget.
The Czech Republic's national debt rose by September to 842.7 billion crowns.
It has risen by 40.2 billion crowns in the nine months of this year.
Though it has declined by 13.4 billion crowns since June.
This is how the Finance Ministry confirmed its data on the national debt from the beginning of October today.
The debt of more than 84,000 crowns for each Czech.
During the last year, the state incurred debts of more than 111 billion crowns.
However, thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we should not break the trillion crown limit until 2009.
Next year the debt will range from 900 billion to trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHned.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees it similarly:
The exact date will depend on the next budget, which we do not know yet.
If the situation in the political arena change, politicians would be willing to spare more, it could be postponed to 2010.
It is not predictable.
Loans Are Growing
National debt is the debts of the central government and emerges mainly due to the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The national debt is financed by treasury notes, government bonds, direct loans or loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has risen 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The foreign debt of the state has risen 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns this year.
The so-called marketable national debt reached 803.3 billion crowns in September and has declined 13.7 billion crowns since June.
The average due date of the national debt rose to 6.5 years.
The total interim debt for the first to third quarter rose 13 percent, which is quite a lot compared to the economic situation.
What is interesting is that the growth is mainly generated through bonds, where the growth is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that we have something to trade when the pension reform comes.
Better than Expected
It follows from the 2007 National Debt Financing and Control strategy that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
The ministry then reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to improved development of the state budget.
The sum is mainly the state budget deficit, which will likely reach 76 billion crowns instead of the assumed 91.3 billion crowns this year.
The planned maximum resources of 13.3 billion crowns for the Czech Consolidation Agency, a ten billion reserve for pension pay-outs, financing of government bonds for 43 billion crowns and the instalment payment of the European Investment Bank totalling 1.8 billion crowns.
Today she appeared before Khartum court for having named a teddy bear.
The English teacher tried in Sudan for offending Islam has been sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment and to expulsion, according to her lawyer.
The English teacher has been accused of allowing her children between 6 and 7 to give Muhammad to a teddy bear, when every representation of the prophet is banned.
She was liable to lashes punishment.
This 54-year-old English teacher, who was working at the Unity High School of Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested last Sunday at her home, with the accusation of threatening Islam and sedition, according to Article 125 of the Sudanese criminal code.
The case goes back to September, when the teacher asked her children, aged 6 and 7, to pick a name for the class teddy bear.
Eight names came out from the children's mouth, among them Hassan, Abdullah and Muhammad.
After the class’ vote, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Muhammad as their favourite name.
Muhammad is the name of the Muslim prophet, but first of all it is a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class with the bear picture followed by the legend «My name is Muhammad».
The bear itself did not wear any label with that name, but the problem lies in the prophet's representation, considered as an offence to Islam.
The Muslim colleague of Gillian Gibbons, who is a teacher in the same school in Sudan, has emphasized that she never would have done anything offensive for any religion.
It is a common opinion among many of the teacher's students, who describe her as “very attentive to her students” and “a person who never talks about religion in the class”.
Moreover, Muhammad is the second most common name in Great Britain, which is written in 14 different ways.
This name, which is often chosen by Muslim families, is one way of honouring the prophet (it is often given to the firstborn).
What rules govern the use of that name?
If you give it to a toy, is it possible to give it to a toy?
It is a matter of interpretation.
The province has not reached any accord on its future statute on Wednesday, during the last negotiation session in Vienna.
At the end, the failure.
Kosovo Serbians and Kosovo Albanians completed on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, the sixth and last meeting of negotiations without being able to resolve their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
The European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger told a press conference in Vienna.
While emphasizing that the region was “at risk”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, called for continued peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
While violence is not expected, we are in a difficult period, which is a very difficult period, he has added, emphasizing the “existence of important tensions”.
End of the mediation on 10th December.
The last third mediators, which gathers the European Union, USA and Russia, will travel to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province populated 90% by Albanian-speaking people will be clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will have submitted their report to the UN Security Council on 10 December.
Baden's discussions, near Vienna, were the sixth and last meeting since the troika was charged with new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10th December.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of Kosovo independence, are insisting on continuing negotiations beyond this date.
Moscow has been and remains committed to negotiated solution, a compromise solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of United Nations administration in Kosovo, Westerners believed that independence under the EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is ready to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council is not in its favour.
Belgrade is pressing for more autonomy.
However, no agreement was reached, announced Sejdiu in the Baden hotel where the last chance negotiations have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the ex-commander of Kosovo rebels and future minister of the province, expressed his regret.
The proposal of Belgrade’s autonomy plan was a past which led to murder and deportation.
«Domino effect»
The Serbian President Boris Tadic suggested that a compromise was still possible, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of independence for the province.
Belgrade fears a “domino effect” in a fragile region, weakened by the 1990s independence wars.
However, for Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.
The Serbian delegation insisted that every decision should be taken at the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto.
«Kosovo's Parliament will have the last word»
The only acceptable solution for Serbia is in the Security Council, according to Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
«These negotiations have been going on for two years.
«They should end as they started: within the Security Council.»
Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the statute, adding that every unilateral declaration of independence from Albanian-speaking people would be done by consulting Westerners.
Bush snatch an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
The president of the United States, George Bush, announced at the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
The Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert agreed to start immediate negotiations to resolve the 60 year contention between them.
The two men have promised to do everything to help them reach a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians have to demolish "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel has to stop its settlement activities, which has been agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim at "the conclusion of a peace treaty resolving every outstanding issue, without any exception, central issues included".
This term covers three thorny issues at the heart of the current conflict between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in the current State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Following the American president, Abbas stressed on future "global and in-depth" negotiations based on a regulation, mentioning among others "Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, water and security".
The speech of Olmert called for "direct and continuous" negotiations and to work to end them in 2008.
Since 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementing his "vision of two coexisting states" of Israel and Palestine.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it secured a commitment from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Associated with all Arab countries, Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origin of a plan which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its own territories during the 1967 war, East Jerusalem included.
Annapolis is a crossroad in Middle East history, particularly because it faces the roots and its central aspects, Prince Saud says in an interview with an Arabic newspaper.
The prosecutor says the police is not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always, official versions and rumours are the opposite.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation, a police car was moving around on Sunday, shortly after 5 pm, Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel.
The emergency was not involved, they were on patrol and the car circulated at 40-50 km / h, without flashing lights.
Green Kawazaki motorbike, “not approved, so not allowed to travel on public roads” (read above), driven by two guys without helmets, travelled «at great speed».
« It hit the police car on the left, failing to give way to its right», a policeman said.
The results of the alcohol test were negative on motorbike owners.
The state of the car (the front of the car broken, the windscreen crushed, the bumper ripped) shows the violence of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Pontoise Republic prosecutor, Marie Thérèse de Givry, announced she was entrusted an investigation to the IGNP for “manslaughter and non-assistance to people in danger”.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the Attorney General states that the IGPN investigation at this stage has discarded the police responsibility.
The prosecutor says three witnesses of the accident, questioned on Sunday evening, confirmed «the police's version, that the mini-motorbike arrived quite quickly on their left hand.
Today, a groove, probably caused by the toeclip's rubbing, showed that the two vehicles got stuck until the car stopped.
Both vehicles have been confiscated and will be passed under technical expertise.
The autopsy on two victims'bodies was conducted yesterday.
What happened immediately after?
Today, rumours have quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, which says the police have soon left the place without helping the two people.
According to that point, the IGNP, remaining cautious, would reject any serious mistake.
The most difficult aspect of the investigation is the investigation, which requires more investigations, towards which it is necessary to be very careful.
The Libyan Press Agency has met one eyewitness among those who have seen the accident.
One of his window looked directly on the scene.
The witness explains that we went off immediately, me and my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital trying to revive them.
There was no left to do.
Then he saw a policeman completely shocked, limping.
The other people tried to revive them, and a fourth person was talking on the phone.
The police have been driven away by some colleagues who have arrived on the scene.
Always according to this witness, the emergency service arrived «about 20 minutes after the police departure».
They have also tried cardiac massage, without any result.
«I will not allow anyone to say that the police did not help them.
The emergency service was attended.
The fire brigade was immediately coming.
Everything has been done to help them.
The tension increases in Pakistan
The Pakistani police repressed on Monday the first demonstrations since the declaration of emergency by General Musharraf two days before.
In Lahore, in the East of the country, about 2.000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken within the state of emergency were wounded by the tear gas canisters used by the police, explained some witnesses.
The police respond by throwing stones, injuring some policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were questioned.
Similar situations in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where some policemen have beaten and injured some lawyers.
Many people were questioned.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court bar pulled a strike and announced future demonstrations after a wave of about 500 arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers during the week.
The road leading to the Supreme Court was blocked on Monday morning to prevent the meeting.
Other demonstrations occurred in Multan (in the centre) and in Peshawar (in the North-West).
The lawyers' movement received on Monday support from the religious parties gathered in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president asked the population to send flowers to judges who declared themselves against the state of emergency and wastes to those who took oath in front of Musharraf.
"Musharraf breaks his promise"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly involved with emergency measures announced on Saturday evening.
Next days, the Supreme Court was expected to take a decision on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election, which occurred on 6th October.
The Court President, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been ousted and replaced.
'All that we are attending is illegal, anticonstitutional and against the Supreme Court's decisions.
The promise of Pervez Musharraf of being a civil president is broken with the announcement of the state of emergency, declared on Monday the Information minister Tariq Azeem.
The army was expected to leave by 15 November, with the expiration of his first presidential mandate.
Moreover, the Information minister confirmed that the January elections could be delayed.
The Pakistani government denied those rumors that President Musharraf would have been house arrested.
More than a third of pregnancies occur unexpectedly.
This estimate includes unwanted pregnancies (24 %) and unplanned births.
Today, more than one pregnancy out of three (36 %) is still unplanned, according to a survey conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the Neuwirth law, which legalized contraception in France, was voted.
This estimate includes unwanted pregnancies (24 %) and unplanned births.
Different contraceptives, such as the pill or the coil, have a failure rate of between 5% and 6%, according to the Ined.
In contrast, the legalization of contraception led to better fertility control, explains the Institute, according to which the use of the pill among women between 20 and 44 years old has now risen to 60 %, compared to 5 % in 1970.
Finally, nowadays eight births out of ten are well planned.
One couple out of five would even plan the birth month, when possible going for springtime, considered the best period for having a child.
Special repair on the space station
The astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew spent more than seven hours working in space repairing a mangled solar array, essential to continue scientific activities at the station.
The dangerous spacewalk which sets records in its length, distance from the habitable module, its speed and in the “repairing” tools used by the astronauts.
The problem started Tuesday, when the astronauts pulled the Harmony module from the Discovery space shuttle, a large cylindrical piece holding European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see figure).
This module is a sort of deck landing for the modules-laboratories.
It is necessary to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a 17,5 tons solar module for solar arrays, which was already in the ISS.
After moving the module, the crew started using its solar arrays, which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
It was there that a solar array, rising like an accordion, was roped.
In order to prevent further damage, the array was stopped from bending.
The astronauts, whose spacewalk was to check the Discovery shuttle and repair another solar array with faulty rotation system, had to repair the damaged one too.
Scott Parazynski was chosen for the stitching, on the end of the 58-foot robot arm that was added for repair.
The best NASA spacewalker is a fellow of NASA.
The man is tall, strong, very capable, he has a great chest and long arms.
At age 46, with a past medical carrier, he was charged with “operating” on that “wounded” solar array.
After examining the damage, he dissected the wrong rope and fixed a sort of “splint” on the mangled area.
The spacewalker has been helped by another spacewalker who stayed next to him, while his crew and its leader Peggy Whitson was helping him from the inside.
The tool he used, a tiny hockey stick wrapped in insulator to prevent electrocution on the solar arrays producing hundreds of volts, was planned and created in the space station.
After the operation, after checking his tools and returning to the station, Scott Parazynski waited for the solar array to completely unfold.
Yesterday, in the afternoon, the astronauts had half day of rest, and seven astronauts are now ready to leave on the Discovery shuttle, coming back to Earth on Wednesday.
EADS shares approved in the Stock Exchange
EADS shares are very low in Paris Stock Exchange, since the aeronautic and defence company has announced its willingness to spend between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros to deal with the A400M delay.
EADS is losing 4% (at 21.96 euros) on Paris Stock Exchange.
The group had to revise its 2007 operational results due to the slow development progression of the A400M engine, which affects the inauguration flight of the plane.
The cost for overcoming the delay in delivery of this aircraft, announced in October, is around 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion goes for Airbus.
Because of these charges, EADS will have to announce new EBIT targets for 2007 on Thursday, added without any information about prices.
The group states that the estimation of the new charges is consistent with the six months' delay.
It should be remembered that EADS operational result declined by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the one of A380 shareholder.
The group expected to deliver the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Status quo choice
The polling is without any suspense on Sunday, with Russia’s citizens increasingly voting for the President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Confirming this way their aim to stability, event to authoritarianism, after an intense campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, the Russian president Vladimir Putin appeals to his voters with a TV message on public networks, which has been registered but its content is kept secret.
The lead candidate of United Russia is a pro-Kremlin party, for which the overwhelming victory is expected.
Yesterday, welcomeing the foreign ambassadors, the President did not betray anything, bringing only a further charge against the West, accused of interference - his favorite subject during the campaign.
”We know the price of a true democracy and we expect fair, absolute clear and open elections without obstacles.
According to the opposition, this result seems too far.
It denounces an under pressure campaign.
The Soviet leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that “never have been so dirty elections, even in the Soviet times”.
After the last week’s demonstrations, it is still forbidden to visit the ex world champion of flop, Garry Kasparov, who was sentenced to five days’ imprisonment for illegal demonstration, said his lawyer.
« Russians saved the homo sovieticus mentality. »
Behind those without any suspense, there are two wider questions:
Who will be Putin's successor?
The official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the elections, on 2 March 2008; candidates have time to submit their candidates.
The first time he was elected in 2000 and for the second time in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot afford a third mandate.
At present, no emerging successor is available.
- What role is Putin going to play after March?
Minister?
The majority of the parliament and the most powerful party United Russia, will choose both the government and the president?
Whatever the case may be, at the legislative elections, as well at the presidential ones, the outgoing party will triumph.
It is a tradition.
They saved the homo sovieticus mentality, they do not feel the owner of their destiny, says Lev Goudkov, Director of Levada independent centre.
Nikolai Kopossov, a historian of St. Petersburg State University, goes further: the civil society in this Christianized country was five centuries later than in Europe; the well-known community attitude postponed the birth of individualism.
After liberal reforms of 1990s, Putin returned to a paternalistic state, which was perfectly accepted by the population, considering that the new paternalism was not followed by a period of terror but by economic growth.
Russians are "voluntarily renouncing the personal responsibility” that they had briefly shown after the collapse of the URSS.
What is considered then?»
The phenomenon affects every social class, including business.
The administrative elite aims to keep the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 leaders of Russian regions) are heading the local lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as it happened in the 1990s.
The public opinion prefers stability.
It is the reason why Russians do not vote for extremists.
Here are Tamara Tcheredinchenko conclusions, 54 years old professor:
The people in power are not so bad, why change them?
The weight of past
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which explain the fate of 17,5 million victims of Hitler dictatorship, can be accessed.
The 47 million documents collected in the archives, arranged on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were until now only available for humanitarian purposes, either individually or by those entitled to.
The eleven states responsible for their administration -including Germany, France, Israel and the United States- agreed on May 2006 to make them available for research workers and historians.
Complete the ratification process of the agreement, the archives are available since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The historians access to the archives will particularly allow research on the prisoners' movement, the camp population and health of forced labourers , explains Reto Meistern, Director of the archives for the International Council of Croix-Rouge (CICR).
Up to now many countries, including Germany, have rejected public access of these private documents, because of the sensitive nature of some information.
Like homosexuality or mental handicap of some deported victims.
The records of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants established by the Gestapo were collected at the end of the war with a practical purpose: identifying the detained people or people under forced labor and, eventually, demonstrating their internment to allow them to get their compensation.
Today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees still receive tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for some scientific community members, access to Bad Arolsen is limited.
The document is not new to learn from it , declared in 2006 the Dr Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Research Centre on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität of Berlin.
The EU and India are willing to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European trade is already reaching about 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s major trading partner and represents the 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU and India are planning to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, explained the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The EU Ministers for Foreign Affairs gave the European Commission the permission to enter into negotiations in April to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with India, South Korea and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s major trading partner and represents the 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its major foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trade partner of the EU, according to European Commission data.
The free trade agreement will considerably improve both economies and "India would have a huge access to 450 million tons of trade to Europeans" explains Mandelson.
The EU and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi, in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England responds to concerns by lending 10 billion pounds for five weeks
The Bank of England announced on Thursday its aim to cast aside inflation concerns and will lend 10 billion pounds at its benchmark interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks.
In order to cast aside concerns that the financial market will be particularly thin at the end of the year and to give banks greater confidence in their liquidity management, the Bank will offer a substantial proportion of its reserves during the scheduled maintenance period starting on 6th December, with an operation of five weeks open market.
The Bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be lent at base rate from 6 of December at 12H15 GMT until January.
The first time that the BoE lends liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
The funding is usually offered over a one week period.
The BoE says in its press release that it is ready to adopt further measures to maintain the daily day by day interbanking loans in line with its basic rate.
The day by day interbanking rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three month rate was 6.6%, the highest since 18 September.
The financial crisis has been a significant threat to the intervention of the banks.
The rumors, confirmed by the change in the pound's quotation against the Euro, many people preferred the offer of the European Central Bank, at profitable rates and with confidence.
UMP and NC do not agree to review PS's proposed purchasing power proposal
UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss some parts of the socialist bill on purchasing power, meaning they refused the text.
The text rejected dozens of measures taken on Tuesday by the National Office of the PS, including the 50% increase in the employment allowance, the TIPP reintroduction, cheque-transport or the rental charge control.
Since UMP and NC voted against those sections of the bill (180 against 115 votes), the meeting closed at the end of a often heated discussion between majority and opposition, a few hours after the television speech of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The PS leader, Jean Marc Ayrault, announced that his group will represent the integrity of his proposals by moving an amendment to the financial bill which will be examined by the Commission in the next week.
New festival is coming up.
After many rumours about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, this promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic, organized by the British producer Melvin Benn.
” It is an honour to work with someone who has even inspired the current festival movement in America,” says Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago’s Lollapalooza festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is expected to be held on a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia and last from August 8 to 10th.
The Director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989 he organized the UK Reading Festival, which every year attracts about 80 000 people.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his portfolio the Leeds Festival and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
From 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has been charged with production, licences concession and the organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which now can host up to 177 500 people.
The most inspiring event he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn's one are working together to give the region a European festival/event.
The chosen city is Philadelphia as our business and we are hardly working with the Fairmount Parks Commission for creating a festival in the centre of Philadelphia.
« We were negotiating with the city and the Commission was very interested in our proposal.
The current administration has kept us behind in political issues, says Charlie Jones.
Because we could talk to Melvin Benn and we are going to create a wonderful festival in an extraordinary place that will be useful for Philadelphia's population.
C3 Presents revived Lollapalooza festival in 2005 in Chicago Grant Park, after its intervention in the festival setting in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
In 2007, The two events have respectively registered 9,8M$ and 11,1M$ gross receipts.
Both festivals take place in an urban area.
The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours take place in open urban spaces.
The aim is to mix these two different models, in order to give the same impression of a European country festival and an American urban one.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
”Vineland’s community, its mayor included, supports with a huge enthusiasm this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The agreement is without conditions, but he states “that they will allow us to invest in such a great event and host a festival that we hope will last for a long time.
Charlie Jones says the festival will have a “huge” capacity, giving the example of the Tennessee Bonnaroo Music Festival, which hosted 80 000 people.
The invitations have been extended to the groups, but no confirmation is yet available.
”Vineland will not be a rock festival, there will be various genres of music, in order to attract every kind of audience ”, says Charlie Jones.
The partners of C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award at last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It is not easy for Montreal to attract Hollywood movies when the rejector is Terminator...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate's functions.
The politics of the investigation is difficult, as the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, calls the “runaway productions”.
It is difficult to play the role of the “Governor”?
«You need to be careful, it's the industry that decides where to go.
If it finds good conditions in Montreal, it will go there.
Our role is to offer the best conditions.
The festivals race
Denis Turcotte is currently focusing on promoting our cinema.
The Oscars race has start.
All West Coast festivals, taking place in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebec films, give prominence to them and ensure that all directors meet.
Days of Darkness had a good presentation at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be introduced at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be introduced at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec has also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
The experts are divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
With less than five weeks to close the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands for the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year the experts do not know if this will happen.
Banif believes that December usually has a positive effect on the stock market.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based on statistics, especially in the present context, where uncertainties are visible in the markets, at least for the short term.
Although they are not in favor of a stock-market run in the last weeks of the year, they point to "the stock market, which is maintained by liquidity, arranged to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed rent, affected by the flushed effect to quality shares as much in the long term as in the short one".
The economists believe that the stock market will have a very lateral behaviour, non-volatility, so we do not know the impact of the Fed's probability reduction types on the high level of crude oil and the stimulating danger of inflationary tensions.
Javier Barrio, sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not the time to take risks, thinking that there will be a rally.
"It is not a pleasing thing", says the expert.
Ibex has lost nearly 4% from the maximum reached on November 8th, when the index closed at 15945.7 points.
Even so, not all experts share this negative viewpoint.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year nearer to 16000 points thanks to portfolio reconstruction and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert says that the rally will occur in the second week of December, after the Constitution holiday.
The analyst does not consider that volatility is going to affect the market trend.
The other hand, Federico Olucha, Inversis Bank analyst, believes that we are close to technical levels and "therefore, as far as the consequences of the crisis on the credit market, we could see a rebound in the index based on the news from the USA.
The analyst believes that this will be positive.
The analysts agree to select the shares that will be the ones in charge of taking Ithebex to new maximum levels.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that this year it is the turn for the great stocks.
The expert would include in his portfolio both: great banks and some constructors, because when the date is coming, the electrical sector will be very expensive.
While, Federico Olucha of Inversis Bank says that the coming incomes will come from the banking and industrial sectors.
The constructors also will be able to benefit from this rally if it happens.
ACS takes several months to recover, and we hope that other construction companies like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path.
The consumer cycle will be the main focus in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales figures during the Christmas sales season.
The expert believes that the technological sales will also do well, but in this case there is no much presence in the Spanish market.
Five times seven years of age
In the last seven years only two times December has been a bearish month.
The authentic year end rally occurred in 2003 exercise, where stock markets left the crisis caused by the technological bubble.
This year, where Ibex 35 recovered 28,17%, December registered a growth of 6,68%.
The following year is the fifth consecutive year of gains (Ibex has risen 8,36% since January) and whether there will be a year-end rally.
Popular will open its 200 offices for 12 hours daily from Monday to Saturday.
Popular has decided to renew large part of their offices.
In total 200, located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
The new branches will be operated under the mark Popular Max and represent a big change for the bank.
This is also true for the rest of the Spanish banks, since this is the first group to decide to propose an all day aperture for their offices, until 20.30 in the evening, and on Saturdays from 1000 to 2030 hours.
The other group that has repeatedly reiterated its intention to extend its branches’ opening times, BBVA, has not yet decided to make the move.
While, it is close to closing an agreement with the unions who insist on closure of 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening late.
Results from Popular's experience will be decisive for other banks to follow the initiative, depending on commercial hours.
In fact this is the objective that Popular is aiming at with this project.
To catch the particular clients circulating in these zones to make their purchases, to SMEs, independent and commercial sales of the selected street to open.
The bank needs to have these 200 offices open in all Spain within 18 months, since they are not building new offices but remodelling existing offices.
The organization will modernize the branches that it has in commercial zones, adapting them to the different clients profile of different street.
This way, the extension of the opening times is accompanied by a different space concept of the branch and a new design with more luminous colours.
The manager of the commercial bank Angel Creek says that this reconstruction does not require much investment, but increase in staff is required since one needs to go from about six employees at the premises to eight or nine.
The offices, even have meeting rooms for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
One positive experience for the group.
Popular has tested its initiative on three offices in Madrid.
It has been a positive experience, according to Ángel Rivero's explanation.
Bravo Murillo, O'Neil and Gran Via streets in Madrid have been selected, and it seems to be with success, according to Rivero.
Today Popular accounts for 2500 branches.
Others are operating through the Mundocredit trademark, specifically for immigrants, with extended opening times and even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax offices they do not replicate the BBVA model, where several of their offices have a wide range of non-financial products for their commerce.
"We do not want to compete with our clients", says Rivero.
In the past, they have agreed to sell cell phones to employees outside the bank.
The first time Telecinco doubles its stock market value compared to its rival Antenna 3
"We have done it".
With that phrase Paolo Vasile, Executive Advisor of Telecinco, expressed yesterday his satisfaction at the market closure, when he stated that it had reached double the value of its rival, Antenna 3.
Only one aspect diminishes his joy: "I feel a little sick, not because we have grown more but because we have lowered less", he says.
However, he maintained that in a weak market, we have fallen less.
Telecinco closed the day with a 2,54% advance yesterday.
The gain increases the loss we suffered for the year at 15,66%.
The value of the company's shares, controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital and participating by Vocento (another 13%), at the stock market reached 4,488.88 million Euros, according to Bloomberg data.
It’s rival, Antenna 3, that yielded 1.5% and which yesterday accumulated a slope of 40.5% from January, is valued at half that, at 2,193.46 million.
Other quoted communication companies increase; to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable, 2518.53 million for Prisa (publisher of Five Days) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, “we are talking about two similar companies” and thus the comparison with Antenna 3 is a comparison with Antenna 3.
The fact is how much we can operate in the same market, at what cost, and how we can profit in terms of customers.
Television chain Telecinco announced last week that it is expected to become the first TV chain to reach the 1,000 million gross advertising income, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the dedicated advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the branch that manages the publicity of the group.
If the published data is true, the network has registered this year an increase of 3,6% in publicity revenue compared to the 965.4 million of the 2006 exercise.
The net revenue of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the exercise (reaching 734.4 million), while the net income of the television creased by 0.7% (610,4 million).
The most important factors that analysts point to as evidence of the evolution of Telecinco in the stock market is the high payout that has been maintained since 2006: in 2006, the company distributed 100% of the benefit to its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is too late to make a decision, the ratio may change after acquiring 33% of Endemol in partnership with Mediaset.
Officially, we are committed to paying out a minimum 50% of the damage, but we have always declared more.
This year I hope that we can leave our shareholders, who have already given good value with 33% of Endemol, satisfied.
According to the analysts, the market is going on fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimated benefit on Telecinco for 2008 to 4%, and 2009 to 7%.
It happens, they explain, because of the cut in the expected growth of income from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.1% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same company has reduced the forecasted profit of Antenna 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.
Three views
1. 1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both shares based mainly on its high dividend yield and sustainable long-term potential.
2.
Mercado Madrid: Viewed Telecinco as better (to accumulate) than Antenna 3 (to keep) for the 'multiples attracting' and business increase.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to weigh both cases for similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of Mifid that occurred on November 1st.
Following its parliamentary proceedings, which ended today with the partial vote of the Congress on the amendments to the project in the Senate, the government has submitted to public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of different groups agreed on the efforts of deputies and senators to negotiate and agree the best legislation for guaranteeing the protection of investors and regulating the organization activities so that the markets work efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves modernization of financial markets, strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Commission for the Mercado de Valores (CNMV), and promoting cooperation among the European Union’s supervisors.
The new regulations will grant financial advice to specialized companies and to natural or legal individuals, and creates a new type of financial advisory companies (ESIS), which include stock firms, brokers and portfolio management firms.
In addition, it expands the number of systems available for the execution of financial operations, so included in the regulation are secondary markets, multilateral trading systems, and internalization systems of orders, these will compete with the current stock market managers.
The law also requires investment services companies to disclose key details of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management, and to keep a registry of all their operations to facilitate the supervision by the CNMV.
In their passage through the Economic Affairs Committee of the Congress, several modifications were introduced, most notably securitised debts should be considered as a "complex" financial instrument due to its high risk for the investor, which has been evidenced by what happened with high risk American mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition used the directive to legally define the functions that can develop graduates in Economics and Finance in 30 years after the declaration of 1977, that defines the professional functions reserved for professional economists.
The Senate promotes the development of new roles in the financial sector, such as the financial advisor, who will work for hire or reward, not require SEC approval and will be able to provide his services and marketing products to customers at several investment firms at the same time.
The harmonized IPC increases five tenths in November to 4.1%.
This indicator, later serving Eurostat to incorporate in the European Union inflation rate calculation, provides a prediction of how Spain’s prices would evolve in November.
It is published in line with Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy to provide high quality, timely data comparable with the data produced in the USA.
This advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using different statistical methods to account for information that is not available at the time of its publication.
INE stressed that the information provided by the indicator is only an example, and it must not necessarily coincide with the final data, which will be announced next December 14.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels".
The second Vice President and Economy Minister, Pedro Solbes, has stated that the IPC increase to 4.1% in November is a "temporary figure", but has also expressed hopes that the index prices will continue at "relatively high" levels for the next months.
In any case Solbes has stressed that "although the figure is not good" Spanish inflation differential with the European Union continues to be "more or less" as in recent years.
Also explained that November has been less surprise than in the previous month, when the Government expected such a high increase.
"We expect a figure of around 4%", according to the Economy minister.
Virgin planning to make with Northern Rock 42,000 euros million in three years.
Northern Rock deposits have fallen 50% to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it went into crisis in middle September and had to resort to emergency credit from the Bank of England.
The time it needed over 25,000 million pounds of deposits, a figure that has gradually declined in the last two months due to the distrust of its clients and in spite of the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money offered by the Government and who will maintain it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, that would rename the organization to its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs around a quarter of revenue in British banks that are deposited in next three years to acquire the remaining 18,000 million pounds to achieve the 30,000 million goal.
The group of the wealthy tycoon Richard Branson, known for his stunning advertising campaigns in the UK, plans to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on public relations and marketing research to achieve his purposes.
Northern Rock named this week the partnership of Virgin, which includes three other companies, as its favorite to rescue it from bankruptcy.
Totana's mayor was detained for a suspected plot of city-planning corruption
Today, early in the morning, the Crimean Guard has detained the current mayor of Totana (Popular Party) for allegedly connected with the city-planning corruption plot uncovered this week.
Also arrested was the secretary of the consortium and the head of the Municipal Police.
Jose Martinez Andreo, who last May was replaced by Juan Morales, current popular deputy and then alderman of the municipality, could be the lead of this plot.
agents continue to register municipal dependants and the Urban Council and more arrests are not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer Juan Morales has been named as the main suspect of the city-planning corruption plot uncovered in the beginning of this week.
The Chain SER reported yesterday that the lawyer of the Deputy Deputy Juan Morales, who was arrested, left the Morales address with important documents related to the plot.
More, the subject of the investigation is the presumed fees paid by Morales in exchange for facilitating the company/signing of a city-planning agreement with a Galician construction company to re-equal 200 ha of land.
At the moment, there are eight people detained.
Bono accepts to head the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and to preside over the Congress if won.
The ex-Defense minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the government president and General Secretary of the Socialists, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in case the Socialists gain the general elections.
This was announced in a press conference by the Organization of the PSOE, Jose Blanco, and Bono himself after the meeting held in the federal seat of the party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive has justified the offer to the ex-minister because "it is important to have the best" in politics and Bono is among the best.
In addition, it was also pointed out that the Manchego group socialist candidate will preside the Congress if the Socialists win in the next election.
would replace the Congress president Manuel Marín, who on 15 November announced his decision to not stand for the next general elections and to abandon his career in politics to fight climate change in university level.
The ex-minister recognises that the Government President has not stopped insisting on his return to the political front since he left two years ago.
In addition, he has added that, like the citizens know who will be the economic vice-president if the PSOE wins the election, they have wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in a "transparency act".
If he takes office, he hopes to make the House "a house of respect and not insult or shout".
sometimes it seems that the only place in Madrid where it is possible to speak with confidence and calmness is the Congress, the President of the Republic on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times.
Also, he has praised the current president, Manuel Marín and "the good work he is doing", not to fall into what his adversaries might consider as "arrogance".
Climatic propaganda
Given that the movement against the climatic change, under threat from the sceptics of its predictions, must show a determination.
As the leader of the movement and as the President of the Government Zapatero believes that this fight is more important than the one on Islamic terrorism and proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
The approach forces him to explain why the action or inaction of the Government has contributed decisively to the Spanish leading the EU Kyoto breach.
What are the people responsible for the breach, in which sectors have they occurred and why his Government, the contract with the planet, has not prevented it.
In addition, it requires a clear explanation to the Spanish language of the measures needed to prevent the climate change.
What companies will be affected, which citizen habits will have to be changed, which individual and collective power savings will be required, what economic consequences will it have.
The question is who will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
There has no explanation.
In fact, someone will have to sacrifice and pay.
Climate change measures, the real measures, are unpopular.
Financially expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for companies and individuals.
The hundredth of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE close to the election may be dangerous to Zapatero, who has hesitantly denied it.
The one is to save the planet without doing anything, with pure propaganda, with no real consequences.
With interesting phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, this man who does not speak nor complain nor demand, but adorns rallies and inspires tenderness is very helpful for election campaigns.
Always, if the contract part is limited to being only virtual, and we only pretend to walk or stay cool with a fan.
Totana's mayor and the local Police head are being detained on a presumed plot of city-planning corruption
The Criminal Guard has detained the current mayor of Totana, "popular" Jose Martinez Andreo, the head of the local Police, the City Council secretary and a hostel businessman on possible city-planning crimes, sources have told us today.

What happens
1. 1.
If you feel it, we are going to leave the Book of the Month and see if in the meantime we have another Awardology and other competitions.
I am already sketching something.
Life is change, people.
If you have a proposal, you are invited to submit it.

The following commentary is from yesterday's Helsingin Sanomat, the most important Finnish newspaper (by way of head of the PISA report about education level in the world), which is a reference to what was published on November 18th, the same day in which Blackburn published the book:
The Philosophy signature has come to public attention as a result of the tragedy of Jokela School.
To blame for death, a high school student mentioned in his messages works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor and responsible for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, asked professors to adopt a critical attitude to Plato and affirmed that Nietzsche is not essential in the obligatory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.

A colleague has passed information on the introductory of downloading from the Internet:
A. The downloading of one song would be a criminal offence with a penalty of six months to a year.
If you steal from the music store for less than 400 euros, it is considered simply a misdemeanor(article 623,1).
A. If you steal from the store up to 1000 euros, theft is already crime, but the penalty continues to be inferior to the one imposed for downloading (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and you give it back 40 hours later, the penalty remains inferior to the one for downloading (article 244,1).
E. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of degraded music.
The participation in a big fight carries a penalty of three months to a year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years (article 154 of the Penal Code).
(article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to Article 184,2 of the Penal Code.

The attending doctor gave me an article on a rare investigation titled: "Money produces brain activity mainly if others receive less.
The feelings that are generated by the monthly wages of the workers depend on how much they work with their colleagues.
The study has been made using magnetic resonance at the University of Bonn, and the results have been published in the last issue of Science.
The hardest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed.
The investigators observed that when both guessed right and received the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one received double, the activation was greater.
I do not know if this conclusion required as much science.
The Balkan Public Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been eight years without a complaint against the Balkan war criminals from the public prosecutor's office of the Penal Court for the ex-Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
The mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with bittersweet flavour, because the responsible for Srebrenica's slaughter - where 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died, ex-general Ratko Mladic and ex-Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic are still in the spotlight.
Their names are in the list from which the Swiss documentary, produced by Marcel Schüpbach, takes its title, "Carla's list" (2006, not released in Spain), which has the pace of a police thriller, and follows the work of the Swiss public prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to prosecute the fleeing criminals and pressure the governments to strengthen the siege.
What insurance is good for me?
The car insurance that protects the driver against possible claims, is a major expense that would depend on many factors, such as age, sex, length of membership, marital status, type of vehicle to insure or the use of the latter, among others.
Automobile is only the beginning.
Because choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First we must be clear about what we are talking about.
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance agency and the insured.
This commitment is translated into an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company will receive the agreed premium and in return it is responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of loss.
The premium is the insurance price, which is determined based on various factors, such as age, sex, length of membership, marital status, type of vehicle to insure or the use of the latter, among others.
The insuring companies set their prices based on the statistics, so that the greater the probability of having an accident is, the higher the premium is.
It is therefore that both drivers older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that they have a smaller accident index due to their prudence.
Also, using the statistics, companies have reached the conclusion that married people tend to have less accidents than female drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with it the probability of having some type of mishap.
Frequency increases the probabilities.
There are many factors that the insurers consider when determining the premium price.
It is therefore important to study his situation to choose the insurance that best suits his profile.
The most important factors in choosing a particular type of insurance that, along with adapting to the individual’s characteristics, provides a reasonable price.
People younger than 25 years old have several disadvantages at the time of contracting an insurance at a reasonable price, such as reduced driving experience and the length of the membership.
Although, to be well insured, it is ideal to have a full comprehensive insurance, other economical options exist.
The most cautious drivers can choose a franchise with no risk, so that they get the insurance coverage but at a more feasible price.
This class of agreement would suppose that the client would cover a part of the costs in case of mishaps.
The amount of the costs that the client contributes will be based on the value of the premium, which will be higher if this amount is reduced.
Other options include an extended third party insurance, so that the client is guaranteed protection from damage caused to third parties, but not to his own car.
In addition, it would be covered for robbery, fire and loss of the vehicle.
An advice.
If you are younger than 25 years old try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, since this will be an advantage in future.
Advantages are reduced on the basic tariff of the company.
In contrast, a penalty is a surcharge on this base tariff.
"Advantages and penalties will depend on the company and its benefits.
If the company has had a good year it will increase the advantages ", says Noguera.
Once over 25 years of age drivers have a better time to get an insurance, since the accident index is reduced thanks to the experience.
The most recommended contract is fully comprehensive with tax exemption.
However, young people cannot take advantage of previous experience at the time of an accident or even when driving, according to the Director in Spain of the European company, who adds that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, after the "fear of the novice" goes away.
If the client is married but still has no children it is better to negotiate a comprehensive insurance, as long as his economic situation allows it.
On the other hand, people with children are considered as public with a high accident rate, which is why the premiums will be smaller.
In this case the best option is fully comprehensive insurance with tax exemption (this is 300 euros), or, if it is having high benefit level, a third party extended for the third life of the vehicle.
They make a more relaxed driver and have more spending power to allow the luxury to take a greater tax exemption.
For pensioners a full comprehensive insurance with tax exemption (being this one of 150 euros), or a third party if high level of advantage is achieved.
The important thing to mention is that the car insurance is a significant issue, not only because it protects the driver from possible accidents, but also because it represents an important cost, which is why it is essential to appropriately study the insurance that suits us most.
The Celtic are looking for a point worth eighth.
Milan and Celtic are playing on Tuesday at San Siro in search of the point they needed to achieve their respective goals in the Champions League, as Italians are used to be first and Scotland for his sentencing status.
The Italians added ten points and already certified in the fifth day pass with a tie in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points and still needs another to make sure that Shakhtar, with six, and Benfica, with four, do not overtake it.
The two Group D matches will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, when Milan will play in the World Clubs Championship in Japan, where they will play in the semi-finals in search of a place in the final on 16.
The group will close before the rest and Giuseppe Meazza seems to expect a tie, but the two teams will try to go for a win and Celtic know that winning is first and would ensure a better crossing into the quarter finals.
The Gordon Strachan team can serve even a defeat for classified Shakhtar if not wins, but may not be trusted because equality on nine points means that the Ukranians pass, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but won (2-0) in another live duel.
The Milanists are threatening to make it a bitter night for the Scots, who are looking for a second straight quarter-final place in the restructured Champions League after they were successfully defeated in the last round by a goal from Kaka in the extended time (1-0) after 0-0 in the round.
waiting for the victory of the "rossoneri" will be the Shakhtar, who will only have one win and Celtic will get into the quarters to continue in the European cup.
The last one and without any hope of staying in the top European competition, could reach third place with a victory, which plays UEFA.
20,000 people in Vancouver attending the first concert of the Spice Girls' tour.
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver (Canada), in front of 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they dissolved in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm), and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before the concert at the GM Place in Vancouver.
Around 20,000 people bought tickets to see the concert that included a video which tells the story of the group that was very successful at the end of 1990.
The reunion and world tour coincide with the release of a new album that includes their major hits, as well two new songs, "Headlines and Voodoo", published by EMI in Spain.
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage wearing bracelets that were given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the public that filled GM Place despite the fact that Victoria had forbidden it days earlier.
Before the show, Victoria Beckham reported that the British star has not seen our apparel for nothing, so I am nervous about what he will think about the show.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" led to the dissolution of the quintet two years later.
"I was scared".
"I was nervous to see that the world's sense has changed, the feeling about Spice Girls has changed.
Why not? I thought why not, so I am happy for having taken the decision.
The singer also added that over time, "things have resolved and we still love each other a lot."
Many things have changed since the Spice Girls acted together for the last time in 1998.
The group arrived in Vancouver in a special Virgin Airlines plane.
After their arrival at the airport, waiting for them was an army of nannies.
Five children joined.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will travel to California (USA), San Jose (December 4th and 7th).
In Madrid they will appear on December 23th.
New Russia-Ukraine gas row fears
The new gas price dispute is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, raising the risk that Russian exports of the fuel to western Europe may be affected.
Most of Russia's gas exports to the European Union (EU) are piped through Ukraine and any row between the two countries is watched closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price it has to pay for gas it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two last year reduced EU supplies.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, try to agree on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more as it has agreed to pay up to 50% extra in 2008 for gas it sourced from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine having to pay 40% more for its imports from Gazprom.
'We need to use our arguments as one of the top gas transit states in the talks'.
The changes in gas prices should be linked to our arguments about the levels of transit fees to western Europe via Ukraine.
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev saw Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
The result was a knock-on fall in exports to western Europe, which sharply pushed prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of European Union's supplies.
Russia has the world's largest gas stocks, but much of it is under-developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS must check foreign workers
Scottish NHS boards need to improve criminal records checks for employees outside Europe, a watchdog has said.
The recommendation from Auditor General Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was linked to the June airport attack.
Black also raised concerns that NHS Scotland had no accurate picture of the number of overseas staff it had.
The report pointed out other key checks were properly carried out across a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor looked at recruiting staff outside European Economic Area countries, after the Glasgow Airport attack.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a Jeep was driven into the main terminal building.
The doctor was one of three doctors who appeared at the Old Bailey by video link in October, charged in connection with the suspected car bomb attempts in the UK.
NHS boards are expected to conduct pre-employment checks on overseas staff to ensure they have the qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although Scots health boards use Disclosure Scotland to perform criminal records checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain such information outside Britain.
The auditor general's report has now advised that the board should take on Criminal Records Bureau guidance, which helps employers with checks in several countries.
Although some of the personnel records had evidence of these checks, this is not routinely done.
The report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure accurate information on the number of overseas NHS staff.
British Medical Association Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who may commit future terrorist acts.
The report suggests that current pre-employment checks are working well in NHS Scotland and it is unclear what added value the recommendations will deliver.
Scotland health authorities have currently 1,161 overseas staff, mostly doctors and nurses.
The auditor general warned the number could be higher, partly because boards had difficulty identifying which staff were on indefinite leave to stay.
The investigation also found that established check procedures at NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were largely being followed.
These included passport, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and guidance on pre-employment checks for overseas staff in the NHS.
Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was keen to have this work carried out in the wake of the terror attack on Glasgow Airport.
The report added that the Scottish Government, in collaboration with health boards, would consider the recommendations of the report and ensure best practice was reflected in updated guidance on pre-employment checks for all staff - including those from overseas.
Joy Division dominate film awards
Control, the biopic about late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has scooped five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including best film.
Trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in warehouse until he was cast as Curtis, and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Judi Dench was named best actress for thriller Notes On A Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety award for putting British films under the international spotlight.
The prizes were handed out at a ceremony at London's Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise with Joy Division from his death in 1980, aged 23.
The film - which features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order on the soundtrack - was shot for just £3m.
The award also awarded Dutch photographer Corbijn, previously best known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, for best director and best debut director.
The award was also awarded to Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer, who took the Best Documentary award.
The best actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver to a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, received the Richard Harris Award for outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones sequel The Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
The doors were opened for people like me, which were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a couple times.
The guy is my type of guy, a great actor of the time, I am really honoured.
The independent film awards, known as the Bifas, are selected by a panel of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 over terror plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for involvement in cells planning an immediate attack on an oil installation, as well as attacks on clerics and security forces.
The World's biggest oil exporter reported that one of the cells was planning to smuggle in missiles.
Loyalists to al-Qaeda have been fighting the monarchy, an American ally, since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
The group of eight militants led by a foreign resident planned an attack on an oil facility in the Eastern Province, the TV report said.
Saudi Arabia has been building a 35,000-strong rapid response force to protect installations after a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006 on the world's largest oil processing plant, at Abqaiq.
The report, cited an interior ministry statement, said 18 of the arrested belong to a "expert in launching missiles" who had slipped into the country.
It said the militants planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
Other 22 of those detained were reported to be plotting to assassinate clerics and security forces.
The government has asked clerics to do more to prevent Saudis heading to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting Allied forces and US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by hardline Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militants believe many clerics in Saudi Arabia as being co-opted by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates government.
Military - fueled by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi born al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-western Saudi government - have targeted foreign residential compounds, government buildings and energy-sector installations.
This was a very large effort by security forces over the past five months.
The arrests also included a "media cell" of 16 in Medina, which aimed at promoting "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
The arrested also include 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
Venus climate may be a window into future for Earth
Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
The planet is even more like a wayward twin of Earth than was previously thought.
Venus is Earth's close planetary neighbor.
The two worlds are about the same size and occupy similar orbits, but Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have had conditions similar to those on Earth and may even have been habitable, scientists now believe.
The runaway carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and a slower rotation rate sent Venus to a different development path.
Today the planet is stripped of water, has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead and is threatened by Hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a sobering view of how Earth might develop given severe climate change.
The mission leaders of Venus Express, Professor Fred Taylor of Oxford University's department of physics, a member of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from the Earth when the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
The new data allow us to construct a scenario in which Venus started out like the Earth, possibly with a habitable environment, billions of years ago.
'Enriched uranium' seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reported to be enriched with uranium, was seized by Slovak and Hungary police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people have been arrested and the material was examined.
The scientist would not confirm if it was enriched uranium but would have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Still wide open
Mitt Romney said he did not feel it was dignified for candidate to ask questions from a snowman.
The Republican candidates for the presidency eventually agreed to face a YouTube debate, in which ordinary voters recorded questions on video and sent them to the candidates.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday November 28th were quite as ridiculous as the snowman who asked Republicans about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
The questions, answers, this time, shed much light on the state of the Republican party ahead of the next election.
The producers of CNN, which co-sponsored the debate, chose which YouTube clips to show to the aspiring candidates.
The first half hour of the debate, the longest dedicated to any single issue, focuses on immigration.
The subject is one of the most potent topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn up a dial when the candidates talked tough on borders.
The most harsh and long exchange of the evening was between Giuliani, the national frontrunner, and Mr Romney, who has already moved ahead in the crucial early polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani is trying to shake his reputation that he was easy on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
The former Massachusetts governor attacked Mr Romney, accusing him of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his house.
The two clashed particularly when questioners asked if any candidate would support "amnesty" (giving illegal immigrants a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Candidates like Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to get in on the subject.
No man has a prayer at the nomination, but both remain in the race probably because they started fighting the immigration drum earlier and harder than others.
At least on immigration the candidates, broadly, share the same views: tougher borders, intolerance for illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears of toxic toys from China or other outside concerns, helps Republicans forget or minimise the divisions between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
The debate started to get awkward when other topics were raised.
Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed waterboarding as torture.
One questioner asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
The Bible was his favourite book, but he might not believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Other questioner asked if Jesus would support death penalty.
Senator Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, in first place in a recent poll from Iowa thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism - said that death penalty was painful but necessary.
If Jesus was in favour, he laughed, adding that he was too smart to run for office.
The race remains unusually wide open.
Senator Huckabee's surge in Iowa coincides with the libertarian Ron Paul recent fundraising feats and his hooting cheers at Wednesday's debate.
The two have started from the bottom because the two wings cannot yet agree on one of the better known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness and winks to both party wings.
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
Pains in work
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another hole to fall into; his way out of it remains the same.
As British politics go, this one is not particularly juicy.
No honours seem to have been sold, no politician's Paris hotel bills picked up, no extra-marital toes swollen.
The revelation that a rich businessman disguised his contributions to the Labour Party of more than £650,000 ($1.3m) over four years under other people's names, and that the party failed to report it is one that the eminent Gordon Brown could have done without.
The expectation was that he would provide a strong, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats' increasingly witty stand-in leader, Mr Brown has changed from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The cack-handed rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Thought-out proposals to change the tax code have gathered business groups together against the government.
The loss of 25m people's personal details revealed unimaginable administrative bungling.
The trio of retired generals launched a mutiny in the Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: being a military minister is, they claim, a part-time job.
The multifaceted donations from David Abrahams, Labour's general secretary (and previous head of compliance) have already resigned.
None of this means that Mr Brown is irrevocably headed for the exit.
It can reach a tipping point after which they find it impossible to govern.
People do not like nor trust politicians, but usually withdraw their disbelief when a new lot takes over.
Once it seems clear that a Prime Minister is unlikely to improve things, and may not be around for long, the civil service starts leaking; cabinet ministers start briefing; the press searches for bad news; and government becomes defensive and unfocused.
In one way, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot claim to be a new broom.
Though he would like to disown Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax-authority records are linked to decisions Mr Brown made as Secretary of the Exchequer.
If he was not directly involved in Blairish mishaps - such as the long "cash for peerages investigation into political-party funding - voters may assume he was.
The situation is not as bad as it looks.
The mistakes are not as appalling as the Tories are making out.
As with Mr Bean, no one has died or been swindled outright.
The remedy, painful though it may be, is to provide reliable, sound and sometimes brutal government.
The new fuss about political donations is a good example.
The Garboesque Mr Abrahams, who compares his donations to his charitable giving, says he wished no public recognition for his giving.
It may be so, but the decision was not his to make.
The laws against anonymity for big political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public is entitled to know who may be buying access to those who rule the land.
The lawyer, who says he knew of the arrangement but does not believe it was illegal, will face close questioning.
The evidence is that Mr Brown is not involved, although the majority of the payments were made after he took office in June.
The Prime Minister has done half of the job.
The committee was quick to condemn the breach of law, but he diluted that confidence by reaching for a familiar tool, a committee of investigation into the matter - led by a retired bishop and a judge.
This case, the "lessons to be learned" are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
Beyond that, there are other things that Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent Committee on Public Health Standards, which has been without one for six months, and pressing ahead with genuine reform of political-party funding.
The latter would require hard-up Labour to co-operate with the Tories and possibly give up its special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to get back voters; and only one way he can secure a victory is through unimpeachable probity and solid competence.
Cardsharks
The subprime mortgage crisis is infecting America's credit card market?
When blood is in water, it is natural that dorsal fins swirl excitedly.
The housing market is aging, and players are looking at the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that credit card losses could reach $$99 billion if contagion spreads from subprime mortgages to other consumer credit.
Symptoms of strain are clearly visible.
The increase in both the charge-off and delinquency rates is measured by the share of balances that are uncollectible or more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it had taken a $1.4 billion charge in its American consumer-finance business, mainly because of weakness among card borrowers.
It is too early to panic, though.
Charges and damages are still low.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third quarter delinquency rate of 3.89% was almost half of the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
The change in America's personal-bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to a sudden decline in bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a large chunk of credit card losses.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month.
And confidence in credit-card asset-backed securities is pretty firm despite paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that issuance volumes for 2007 will end up being 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection between subprime-mortgage crisis and the credit-card market are certainly present: consumers are likely to load up on credit-card debt now that home-equity loans are drying up.
The card issuers look at cash flow rather than asset values, so falling house prices do not necessarily cause a change in borrowers' creditworthiness.
They may even work to issuers' advantage.
The incentives for consumers to keep paying the mortgage decrease if properties are less than the value of the loan; card debt rises up on the list of repayment priorities.
However, card issuers are also able to respond much quicker and flexibly to stormy conditions than mortgage lenders, by changing interest rates or altering credit limits.
It theoretically reduces the risk of rapid repricing of assets.
Gary Perlin, Capital One's chief financial Officer.
If a sudden subprime-style meltdown in credit-card market is unlikely, sustained downturn is much more real.
If lower house prices and a contraction in credit push America into recession, the industry will probably face a harsher future.
Keep watching for those dorsal fins.
British Bankers Trialed in Enron Case
Three British bankers who were set to go to trial for their role in a fraudulent scheme with former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow have changed their pleas to guilty Wednesday.
David Beringham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent to seven counts of wire fraud for allegedly colluding with Fastow in a secret financial scam in 2000.
The two were set to go on trial in January.
The two parties each pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.
The three former executives at Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became a cause for worldwide recognition throughout extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, the case is a loose end of an investigation launched after Enron's 2001 collapse.
Initial charges against them in 2002 alerted Fastow that he was a target of the government's investigation into Enron's downfall.
The indictment against the bankers is called the "NatWest Three" and alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to prepare a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top aide Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of fraudulent Enron schemes that helped drive the plunge into bankruptcy.
The bank had valued its interest in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew it had significant value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the bank's interest in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in this company.
The indictment states that Fastow falsely represented to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
The $20 million actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers got $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others skimmed about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was found guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three year, one month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three British men have been free on $1 million bonds that required them to live in the United States pending trial.
Enron, once the seventh-largest company, collapsed in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions of debt or make failing ventures look profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension plans.
Kenneth Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their role in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were wiped out after he died of heart disease last year.
Not Down and Out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 airplane, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles starts at $54 million.
It is small change to some Russian rich.
The Gulfstream passengers can seat up to 18 people, according to Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
However, none of them ask for that many seats because it is for a private family or a company president.
The Gulfstream booth was taken up last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day orgie of conspicuous consumption held in a huge exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital.
Gulfstream also set up display stands, aiming to attract newly moneyed Russians in everything from luxury yachts to diamond-encrusted cars worth 50 Cent.
Mr Firer smirked as he looked at a bright orange Porsche at the booth next to him.
The car is a nice car, but it is nickels and dimes compared to us.
After the United States, Russia is the second biggest market for private aircraft.
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be as wealthy as Dallas was in its heyday.
The same thing happened in 1890s when Americans become wealthy and moved to Europe, where they were viewed as materialistic.
Like Saudi high rollers of 1970s and Japanese in 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world's most visible free spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are seeking their share of the Klondike.
The same event in Moscow this week has drawn Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods to Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-tier rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires who together collectively worth $670 billion, according to a study by economists at the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a think tank here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below subsistence level.)

The first event was held in collaboration with the brand's Russian distributor, Soho Jewelry Group.
The women are all impeccably groomed and the men are all worth a fortune.
Walking the halls Sunday night, dressed in evening attire, two real estate agents, Evgeniya Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described both themselves and their clients as millionaires.
'I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche', she added.
The fair was mainly aimed at the new riches, the type of Russian shoppers who would be willing to walk through a warehouse that showcased Lamborghinis, platinum penknives, custom pool tables, Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
General public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
Moscow citizens are interested in learning what is the most expensive and best, according to Mr Gijrath, who was sitting in front of a wall-size re-creation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue tile.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in bling-bling."
In fact, vendors here have already moved on from flashy logos to the kind of understated limited-edition brands that would not be marketed at a trade show.
However, several thousand people, whether cash millionaires, millionaires, or just tourists, gathered in the halls every day.
And some of them were buying.
The first night of the show, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds here, reportedly sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that outfits high-end cars with high-level alarm systems, reported that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three car grilles, resembling interlinked chain bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, for $55,000 each.
The reporter showed a car wheel, designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had encrusted with coloured Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a set of four.
The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconia, is not going to drive on those wheels.
"He is going to keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
If many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr Karapetian says the phrase "Russian millionaire" is not exclusive at the moment, due to the rise in real estate prices.
If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if not in cash.
"There are more than you think."
The wealthy could at least pretend to be rich at the stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company had built four red British-style telephone booths, stuffed with piles of counterfeit million dollar greenbacks.
Asad Karyev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to throw money around, ask friends to snap selfies of them sitting in a replacement wealth, or just to pocket a couple million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel himself a millionaire," Mr Karryev said.
Botched Surgery suspected in New Jersey death
The day before Thanksgiving Ronald Livingston looked through the large plate-glass window of Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance pulled into the white Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon, there was a police patrol car.
And then there was another.
Then I saw the medical examiner's van pull up, Mr Livingston, a supervisor at the restaurant, said on Wednesday.
"That's when I knew somebody was gone."
The authorities would learn that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an Executive Assistant to the Director of Newark Police Department.
The police are trying to determine whether she died from a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, whom the police do not identify, working in the house at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicology tests, which may not be available for weeks, will help solve a mysterious death that has sent a spasm of grief through the top ranks of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police Director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
Loyal, hard working and steady, Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She would protect me.
According to Mr. McCarthy, Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Beverage Control Commission, and she left two children, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said that they were trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unlicensed surgery.
The possibility of a vaccine is one of the possibilities, she added.
It is an ongoing investigation.
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 p.m. on Nov.
21 and found Mrs Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead at the scene.
More than a week has gone by, and the authorities have not given any information about their investigation or about the owner of the house, who is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh would not say whether Ms. Castro was interviewed by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical office.
The door was closed at Ms. Castro's home, where a swollen rosebush stood in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
The blue drum labelled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume - was kept in a carport, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks off to one side.
When he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate his new city's isolation and rough-hewn political culture.
"She would say, 'Watch out for this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I got here, and she was always here when I left.
It was a shame.
Fed will cut rates lead to world stock market surge
shares rose on both sides of the Atlantic after markets hoped that the Federal Reserve will try to calm credit conditions with further interest rate cuts were boosted by soothing comments from the US central bank's vice-chairman.
Financial markets soared in London, New York and Europe after Donald Kohn, No 2 to Ben Bernanke, the Fed Chairman, stressed that policymakers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to continued stress in financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure fretful markets amid resurgent credit strains, Mr Kohn said recent turbulence "partly reversed some of the improvement in market functioning over the late part of September and in October".
Should the elevated turbulence continue, it would increase the possibility of further tightening in financial conditions for households and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the Fed is ready to step in with fresh injections of capital into US markets, and possible further interest rate cuts to stabilise credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid more bad news on the US economy, as US homes hit record low in October.
The fallout from financial turmoil was emphasized by an announcement from Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it will cut 650 jobs, or 4 per cent of its global workforce, in a cost-cutting round to cover heavy losses from its losing bets on US sub-prime home loans.
Only 20 of those posts are expected to go to London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55 per cent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 per cent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent to close at 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of UK blue-chip companies.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6 per cent, and France's CAC40 was up 2.3 per cent.
The re-emerging of credit stress in the markets was acknowledged after a three-month auction of three-month funds by the European Central Bank saw loans to European commercial banks at a high rate since April 2001.
The Bank of England pressed to follow the Fed and ECB and inject extra money into London money markets as credit strains continued to increase as three-month "Libor" rates for lending between UK banks reached their highest since late September, at 6.59 per cent, after steady climb since November 12.
England faces judgment call over the claims of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who should bat at No 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
The question is, no less relevant in the wider context than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the Chairman of selectors, is here to help Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide and Hugh Morris, the England managing director, is starting to fill the desk of Hugh Morris, the England managing director, to help Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide and because the desk of Hugh Morris, the England managing director, is starting to fill with applications to be national selector, if not a full-time one.
The person who does not get the sixth batting place will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is often unfair.
The answer is never easy to pin down what makes one man reach the top of his profession while another never reaches a lower level, sometimes for luck rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, requiring judgment that always requires subjective judgment.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same might be asked in another field of whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both bright young executives with good degrees in business, should be promoted to the Board: only one of them is appointed.
Who can tell what the right level is for a cricketer unless he is given the chance to sink or swim at the next one?
Figures naturally have a large influence on decisions, but so do opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the right eye if he is to take a wicket and a batsman has to get regular chances up the order if he is to make an impact as a one-day cricketer.
The eyes of the selectors are more complicated.
There were many who played better last season, such as James Anderson, who looks certain to play in the first Test if Stephen Harmison declares his ability and bowls like the wind in the net.
Anderson took 32 first class wickets at 33 runs each to earn a place on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same modest average, but both have had their moments at the highest level and wish for more.
Shah or Bopara play at Asgiriya Stadium is only a matter of opinion.
The choice may break or make both men's career, or it might make little difference.
The first two years of the series, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but Paul Collingwood, struggling to develop himself, took the first two with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but despite a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is still underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a more intensive discussion in the wake of today's net session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and favour Shah's higher experience over Bopara's younger youthfulness.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah's favour are his sparkling and valuable debut Test innings of 88 in Bombay, 32 first class hundreds to only six by Bopara, who is at 22, seven years younger than he is, and an excellent record against spin bowling.
The lack of confidence in his batting in May against West Indies in the Test at Lord's, his home venue as a Middlesex player, seems to have taken away some of the confidence that was evident in the two innings in May against West Indies in the Test at Lord's, his home venue as a Middlesex player.
The Essex all-rounder has a few pounds of life.
The attitude on the field is almost nothing for him on a cricket field and his attitude off it was summed up when he recently overturned a four-wheel drive vehicle at an exhibition for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
However, he took out his Vodafone and called Alastair Cook, his team-mate, to say, with excitement, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is much better fielder, bowling his skiddy medium pace to some effect here on pitches that seem to suit him and batting with confidence and skill.
The right man is one thing, the right moment another.
Perhaps that is the real art of selection.
The inclination is to give Bopara his chance now, which is not to say that Shah might not excel if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring the refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria started arriving in Baghdad yesterday, sending out exiles who had run out of cash or extensions and others who hoped that the city was returning to normality.
Some even returned to fight the militants who took them from their homes.
Mansour bus station, even before the arrival from Damascus of 800 people in an official government convoy of dozens buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
Sabah al Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor, said.
"I return today because of what I saw on TV and what I keep reading in the newspapers about what happened to Baghdad and how it was safe now.
The Mahdi army stopped killing people, he said, referring to the Shia militia of militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to stand down for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he was unable to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
Their neighbours in Amariyah telephoned to tell him that a US-backed military force had helped drive al-Qaeda out of their base in the west of the capital, and asked him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who was driven from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after he called for their unity to fight al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
Then two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they have started an anti-al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and they need my and my boys' support.
The way I returned today was Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62, who was 62.
Many spoke of being tempted by the increase in calm in the capital since the US troop surge and the growth of local "concerned citizens groups" armed and working with the US military to defend their neighbourhoods.
More reported on being forced home by immigration problems and a weakened capital in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, spoke to common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian Government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two half million people are believed to have fled the country's sectarian death squads.
Since al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the Government to stop giving Iraqis visas, we were OK until al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the Government to stop giving them visas to force them to return to Iraq.
"I cannot trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
The reason for the drop in violence is that Sunnis have been taken out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating many places where tensions are low.
The fear is that a sudden flood of refugees will further raise ethnic tensions and lead to fighting.
Small Saarland, Good Education
The smallest German federal state is leading the field in vocational training, and distinguishes itself by its international character of its university-level institutions in particular.
In one field of education, Saarland citizens are affected by the same shortcomings as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday I met someone not from Saarland, and I had to point out for the 50th time that we are not Frenchmen" - with this self-deprecating advertising slogan, the smallest German federal state celebrates its 50th birthday.
The same time, France and Luxemburg play major roles in Saarland's education system, which, according to a so-called education monitor of the German Business Institute (IW), Cologne, ranks fifth.
The university level institutions' cooperation with the neighboring countries is a tradition.
Saarbrücken University was founded by the French in 1948.
Even now, students have the opportunity to obtain bi-national or even tri-national degrees.
The share of foreign students is large, making up 15.6 percent of the total.
However, the number of Saarland-born students is also above average at the state's university-level institutions, but many of those students do not have a diploma from a college-preparing high school.
In Saarland, many people use the vocational education system, says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than every fifth adolescent acquires their high-education entrance qualification at a vocational school, which places Saarland above the federal average by more than seven percentage points.
Opportunities to mix vocational and academic education are comparatively strong.
Relative to population, the supply of combined vocational and academic studies ranks second in Germany.
Although practice-oriented education and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
The following steps are taken by Saarland’s Department of Education to promote engineering sciences.
After the first PISA survey, we initiated a number of reforms at general-education schools, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education says.
Examples include the government introduced statewide comparative tests.
In order for children to start studying earlier, the final year at day-care centres is free of charge – a model that other German federal states have begun adopting.
The students’ performance has substantially improved, future comparative surveys will show.
The 2003 PISA survey showed the share of at risk students shrinking from 29 to 20 percent.
Saarland was not improved much as other German federal states.
Bavarians are better at mathematics.
The harshness of Saarlanders is that PISA does not evaluate foreign language skills – a area in which they might score.
Because neighbouring languages are mandatory at college-prep high schools - even though Saarlanders are not Frenchmen.
Chávez Turns Back Clocks
Venezuela is about to change.
Chávez has decreed that time-pieces in South America will be turned back by half an hour on December 9.
In Spain, Chávez is becoming a figure of ridiculousness.
The official Gazette of Venezuela says that clocks must be set to GMT minus four and half hours.
The South American state creates its own time zone that is not applicable to any other country in the world.
Chávez, who has been hostile to the US, cited several reasons for his decision.
Then on Wednesday (local time), Chávez announced a severance of diplomatic relations with Colombia due to a hostage crisis.
As long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, the left-wing nationalist said, he would not have relations with Colombia’s head of state or with its government.
'My dignity is not allowing it', Chávez said.
The reform would provide a significant extension of his domestic power.
The dispute was caused by Uribe’s decision to revoke Chávez’s mandate to deal with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe’s decision was a “slap in the face” for Venezuela, Chávez said on Sunday.
Chávez is the talk of the town in Spain, too.
Another new ringtone for cell phones is causing a rash in the country: “Why do you shut your mouth” (Why do you shut your mouth) is the line that more than half of the people have downloaded from the Internet.
It was a speech from King Juan Carlos of Spain. Shocked by the persistent interjections, Juan Carlos had rebuked him at the recent Ibero-American Summit.
German Wages Feared to Fall in 2007
Although Germany has a strong economy, wage earners in Germany are expected to fear a drop in actual wage in 2007, projections say.
Experts cite several reasons for their pessimistic projections.
The Hans Böckler Foundation estimates that employees could face a lower wage in 2007, compared to the previous year.
The main causes are a modest wage growth, value-added tax increase and food and energy prices,Horn told the daily newspaper "Bild."
Additionally, new burdens may emerge for wage-earners in the unemployment insurance contribution.
Lowering the unemployment insurance contribution to 3.3 percent at the end of the year was appropriate and reasonable in the present situation, Treasury Secretary Peer Steinbrück told the daily newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung."
The Social Democrat reportedly also said that the Federal Employment Office should not ask for federal loans or grants again.
The discovery of exploding prices for food and petroleum products resulted in the highest inflation rate in 13 years.
Overall, there was a year-on-year price increase of 3.0 percent.
Venus Is Earth's Hellish Twin
Although its hostile atmosphere is more similar to Earth than expected, European space probe "Venus Express"discovered lightning in the atmosphere and whirlwinds at the poles, similar to those occurring on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists suspected the existence of lightning on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" brings confirmation – it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: On Venus, lightning is leaping from cloud to cloud in a height of 56 kilometres, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles in the science magazine Nature.
The famous "primordial soup theory" believes that life on Earth was conditioned by lightning: Supposedly, thunderstorms prompted reactions in the ocean, which in turn led to the creation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
However, if life ever existed on Venus, it must have been in the very early history of the planet.
Today, life on Venus surface is very low: The atmosphere is about one hundred times dense than on Earth, with temperatures up to 500 degrees.
Venus may be a devilish twin of Earth, but a twin it is.
The key question of the ESA mission is why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has undergone such a fundamental evolution.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 marked a major milestone for Venus research. There had been no specific probe to explore the planet since the late nineties.
The latest research results are now being presented in several "Nature" articles.
These also show that the similarities between our neighboring planet and Earth are greater than initially thought.
In addition to the known whirlwind at the North Pole, researchers discovered a whirl of clouds at the South Pole, spinning at a significantly higher speed.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in Earth’s winter hemisphere, says a research team from the Italian Institute of Space Physics and Cosmology.
The mass of the second-innermost planet is almost the same as that of Earth, as is its diameter, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres.
The planet, also known as morning star or evening star, orbits the sun in about 225 days.
The Venus rotation is much slower than Earth’s.
With surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, Venus does not look like Earth.
Both planets accumulated water. On Earth it remained in oceans, while on Venus it escaped into space.
The bulk of the atmosphere is concentrated in carbonate rock, and on Venus it makes up the bulk of the atmosphere.
Köhler Defends Merkel’s Meeting with Dalai Lama
Deutsche Federal President Köhler is demanding an end to the party dispute on the Dalai Lama’s formal reception at the Federal Chancellery.
The Socialist Party was indirectly criticised for its attacks on the chancellor after September’s meeting.
The threat to Germany’s reputation, Germany’s Federal President Horst Köhler asked the grand coalition to end its dispute on the Dalai Lama’s formal reception.
However, we should not face the world as a nation divided on this issue,"Köhler told the trade journal "Handelsblatt."
However, Köhler reiterated his appreciation of the Dalai Lama’s formal reception by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, a Christian Democrat, in September.
Human rights are universal, even though I respect the diversity of cultures.
The President stressed that everyone was aware of Germany’s obligation to maintain balances in international affairs.
The Chancellor has not changed from our traditional policy to China.
China is aware of this, too,"Köhler said.
Secretary of State Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a Social Democrat, had indirectly expressed displeasure at the formal reception, leading to attacks from the Christian Democratic Union.
Also, Steinmeier had criticised the Union’s "showcasementality in foreign affairs."
The Dalai Lama’s formal reception at the Federal Chancellery was a major issue in German-Chinese relations.
The Chinese government not only cancelled the visit to German Treasury Secretary Peer Steinbrück, a Social Democrat, but also suspended the so-called strategically dialogue between the two countries’ State Departments.
China’s head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked Germany Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to agree to the Dalai Lama’s formal reception.
While rejecting European officials receiving the spiritual leader of Tibetans, Wen Jiabao underlined China’s position.
The Dalai Lama’s actions and words showed his intention to separate Tibet and the broader Tibetan region from China, Wen Jiabao said.
Schäble Warns of "French" riots in Germany
Attacks with police, shot shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots like those in France.
The necessary steps to prevent social discontent in Germany from escalating in public displays of violence are needed, the German Federal Secretary of Interior asked.
In the wake of the massive youth riots in France, German Federal Interior Secretary Wolfgang Schäuble of the Christian Democratic Union fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must prevent the rise of social tensions that may escalate into violence.
The threat to the safety of the prisoners is serious, he told the Hannover-based daily newspaper "Neue Presse."
Some young adults were finding it difficult to adapt to a social reality that is changing ever more quickly, he said.
Federal, state and local governments are already working on the issues, Schäuble added.
These were not limited to integration of migrant workers, he added.
"Between the German Summit for Integration and the German-Islamic Affairs Conference we are beginning to see results."
It was too early to sound all clear, he said.
The same time, Schäuble pointed to the fact that German suburbs were not suffering from the same urban-construction and social issues as their French counterparts.
In neighbourhoods north of Paris, violence has been reported between young people and the police in recent nights.
Automobile and public buildings were also destroyed in Toulouse.
Kenan Kolat, Chairman of the Community of Turks in Germany, is asking the German Federal Government to step up its integration efforts.
In light of the riots in France, Kolat warned of "copycat effects."
Germany was not as urgent as France, he added.
There was still a need for action.
The unemployment rate among young people with migrational background below the age of 25 was "above average,"Kolat noted.
More vocational training positions are needed.
Youth needs options, Kolat stressed.
The Chairman of the Turk Community added that "social supervision in families" was more effective than in France.
In addition, many young people did not want to destroy what their parents had built for them in Germany, he said.
"We still need to be careful,"Kolat advised.
Youths needed to be "given the opportunity to participate in labour and education."
In Parisian suburb Villiers le Bel, the night remained quiet.
The area was surrounded by hundreds of police officers, and a helicopter circled the area with searchlights.
The responsible authorities report three arrests and a number of burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the day before, a security force of 1000 has been keeping the peace.
After visiting the suburb, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced that police crackdowns would continue as long as needed.
During the night of Monday, about 80 policemen were harmed in riots.
In the following night, the unrest spread to Toulouse.
The riots were ignited by a traffic accident that caused the death of two young people on Sunday.
The initial investigation by the Office of the District Attorney found that the police were not responsible for the death of the two young men.
In the Sky Angela’s Realm
The performance of the Chancellor shows that the coalition is at the end of its rope conceptually – and that herself must be scaled down to zero.
What country do the Federal Chancellor live in?
After her poor performance at the general debate, which was cloddy and without substance, the verdict is: not this one – not in the country she should be governing.
The charge that she concentrated too much on foreign affairs was dismissed with a terribly presumptive statement.
It was provincial, she said, which shows her lack of understanding the critics’ meaning.
At the Bundestag, she documented, in plainsight, how right on target they are.
No tangible concern for, nor any sense of the country’s issues can be detected.
Instead, she presented herself as Angela in the Sky: a detached politician who takes refuge in international affairs but remains noncommitted even there.
Climate protection: She excessively blows her own horn on the resolutions of Heiligendamm, but does not share how climate protection is achieved in this country.
The self-praise – two years ago, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union would have denied herself this much modesty.
Now she is holding on to the slogan that the economic boom has reached people’s doorsteps.
In doing so, she damages her reputation as a pragmatist who solves problems, instead of sugarcoating the truth.
In the realm of Angela in the Sky domestic issues are marginally important.
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage earners?
A few asides are all she has time for on that.
It is telling how often she misdoes with children’s allowance.
At this point in her address, Merkel needs three attempts to produce a reasonable serviceable sentence.
As things get concrete, she stumbles as if on unfamiliar ground.
Attack Department
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough exchange of blows – and now have to fear an underdog.
The candidates’ tension is finding release as early as the first subject.
Mitt Romney accuses his fellow Republican Rudy Giuliani of turning New York into a "safe haven for illegal immigrants."
The latter counters with bold claims: "I would say his home was a safe haven for illegals,"Giuliani says.
The candidates start the attack: Because the Republican base still lacks a clear candidate, the eight candidates use the CNN debate as the first and most important tool to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30-second videos uploaded via YouTube by internet users are nothing more than cues.
The same isolationism that allowed Hitler to rise to power,John McCain accuses his fellow Ron Paul, the only one in the group demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
However, Romney is also harshly reprimanded by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to denounce waterboarding, a simulation of drowning, as torture.
However, audience reactions in St Petersburg, Florida, show that the main issues of the campaign are far off from the Iraq War and the torture debates.
When conservative values are praised and the notion of future tax increases is rejected, the auditorium is abuzzed.
Then, the two favourites’ weaknesses once more become apparent.
"I was wrong back then," a remorseful Romney announces, apologizing to base and audience for endorsing abortion as recently as 1994.
Giuliani faltered when asked about his opinion on taking the Bible literally.
Musharraf Begins First Civilian Reign
One day after resigning as army chief, Pakistani ruler Musharraf was appointed as president.
Then eight years of military rule in Pakistan ended.
The President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five years in office.
The ceremony at the President’s Palace in the capital Islamabad was live on Pakistani television.
Musharraf promise to honor the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
The appointment of the army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani was arising from international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now takes up the throne as a civilian head of state.
By stepping down as the Chief of the Army, Musharraf had fulfilled one of the key demands of the opposition and of the West.
ending the state of emergency, which Musharraf declared on November 3, is another central demand.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will revoke the emergency state soon after being sworn in, meeting one of the West’s demands.
The country’s supreme court overruled all objections to Musharraf’s re-election on October 6.
In the northern Tribal Area of North Waziristan, four soldiers were killed and four more were injured in an attack on a military convoy.
The bomb exploded on a road near the Afghanistan border.
The Fathers of Krautrock Are Back
Another group of the seventies is reunited: At a concert in Berlin, the three band members of Harmonia once again grabbed their mixing consoles.
The reunion is celebrated with a release of "Live 1974," a record from their heyday.
Even back then, they were much more famous abroad than in Germany.
The arranged sensation then occurs in the form of three composed men at the table.
Every person has his little box in front of them, his wires and most importantly, his key.
The elder Dieter Moebius, 63, wearing a pristine white shirt, is throning at the centre.
At his left flank is Michael Rother, a slender 57 with a laptop computer and guitar.
The left, from the auditorium’s perspective, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is sitting on a mixing console in concentration.
Every one is contributing noises, sometimes even a beat.
In some cases, it sometimes fuses into a conventional piece of music.
The gentlemen themselves do not seem overly bothered when it does.
Harmonia’s reunion has caused some excitement among Krautrock aficionados.
Although, it may be disclosed here:
Why should Germans not be allowed to celebrate their living legends from the seventies?
Because it is misleadingly called Krautrock has always been held in more enthusiasm in England or America than in home.
The music industry gave an Echo Honorary Award to survivors of Cologne group Can in 2003, many quizzical German pop faces were to be seen in the room.
The Red Hot Chili Peppers started to thank the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their panegyric, the sadness knew no bounds.
Then, Michael Rother took the stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, like a old friend.
The problem with ignorance at home and a misty-eyed view abroad is one thing.
Harmonia overtaxes the brain for the simple reason that the trio only existed for two years, making much less impression than some would attest in hindsight.
Moebius and Roedelius have previously collaborated with artist Conrad Schnitzler, under the promise of Cluster.
Initially they performed in the basement of the Schaubühne in Berlin.
After that for economic reasons for a record label owned by the church in Düsseldorf.
Rother was briefly helping out Kraftwerk, and later become a guitarist with Neu!, at the time the most radical German group.
Around 1973, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile, to Forst, in the Weser Highland.
There, at Alte Weserhof, an old ruin dating to the 16th century, they lived as communards, away from the city.
Less ideologically than at Kommune I, where Roedelius had previously worked as a nanny.
However, living the Spitzwegian life of an artist.
The banneret of the Glee Club Harmonia Ottenstein was found among scrap, and thus, a name for their art.
It was documented by Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia," the next one "De Luxe."
Because, as relaxed and modest as the music may sound, the band was in great need, materially.
The brushwood collecting was not only for self-discovery purposes.
The newly released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record audience of 50, as somebody seems to recall.
It was Rother, back then, who wanted to push Harmonia and practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius, it was an unethical proposition.
The band declared its split in 1975.
Rother ended in the esoteric-spherical field and earned his life with albums such as "Flammende Herzen."
Cluster became fashionable again in the eighties, and went on to be more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessem live album is owed to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Grönland is a tribute to Krautrock as Germany’s own distinctive contribution to live music.
Neu! has already been excised in the process, as has Roedelius’ solo work.
The in the body resurrection of Harmonia occurs at the World Centre for Culture.
Publicly funded, part of the Worldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, Brit, former punk and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler."
So is Loveparade inventor Dr Motte.
The sketch of the whole range of influence Krautrock had on later pop music.
Harmonia’s part is to fill the gap of the supergroup.
The idiosyncratic sound is a reflection of Brian Eno’s philosophy: “The only true music, the future belongs to it.”
The producer, in a farmhouse room with Harmonia, appears.
Additional black and white photos showing machinery operating in a loosely wired manner play a part in the making of a legend.
In front of it all, the three veterans are once again improvising.
No longer by sticking microphones to organ and drums in order to get the instruments to produce unheard sounds via the self-made effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three tinkerers focused on technical aspects.
Even the resident choir does not change that.
Written by Barbara Morgenstern, there is coughing and shivering under sound clouds, and at one beautiful point, "Aaaaaaaah!" is sung with a slight accent.
Krautrock, after all, has always been a very English term.
It never was rock.
The roots were less in blues than in conservatories (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk), or in the escape from cultural and social conventions (Cluster).
The now exclaiming “1968!” are not entirely wrong, but, even now, Harmonia still remain cool.
On stage, even the most self-conscious things are considered most thoroughly.
How does music start and when it ends?
It can damage your nerves or it can give you a few moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere Is Not Cynical enough
The Hunting Party"and "Mörderischer Frieden" make two more films about Balkan War.
No one of them is convincing.
either the concepts are too much focused on action sequences and gunfire, or they are too dull.
Even Richard Gere, in “The Hunting Party,” cannot change that.
The good news first: Bosnian war criminals Karadzic and Mladic may still be hiding in the Balkan mountains.
The most beautiful man of the eighties has been lost, after too many very trivial roles in feel-good films for women and too many Buddhist press conferences have exhausted any desire to watch him.
The best reason why we might want to watch The Hunting Party is Richard Gere. (The full German title is The Hunting Party – When the Hunter becomes a hunter)
The performance is delightfully tongue-in-cheek. Essentially, his war reporter Simon Hunt is whom Gere could have ended up as, had fate and the film industry not been so kind to him.
The Hunting Party, along with the German production "Mörderischer Frieden,"which also debuts this week, is merely a continuation of the endless line of failed Balkan War movies.
"Mörderischer Frieden" is a very quick film about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian woman from Kosovan snipers - and one of them promptly falls in love with her.
The fact that the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole source of all evil is to be appreciated, but the film, in its TV-like shallowness, quickly falls into a few action sequences.
What remains is something like the German car-chase TV show "Alarm for Cobra 11" only with war taking place.
The Hunting Party, meanwhile, is almost like exhibit A in the investigation on why there has never been a good Balkan War movie.
With another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard is both), and at another time, the story of three US war reporters committed to track down Serbian war criminal supreme "The Fox" might have ended up being a new "Apocalypse Now."
The stories are quite similar: In both, small teams enter the forest to do something the military cannot do, and in both, the result is a journey into madness.
The reasons why The Hunting Party fails is that Simon Hunt is not allowed to be simply the run-down cynic with a heart of gold.
No, the script also has to saddle him with a romantic relationship with a Bosnian muslim woman who is later killed.
The Hunting Party goes off the rails when the reporters, in fast forward motion, achieve in the last five minutes what NATO, CIA and all the world’s bounty hunters have not achieved in five years: To catch the war criminal and leave him to the just revenge of the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so bad that you want to appeal to the International Court of Justice at The Hague on the basis of crimes against cinematic logic.
The film’s concern is actually a deeply human one.
It wants to condemn the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still free as they please, and it suspects the Americans and the French (apparently agree here) of not being overly concerned with their pursuit due to secret political horse-trading.
Good intentions and evil are so similar that a popular poem by Brecht appears.
In the poem, the wooden mask of an Asian demon resting on the poet’s work desk is described: “With sympathy I look at the swollen veins on the forehead, suggesting how hard it is to be evil.
The Hunting Party has the same swollen head, in that case suggesting how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan War movie.
The recent report in this paper reported that all Hollywood Iraq movies have utterly bombed.
One could add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Rules of thumb: If a star actor is running around in hot spots or on the minefields of the world, the result is something like "Rangoon,"with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond Borders,"with Angelina Jolie, or "Blood Diamond,"with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly, all these conflicts are too recent.
After all, years have taken before Hollywood could direct a good Holocaust movie in “Schindler’s List.”
Some film or other may still mature – Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter,""Apocalypse Now"or "Full Metal Jacket" were not exactly recognised as classics at the time.
Maybe we do not know enough about the violent world nowadays, with every instance of mass murder appearing at our homes in real time and on two screens simultaneously.
It robs screenwriters of the recklessness required to tell good stories.
The reason why “To Be or Not” or “The Great Dictator” are such good films is that Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime was.
To make good films, one must not want to be good.
Maybe a sarcastically distanced artistic view like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk’s is needed.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière’s Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "Because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in gruesome ways, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.
Beust Criticized on Olympics withdrawal
The mayor’s withdrawal of Hamburg’s application for the Summer Olympic Games has generated sharp criticism from politics and trade.
Many intend to continue fighting for the Waterfront Games.
Beust calls for a realistic assessment of the odds, however.
The withdrawal was described as "not good for the economic area."
No other project has generated as significant a motivational force in the city as the notion of the Olympics, he said.
Without that goal, the current sporting-politics momentum could not be maintained to this level.
Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate not to bury the project, but to develop a new long-term approach that follows a different timeline.
Mayor Ole von Beust repeated his previous statements on Wednesday, adding that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic, at least for the year 2028.
The German Olympic Sports Federation has to decide on an application for the Olympics, not Hamburg,"Von Beust told Welt Online.
The IOC was referring to the decision on Munich’s application for the Summer Olympic Games in 2018, expected in early December.
The preference means that we will not have a realistic chance in the previously considered period prior to 2028.
However, this did not mean that the dream was over for good, Von Beust said.
The Sports Federation Hamburg (HSB) regretted Beust’s comments.
The illusion that Hamburg was not going to play in the next 25 years was created.
”It is premature to spoil our odds by scrapping the plans at such early stage,”HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
Additionally, withdrawing from the application was contradictory to statements made by the head of the senate on the occasion of a reception at the plenary meeting of the German University Sports Federation, Ploß added.
There, Von Beust had insisted that Hamburg’s application for the 2015 Universiade was “no substitute”for Olympic Games in Hamburg, he said.
The University Sports Federation has nominated Hamburg as a candidate for application since last week.
The Social Democratic Party’s fraction in the Bürgerschaft, Hamburg’s parliament, accused the Senate of having wasted precious time by neglecting the construction of residences in Hamburg.
They delay the development of Kleiner Grasbrook for years, because the Senate kept all its eggs in the Olympic basket and neglected housing construction.
The Social Democrats always wanted an integrated concept for the Olympics with a view to residential use, and the Christian Democrats have been more focused on the event factor.
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games had generated much interest in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg was ultimately trumped by Leipzig.
Those Are Warhol’s Boxes
Connecting Sweden and wooden box makes one think of Ikea, rather than Andy Warhol.
It is or is it not?
Currently wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden are casting dark shadows on Warhol’s work.
The bulk of the ninety four Brillo Boxes "Type Stockholm"listed in it are forgeries.
The Swedish newspaper Expressen asked for the authenticity of Andy Warhol’s 1968 Brillo Boxes several years ago, now internal investigation at the Moderna Museet, Stockholm, has come to the conclusion that the six "Brillo Boxes"donated to the Museum in 1995 are forgeries – as are the bulk of the nearly 100 remaining Brillo Boxes in international art market.
The history is convoluted, a complex chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Andy Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red, white and blue design of the "Brillo"soap cardboard box.
The exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1969 presented – with Warhol’s consent – hundreds of Brillo Boxes made of cardboard: For economical reasons, they were not by Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard mill.
Them were not works of art, but models – mere sample pieces.
Similarly, Warhol apparently consented to the production of small wooden Brillo Boxes in Sweden in 1968, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about 15 boxes which made art and auction history as original Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes with the designation "Type Stockholm".
Some of them went for more than 100,000 dollars at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around 100 wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, and later consigned to him by Warhol.
The 105 boxes were produced in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
The time was when Warhol was already dead for three years.
In addition to the six Brillo Boxes belonging to the Moderna Museet, Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at the museum, examined three private Swedish owners, of which two were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: The pressboards were first primed and sandpapered, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of 1990 facsimiles shows that the paint was applied directly to the pressboard with a roller and without priming – and, further, that it wasn’t oil paint, but acrylic.
The six boxes are not authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol’s Brillo Boxes.
The Authentication Board had already announced an investigation into the "grave allegations" made in the case of the soapboxes back in July.
However, it has been kept in a steady silence ever since.
Renegade Soldiers Surrender in Manila
In the Philippines, renegade soldiers surrendered after seizing a hotel in Manila and demanding the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
At the hotel, Anthonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters that he was not going to cause bloodshed.
The hotel was previously stormed with tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had remained in the hotel for hours.
The majority of them have been tried in court for a failed coup in 2003, including Trillanes.
The latter then seized the trial to make sudden escape with 30 sympathizers.
The military police charged with guarding him have apparently defected and joined his mutiny.
They seized the Peninsula Hotel, demanding President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to be overthrown.
Loyal to the government troops cordoned off the area around the hotel.
The President called for an emergency meeting of the National Security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers’ action.
People have had it,"Trillanes said.
"We are calling on people to join us."
Other military units were to join the march shortly, said General Danilo Lim, former leader of the Scout Rangers elite unit.
Regulation critics had called for mass demonstrations against the president.
The government has been facing corruption claims for months.
Manila’s financial district was the focus of an attempted mutiny against Arroyo once before, by about 200 military members back in 2003.
After about 24 hours, the insurgency failed when the armed forces refused to join it.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet Major Shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has acquired more than 20 percent of telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share was 14.46 euros, the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent in share capital, it said.
The announcement followed speculation about a takeover.
Opportunities to increase its holding of Versatel were kept open, the company said.
United Internet says the move is aimed at advancing the consolidation of the German DSL market.
Early on Wednesday, speculation about an acquisition of shares was reported after Berenberg Bank added another five percent of its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by another five percent, to 15.1 percent.
The bank was merely holding the shares for a third party, rumors in the financial market suggested.
United Internet had already acquired Drillisch with around ten percent.
In the context of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million in new shares, with a total value of 106.4 million euros.
The United Internet bought 5.15 million shares at 31.4 million euros total.
Additionally, the companies are in talks about marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile telecommunications products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies have formed the joint venture MSP to acquire the rival Freenet.
The two companies will settle for approximately ten percent of Freenet and not use their option to buy another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies were keeping all their options open, especially with regard to increasing their share of Freenet AG, it was said.
United Internet and Freenet talks about a strategic partnership were aborted in mid November.
The months-long and at this stage fairly unclear power struggle over Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunication market.
At the end of the second quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and fixed-line customers.
United Internet and Drillisch have, so far, directly held 6.01 percent of Freenet shares.
It was reported that Drillisch has acquired another four percent of the shares, it said.
The option to acquire 18.49 percent from investment company Vatas was already agreed back in August.
