A Welsh MP who fears embarrassment
Some members of the Welsh Parliament are confused by a proposal to change the title of MP from AM (Assembly Member) to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The plan to change the name of the Welsh Parliament is the starting point.
Members of all political parties are concerned that this could lead to absurdity.
A Labour MP is concerned that the party will be "trampling on the Twp and the Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers, Twp means "dumb" and Pwp means "shit" in Welsh.
A Pride Campaign MP said the whole party was "disgruntled" and proposed an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative MP said the party was "open" to the name change, but that there was little difference in the pronunciation of MWP and "muppet".
By the way, the Welsh "w" sounds like the English "u" in the Yorkshire dialect.
The committee, which is currently drafting a name change, said: "The final decision on the title of a member of parliament is, of course, a matter for the member himself".
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposal, which revealed a strong consensus on changing the name of the parliament from Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of MP, the committee supported the proposal of the Welsh Parliament Member (WMP), but the MWP's proposal received the largest support in the public consultation.
The lawmakers are actually proposing an alternative, but the road to agreement could be a headache for Chairwoman Erin Jones, who is required to submit a draft legislation on the name change within weeks.
The bill would also include other reforms to the way the Parliament operates, including rules on no-confidence votes and the structure of the committee system.
In the process of considering a bill, the legislature has the final say on what to do with its own title.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing its name.
The vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" will be held on Sunday.
The referendum was organized to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a territory it calls Macedonia.
Greece has for many years argued that the name of its northern neighbor is worthy of its claim to Greek territory and has been strongly opposed to Macedonia joining the EU and NATO.
President of Macedonia, Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the country's name change, said he intends to ignore the results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price of joining the EU and NATO.
As the churches throughout Harlem struggle, the bells of St. Martin's Church fall silent.
"When I talk to older people, I hear that in the old days, any painting had to have a bar and a church", says Adam.
"Neither of them exists now".
He said there's no reason why the bar didn't disappear.
"We're communicating in a different way", he says now.
"The bar is no longer the neighborhood living room where you go to hang out".
As for the church, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the powers that be expect and that "sooner or later we will have to start all over again".
Furthermore, he says, churches are being replaced by apartments and mansions, and the people who live there do not cooperate in maintaining the church.
"I think most of the people who live in this building are white", he says, "and that will speed up the closing of the church because most of the people who are coming in are not going to church".
The church was built by a white congregation. Harlem then became a black city.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The building was owned by a black congregation that was praying nearby.
St. Martin's was taken over by the black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's shopping district.
The church was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but the parishioners of Father Johnson planned to rebuild it and commissioned a carillon.
John Howard Johnson and his successors, the Rev. St. Martin, named the carillon "Poor Man's Bell".
The musicians who came to play the carillon in July called it a "cultural treasure" and "an invaluable historical instrument".
According to Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, this is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysius D. Lind. Dionysius had come to the carillon in a church by the river 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complex story of builders, some brought by church leaders, others brought by the diocesan parishes.
In July, the governing body of the parish's governing clergy sent a letter to the parish concerned that the parish was "trying to bear the cost". However, the governing body was not involved in hiring architects or contractors.
Some parishioners claimed that the bishop's actions were opaque.
A 13-year-old boy is diving in a lobster pond in California when he's attacked by a shark.
On Saturday, the day the lobster season began, authorities reported that a 13-year-old boy was swimming in Lobster, California, when he was attacked and injured by a shark.
It happened just before 7:00 a.m. on Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
According to KSWB-TV, Chad Hamel was in San Diego on Saturday morning, bathing for an hour and a half with a friend, when a boy called for help and picked him up.
Hamel, at first, apparently thought he was just too excited to take the lobster, but soon realized it was a scream.
I got bit!"
His whole chain is torn. When he rescued the boy, Hamel realized.
"They all shouted out of the sea, 'There's a shark!' " says Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Lady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
We still don't know what kind of shark they attacked.
Life guard Captain Larry Giles said during a meeting that the shark had been confirmed to be present for weeks but had not been found to be a dangerous species.
Furthermore, the boy's upper torso has left a very serious injury.
For investigations and security, authorities have closed off the beach from Pont Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Escinitas for 48 hours.
Giles says that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are considered to be harmless.
Sainsbury's plan is a major step forward for the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's specialists used Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams for their staff's department-style beauty aisles.
As part of a major push to expand the £2.8 billion UK beauty market, which continues to grow despite declining sales of fashion and homewares, larger beauty corridors are being tested at 11 beauty stores nationwide, with the stores expanding next year if successful.
Investing in beauty was born out of a search for ways to make sure that supermarkets use all the shelf space when they are being sued by TVs, microwave ovens, and household items.
According to Sainsbury's, it announced that it would double the number of beauty products by 3,000. It also included the first-ever Revlon, Essie, Tweezman, and Dr. PawPaw brands.
Existing products such as L'Oreal, Maybelline, Burt's Bees will also be able to take up more space in the brand space, as seen in Boots.
The store has renovated its boutique zone to meet the demands of young people and is gearing most of its products towards vegans.
In addition, the perfumer's "Fragrance Shop" will be split into two Sainsbury's stores. Last week, one opened in Croydon, south London, and the other in Celliorok, Birmingham, later this year.
With online shopping and the trend of buying small amounts of food at local convenience stores on a daily basis, supermarkets have had to work on their craft to attract customers.
According to Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe, as supermarket chains offer more service and less food to compete with discount Aldi and Lidl, stores become more and more department stores.
Since buying two chains two years ago, which boosted grocery sales and increased the profitability of acquisitions, Sainsbury's has expanded its footprint by opening Argos stores in hundreds of stores.
The supermarket's previous attempt to refresh its beauty shop and pharmacy failed.
Sainsbury's had a venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship broke down when it came to how to distribute the proceeds from the pharmacy.
Sainsbury's has a new plan after selling 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was also involved, and had four stores that included La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mill Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, says, "By changing the look and feel of a beauty aisle, you change the environment of the customer.
And I'm also investing in specially trained colleagues who will give me advice.
Our brands cater to all needs, bringing the new beauty business to the old business in a beautiful environment and convenient location.
Peter Jones was "outraged" that Holly Willoughby had pulled out of a £11 million deal.
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones was "outraged" that Holly Willoughby had pulled out of an £11 million deal for Peter's lifestyle brand business, which focused on his new deal with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
Willowbee can't afford to spend time on the housewares and accessories brand Truly.
Their business was likened to the Groupe brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, Willowbee announced on Instagram that he was retiring from the business.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones at the tipping point to focus on a new big deal with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
On Thursday, when it was revealed on the Golden Girls programme that her new contract worth £1.5 million would make it impossible for her to spend time with the household goods and accessories brand Truly, Jones was "outraged" during a tense meeting at her headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, sources said.
The business has been likened to the Groupe brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, doubling Willoughby's estimated fortune of $11 million.
When Willowbee announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped out of England and headed for one of the villas.
Sources said, "Truly is the highest priority for Holly at the moment.
It's going to be a long-term thing, as we've seen in the last few decades.
Everyone was shocked by the decision to withdraw.
Nobody can believe what happened on Thursday, it was right there.
Marlow has a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods".
Experts say the departure of Willowbee, Britain's most trusted star, will cost millions, with huge investments in products ranging from cushions, candles, clothing and household items and the potential for further delays in launch.
This means the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been courting Jones and his wife, Tara Cappe, for 10 years.
Willowby launched Cap and Truly in 2016, and Jones joined as president in March.
They are on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willowbee is to become the M&S banner, replacing Ant McPartlin as ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night, "I will not comment on his business".
I had a hard time talking about it.
He joked at media criticism that his comments were considered "private" and were too optimistic about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up?
The president said, "The news anchor", in a very low voice.
"I'm not giving up anything".
The president said that Kim Jong Un is active in the second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June, which was hailed by the president as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Lee Jong-un, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday: "We still cannot confirm the 'appropriate response' from the United States to our early disarmament".
Instead, he said, the United States continues to impose sanctions to put pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea".
"We were going to war with North Korea before.
Millions of people will die.
And now we have a wonderful relationship".
Trump says efforts to improve relations with North Korea have produced desirable results, including the end of missile testing, the release of innocent hostages, and the conversion of American military remains.
And he used a strange metaphor when he talked about his relationship with Kim Jong-un.
"It's easy to be president, but I've called 200 people out there now rather than 10,000 people out there to fill a packed room", Trump said, pointing directly at the people in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake hit Indonesia, killing hundreds.
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, they said that foreign NGOs were not needed.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok, no national disaster has been declared that is necessary to call for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, we have made it clear that we will not ask for international assistance.
Save the Children is preparing to leave for Perth, but it is still unclear if foreign staff will be able to operate there.
Spoto, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities were considering whether to allow international aid to Pal.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia is experiencing, the country is desperately unprepared to face the wrath of nature.
Tsunami shelters are being built in Aceh, but not many on other coastlines.
Par is obviously short of tsunami sirens; if they were, more lives could be saved.
Even at the best of times, it is very risky to go to an Indonesian island.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The rescue boat that was docked in Lombok to carry the earthquake patients left for the port of Par, but it took at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure a central part of his campaign, and has invested in roads and railways.
However, the postponement of the re-election next year and the lack of funds have plagued Mr Joko's government.
President Jokowi is under pressure from tensions in the long-running sectarianism in Indonesia, where Muslims are the majority and more conservative.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced. Christian and Islamic gangs are fighting with machetes, bows and other barbaric weapons.
I recommend Daniel Starridge of Liverpool, who is deeply into the ecoloyers.
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute of Liverpool's Premier League defeat to Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Sheldon Shakiri, who was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal and his team was 1-0 down.
He taps the ball to the left end and shoots to the first post.
The ball went far over the goal and landed in the net on the right.
The ball hit Kepa Alizabalaga who jumped and became the goal.
"Shakes like me are as fast as they can, so I was just trying to get in my position to get the ball, and I was just trying to play my game with time", Starridge told Liverpool FC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched him a little bit, I didn't think too much, I just shot him".
Chelsea took the points from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute and lead 1-0 at half-time.
The Blues striker blocked the pass to Matteo Kovacic in the match, circled near midfield and raced towards Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick give and go in midfield.
And then I threw a beautiful slip-pass and I came close to the goal.
He broke through the defence and reached the first post net, and hit a shot across Liverpool's Alison Becker with his left foot.
On Wednesday, Liverpool played Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Italy.
In London on Thursday, Chelsea will play against Videotone in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency reported early Sunday.
The agency's spokesman, Stopo Puro Nugroho, reported that many people were trapped in the rubble of a building that collapsed in Friday's 7.5-magnitude quake, which produced waves as high as 20 feet.
In Pal, a city of 380,000, the ruins of collapsed buildings are scattered.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man for the murder of a woman.
A woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning, prompting a criminal investigation.
A 44-year-old man with a stab wound was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Moose, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested.
Police are urging people in the area to provide information.
Detective detective Brian O'Hagan states: "The investigation has started early, but we are calling on people in Birkenhead, Merseyside, to provide information.
"I'm listening to the taxi drivers, especially because they may have important video on their dash cams".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman's body was found in the Birkenhead area and that she had died inside.
In the afternoon, a friend who knew the woman arrived at the scene this morning to be questioned about where she was found.
Police are alerting the victim's neighbouring home and an investigation is underway.
A taxi driver in Grayson Moose is told by police that he cannot get in or out of his building when he tries to return to his building.
When he realized what had happened, he said nothing.
Currently, residents are told they will be allowed in after a few hours.
I heard the police say the whole city is being treated as a murder scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
I kept saying, "That's terrible".
At 2 p.m., two patrol cars were inside the ropes, and one was just outside.
Several officers were inside the rope, guarding the building blocks.
If you have any information, please contact DM @MerPolCC or call 101 or call Climaestopper anonymously on 0800 555 111 and report log 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in the Houses of Parliament is the latest monument to be subjected to "history being rewritten".
The expulsion was poetic justice, for the destruction of many British cultural and religious artifacts, such as the Taliban, by fanatical Puritans.
Crick called the Cromwell Society "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, says: "The subject of the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of the statue.
The symbols of the English Civil War were neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps a different Cromwell was sacrificed by the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The grandiose portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Sonnecroft is a testament to nineteenth-century thought and part of the historical record of a figure many still believe to be worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith says to the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was more of a defender of Parliament against external pressure in the late nineteenth century than he is today, and in his case, of course, against the monarchy.
Whether that is the perfectly correct expression is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of the country, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His service as Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and remembrance".
Killer pig moles kill Chinese farmers.
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, known only by his name Yuan, was found with his artery slit at a six-pipe water market in the province of Wei and his blood splattered around a pigsty, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, pig farmers in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, were vaccinating pigs.
He said he and his cousin were traveling to sell 15 pigs at a market in the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the neighboring pigsty open.
There was a big boar in the cabin with a bloody mouth.
According to reports, a forensic examination confirmed that 550 pounds of pigs had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and broken".
CCTV footage showed Yuan entering the market to feed pigs at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday.
The body was found an hour after he died.
The pig that killed the man was neither Yuan's nor his cousin's.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pigs were isolated to ensure that no one was harmed and that police were gathering evidence.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, pigs have attacked humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig trapped a Welsh farmer in a truck and his wife got away with it.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by a pig in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can be a "trigger".
"I'm just playing.
I'm not a kid, I'm curious, I'm not going hunting.
"We just have to be honest and do the right thing", he says.
Hurricane Rosa's debris is bringing heavy rain to the southwest of the United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it passes through the cold waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico.
But Rosa, the flood-like rains will continue to hit northern Mexico and the southwestern United States for the next few days.
Rosa's winds were 85 miles per hour, a Category 1 hurricane, as of 5 a.m. Eastern Time Sunday, located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, new traff in the Pacific emerges and moves eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical low, it pushes tropical moisture northward toward the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa brought 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
And, as tropical moisture interacts with approaching traff, there will be extensive heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
In rural areas, 1 to 4 inches of rain will pose a risk of flooding, mudslides, and landslides.
With high tropical humidity, rainfall increases to two to three inches per hour, especially in parts of Arizona and southern Nevada.
Some parts of the Southwest, especially much of Arizona, will get two to four inches of rain.
The dispersive nature of tropical rain can lead to flooding and the situation can rapidly deteriorate.
Therefore, it is very dangerous to walk in the desert during the tropical rains.
Heavy rains can turn the canyon into a river, and there can be thunderstorms, strong winds, and thunderstorms.
The approaching trough is causing locally heavy rainfall along parts of the coastline of Southern California.
A total of more than 0.5 inches of rain may fall. This may cause minor mudslides and road slippage.
This is the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
Late Sunday and early Monday, a sudden tropical storm approaches Arizona, with rain expected to spread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain is expected to spread widely between Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, temperatures fluctuate sharply throughout the United States to lower Arctic temperatures, but the tropics remain quite warm.
It can cause dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of a dramatic temperature difference in the central United States on Sunday.
Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, have temperatures that differ by almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the summer heat will increase again.
With 80 degrees extending from the southern plains to parts of the northeast, much of the central and eastern United States is expected to warm in October.
New York is likely to reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast predicts that temperatures will often be above average in the eastern United States in early October.
I'm not going to say that.
More than 20 million people watched testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and a woman claiming to have been sexually assaulted in the 1980s, Brady Ford, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, in the final Friday session, the network suspended regular programming and continued political support because of a twist in an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long investigation of the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to pick on her and strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh testified with great fervor that it would never happen.
Friday, according to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people have seen it.
At this time, the company's ratings were the average of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Other companies such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network did not have immediate figures available.
Nielsen always has a problem with the people he sees in his office.
And that's roughly the same as the number of people watching a football game or the Academy Awards.
The Fox News Channel has an average of 5.69 million viewers in a single day of hearings, Nielsen says, because of hosts whose opinions strongly support Kavanaugh's candidacy.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million, and CNN has 2.52 million.
It was a topic after the hearing.
Flake was the lead on Friday.
On Friday morning, as moderate Republicans declared they would support Kavanaugh and vote for him, he was surrounded by CNN and CBS reporters and shouted at by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He was standing with his eyes closed during a live CNN broadcast, while he was being vilified.
"I'm standing in front of you", said one woman.
"Does he seem to be telling the truth?"
He also said, "You have power because women are powerless".
According to Flake, his office issued a statement saying that he should have more to say at the committee hearing before the elevator closed.
Hours later, when the Judiciary Committee is about to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination by the full Senate, all stations will begin live broadcasts.
But Flake said he would only do so under the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the candidate next week, as a handful of Democrats claim.
Flake was as confident as a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was clear that without an investigation, Republicans could not vote to appoint Kavanaugh.
President Trump has the FBI investigating the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May has condemned criticism of Brexit as "political trickery".
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, denounced criticism that her plans to leave the EU were "enjoying the political game" of Britain's future at the expense of national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who was featured on the front page of the newspaper, highlighted his attack on the so-called Checker Plan, saying that it was "absolutely fantastic" that Britain and the EU would collect tariffs on each other.
In connection with the death of an LSU player who was beaten by Wade Sims, police have arrested Dayton Simpson.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested for second-degree murder and sent to prison, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video showing Simms and Simpson fighting, and police noted that Simms lost his glasses on the way.
Police found the glasses at the scene, and Simpson's DNA was found in them, CBS series WAFB reported.
After hearing Simpson's case, police said he admitted to shooting Wade and causing fatal injuries.
The compensation was reported to be $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department said it was grateful for the cooperation of the Louisiana State Police Mobilization Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local citizens in bringing about the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Aleva expressed his gratitude to local law enforcement for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
At 6 feet 6 inches, he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"I've come to what I feared", says Wade.
Mexico City erupts ash.
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern side of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Management Center warned people to evacuate the volcano on Saturday, and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours from the volcano that began activity from the crater.
The center was monitoring the shaking and tremors.
SNS images show ashes covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Sochi.
Geologists had confirmed that the volcano, 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, had been increasing in activity since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
The Catalan independence election anniversary is being postponed.
Six people were arrested after pro-independence protesters clashed with police in Barcelona on Saturday, and thousands of people took part in a demonstration marking the anniversary of the Catalan secession vote.
When a group of facial-covered pro-separatists were pushed into the motorcade, they threw eggs and powder paint, creating a dark cloud of dust on the streets, which were usually crowded with tourists.
The scaffolds also used their guards to end the fighting and acted with the police during the day.
For several hours, pro-independence groups cried out "Forget, never forgive" and confronted the coalitionists who shouted "Spain, forever".
According to local newspapers, 14 people are being treated for minor injuries sustained by protesters.
Tensions are rising in the pro-independence region, a year after the October 1 referendum, which was hailed by separatist Catalans, but considered illegal by Madrid.
The overwhelming majority voted for independence, but the opposition boycotted the vote, which resulted in low turnout.
According to Catalan authorities, police tried to block elections at polling stations in areas where violent clashes were taking place last year, injuring about 1,000 people.
Pro-independence groups were campaigning through the night on Friday to stop demonstrations with the help of the state police.
The activities progressed, but they were forced to go down another path.
The 68-year-old electrical engineer Narcis Termes, who is involved with separatist activities with his wife, says Catalonia no longer has any hope of independence.
"Last year was a great opportunity.
I saw my parents crying and happy because they could vote, but now I'm stuck".
Despite a small victory in the regional elections in December, the Catalan independence party is struggling to gain momentum this year ahead of the trial of its leaders for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on the phone for the police, said the conflict was being exacerbated by both politicians.
"It's getting more and more pressing", he says.
Oriol Funqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced on Sunday that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Candidating for European elections is the best way to denounce the contempt and repression of democracy we have received from the Spanish government", he says.
London, Berry cars hit a house, men arrested
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after they collided several times at a house in Londonbury.
The incident occurred at around 19:30 BST on Thursday in Balligarh Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gate and the building itself.
There are also signs of a crossbow being fired from the car.
In a MEGA strike, Livingston beat the Rangers 1-0.
The first goal by Dory Menga ensured Livingston's victory.
Livingston was surprised to see Ranger give away his second defeat in 18 games to Ibrox Club manager Steven Gerrard.
Gary Holt's side matched the second Hyberian, proving that Dory Menga's attack was different.
Gerrard's side remain unbeaten in the premiership this season and face eight-point trailing Leaders Hearts on Sunday.
Before that, on Thursday, the Rangers will host RapidWine in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends their division's undefeated streak to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste defeat after replacing Kenny Miller last week.
Livingston misses his chance against the sluggish visitors.
Holt's team should have been ahead long before he scored.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged the effort towards the goal; then Alan Lithgow could only direct a wider effort after that slide to fill Craig Halkett's heading beyond the goal.
The hosts were happy to see the Rangers play in front of them.
And that's how the important goal was achieved.
The Rangers recognized the free kick, and Livingston set up the opening, DeCran Gallargue and Robinson to set up the manga.
By that point, the Rangers had controlled possession, but could not break through home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely interrupted.
Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly, but the pattern continued into the second half.
Scott Pittman was denied a shot at Rangers goalkeeper Alan MacGregor and Lisgour's legs from another Livingston set play.
Cross was in Livingston's box and cleared all the way, but two penalty claims were denied to Halkett's replacement Glenn Middleton, and one to a handball.
The Livingston phenomenon is analyzed.
I'm going to be on the BBC Scotland Arras de Alamont with Tony Macallorena.
Livingston's amazing performance and results.
For men, they were excellent and they kept exceeding expectations for this upward trajectory.
Their playstyle and staff have changed little since returning to the top flight, but he has to go to Holt for the great credit for the way he has powered the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
While Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to his side, Captain Halkett had put together a superbly organized defense.
The Ranger, however, lacked inspiration.
They were sometimes as good as they were under Gerrard, but they did not quite live up to those standards.
They missed their final ball - they only opened the home side once - and that's like a wake-up call for the Rangers.
Erdoğan, you'll have a mixed reception in Cologne.
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders gathered for breakfast in Berlin, and there were smiles and blue skies.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, which aims to repair relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then went on to open a huge new mosque in Cologne.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the more than 25,000 strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters turned up nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters (many of them Kurds) also listened to their voices and condemned Prime Minister Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests of the conflict reflect the disagreement between the visitors, who are welcomed as heroes by some German Turks, and the visitors, who are criticized by others as dictators.
Deptford Road collision: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred at 10:15 a.m. local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance ran to help, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred about a month after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childress Street, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and report him to his family.
The road is closed and bus routes are being implemented, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Longlartin Prison, six guards were injured in a riot.
Six guards were injured in the riot at the maximum security men's prison, the guards said.
The riot at HMP Long Glatten, Worcestershire, continues at around 09:30 on Sunday, UK time.
Specialist "tornado" guards were called in to deal with the disturbances in the wing where eight prisoners were being held.
The officer suffered minor facial injuries and was treated at the scene.
A prison official said: "Special trained guards have been deployed to deal with the incidents at HMP Long Glatten.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in prisons, and those who are held accountable will be referred to the police and spend longer in prison".
HMP Long Glat contains over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden was attacked by a prisoner and treated in hospital.
And in October last year, a task force was called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which a staff member was attacked with a billiard ball.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger from the cannon water of Hurricane Rosa.
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but the risk of cannon water is very high early next week as the residual energy from Hurricane Rosa travels through the southwestern desert.
The National Weather Service has already issued a rain advisory for Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, including western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, on Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is forecast to approach with rain late on Monday and hit Phoenix on Tuesday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted: "Since 1950, only 10 tropical depressions have maintained tropical storms and low pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ line.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict two to four inches of precipitation, and an unprecedented six inches of rainfall on the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, may be 1 to 2 inches, and rarely up to 4 inches.
The area is suffering from drought, so the rain of roses may be a blessing for those who are not at risk of cannon water.
Flooding is a very serious problem, but some rainfall may be beneficial as the southwest is currently in a dry state.
According to the United States, more than 40 percent of Arizona is in at least extreme drought, the second highest category", reports the drought monitor at weather.com.
Initially, Hurricane Rosa's path crosses the Baja California peninsula in Mexico and makes landfall.
Hurricane Rosa had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph on Sunday morning, and was located 385 miles south of Punta Eujenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is hitting the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean and is losing its strength.
Therefore, a tropical low pressure system is forecast to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or at night.
There is a high chance of heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico and a high risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of three to six inches, up to 10 inches, is expected in northwest Sonora from Baja California", weather.com reported.
Rosa will cross Mexico north as a tropical storm before approaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression early Tuesday morning, and will pass through Arizona and move into southern Utah by midnight on Tuesday.
"The main danger to Rosa and its effects is the extreme rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Desert", said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is predicted to cause life-threatening water cannon, desert mudflows, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack. Four people arrested for attempted murder.
Three teenage boys and a man in his 20s were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured on the Excelsior terrace in Norton, Mid-Summer, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and is in a stable condition.
Somerset Police said that a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in Ladstock, Avon.
The police are waiting for someone with cell phone footage of what happened to come out.
Trump says Cabano is suffering from the Democrats' meanness and anger.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of no-confidence in the Democratic Party's cruel and vicious approach", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said in his nomination process that Cabano "suffers from the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party".
Cabano testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying her claims that she had sexually assaulted Christine Braidsey Ford when they were teenagers decades earlier.
Feed also testified at her trial on her claims.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the greatness, character and courage of Cabano that day".
"The vote to confirm Judge Cabano is a vote to confirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a legal professional with an outstanding record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred to Cabano's recommendation in a remotely-referenced speech when discussing the importance of Republican participants in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running", he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for the great candidates".
Trump argued that Democrats have a mission to "resist, hinder".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Cabano's appointment will be held by Friday, a top GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have been killed and many more washed up after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on Friday at Palm Beach, and at dusk a wave of up to six metres (18 ft) pushed ashore, killing many and destroying the entire road.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were on the beach and they were killed because they did not flee immediately", Stopo Puro Nugroho, a representative of Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), briefly reported in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it swept away cars, trees, houses, and hit everything on land", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had reached the outside world at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Some 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Pal.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges toppled and destroyed, and mosques surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued in coastal cities on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Applied Patent and Trademark Law (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's quake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
Geographically, the city, which is located at the edge of a long and narrow bay, may have expanded in size.
N'Goloho described the damage as "widespread", and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of a destroyed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nguroho said the casualties and damage were worse in the coastal area called Dongara, 300 km (190 miles) north of Pal, closer to the quake's epicenter.
"There was no information from the Dongala at all and communication was completely dysfunctional", said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be worse", he said.
Officials said the waves came during the warning, but on Saturday authorities were widely criticized for not informing them that the tsunami had hit Pal.
Amateur video shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of the building screaming desperately to people on the street below to warn them of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused major power outages and communications around Pal are cut off, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
While the army has begun to transport relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities in cargo planes, evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport will reopen only for rescue operations but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Pal on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
Donga World Vision staff were safely evacuated to Pal, where they were in a waterproof sheeting shelter that their employees had installed in their office courtyard, but they saw a devastated landscape on the road, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses", he said.
It's really bad.
Although aid groups have begun to show signs of a move to start disaster relief operations, some claim that overseas aid workers with deep expertise are being blocked from travelling to Pal.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and personnel from abroad will only be distributed if a disaster site is declared a disaster zone in the country.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a state-level disaster", said Aula Ariani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government said, 'OK, this is a national disaster. We can get international help, but we're not there yet.'"
On the second night in Par on Friday, after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing had hoped that their loved ones were a miracle in the tragic story of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman trapped under rubble, with her mother's body at her side for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national parachuting team, trained two missing paragliders at the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Loora Hotel were students, including Mr. Mandagi.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon circulated among the paragliding community in the hours following news of the Loora Hotel collapse, saying he desperately sent a WhatsApp message to a competitor of Pearl's who was attending a beach festival.
His message resulted in only a gray checkmark instead of a blue check.
"I think that means the message didn't get through", he said.
A robber in Newport, Levi's, robbed a cash machine while refilling $26,750.
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, while Brink employees were filling up at an ATM in Levy's Newport, thieves stole $26,750.
The driver of the car was preparing to empty the ATM of the entertainment complex and deliver more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he was working, another man "came running from behind a Brink employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered".
According to the release, witnesses saw multiple suspects flee the scene, but police did not identify the number of people involved in the incident.
If you have any information regarding their identity, please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, is sometimes nicknamed Yee, which was also used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change will be made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album Yandhi is expected.
He will be appearing on the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons", the show's creators said.
Like the acronyms for his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, speaking about radio host Big Boy and his album title.
"So I am you, I am us, it is about us".
It starts with the only meaningful kanji, and it becomes the reflection of our good and bad, confused, all of us - yes.
It's more of a reflection of who we are".
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, known variously as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced his choice of the name Love & Brother Love this year.
West's former collaborator Jay-Z also used hyphens in capital letters.
The Mexican AMLO will use the military against civilians
As the country marks the 50th anniversary of the bloodshed of students, Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised at the Trotterco Plaza on Saturday that "we will never use military force to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, when the left-wing student movement was rooted in Latin America, the army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador promised to provide monthly subsidies to people studying, to open more free universities and to support young Mexicans.
He said youths are running to criminal gangs because of unemployment and lack of educational opportunities.
The United States should double its financial support for AI.
As China becomes more active in AI, the United States should double its investment in research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI entrepreneur who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The United States as a whole lacks an AI strategy, but this was commented on after AI was notified by various departments of the US government.
Meanwhile, China introduced a plan last year: to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, Lee said, considering that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking to make the next leap in AI.
The doubling of funding will also double the opportunity for the next big thing in US AI, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book, AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month by Horton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures and investor in Face++, China's most prominent AI company.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he created an AI system that beat America's top Oscars players, and he later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee has agreed to past US government technology conventions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and has visited to help find the next visionary.
Researchers in the United States work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"China is not taking away academic leaders; it is cooperation", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university tutors to study AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy would also help strengthen U.S. efforts to combat AI.
"I think PhDs in AI should be given green cards automatically", he said.
The State Council of China issued a plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government agencies pay researchers in the United States, but the quality of Chinese academic research is low, Lee said.
In the United States, the Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center earlier this year, which intends to involve partners from business and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it's going to invest $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, US regulations to create a national security commission with artificial intelligence have not seen action for months.
Macedonians are holding a referendum on changing the country's name.
Macedonians will hold a referendum on Sunday to decide whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia or to settle a decade-old dispute with Greece that has prevented it from seeking membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, voted to join NATO and the EU, saying that the people of the north claimed their territory.
The two governments signed an agreement in June under the newly proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would destroy the ethnic identity of Macedonia's main Slavic population.
President Georgy Ivanov did not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the voter turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent threshold for a referendum to be valid.
Read the question on the referendum: "Do you agree to accept the agreement with Greece and become a member of NATO and the EU?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worthwhile for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join institutions like the EU and NATO.
"I came to vote today for the young people of Macedonia, for the future of the country, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje.
He said that while it was not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of the legislature would abide by the results of the vote for the decision.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in the legislature.
The election commissioner of the week said no fraud was reported as of 1 p.m.
However, the turnout remained at just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dasko took part in the Macedonian referendum on 30 September 2018 in Stromitsa, Macedonia on the name change that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and moved his chair in front of a tent set up by people boycotting the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to participate cautiously, not through the service door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonians, we can rely on other countries like China and Russia to be part of the European-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a 20 percent unemployment rate.
"More than 80 percent of the population supports the EU and NATO, so I believe the majority will support it", Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "yes" result would be "a proof of our future".
According to the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, a poll published last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters said they would participate in the referendum - below the required voting rate.
In another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Thelma, 57 percent of respondents said they would go to the polls on Sunday.
He said that 70 percent of them would vote yes.
A referendum requires 50 percent and one vote to succeed.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.
Recommendation: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City, who has overcome Brighton's full defence to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's defence to win 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Sunday.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute with such ridiculous ease.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the start of the series.
He competed against three Brighton defenders before going out into the open field.
Agüero and four other green shirts surrounded him.
He pushed one defender and knocked out a few more at the edge of the Brighton box.
And he found Sterling and passed him to his left.
England international FW used a first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, and used his right boot to hit the shot on the right side of the net, carrying Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero was struggling with a leg problem", City manager Pep Guardiola told Rivoter.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's how it happened.
He scored in that moment, and we were lucky".
However, it was Sterling who gave Sky Blue their first advantage in the Premier League battle.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in Brighton's area in that game.
He sent a beautiful slip-pass along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked Sterling a few times before he was sent to the first post.
The Sky Blue forward pushed the ball into the net just before it slid into the boundary.
City play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Line Necker Arena in Genkheim, Germany.
Sharzer wants to play Spoiler against the Rockies.
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so there's not much reason to start over.
However, the combative Sharks hope to take the mound against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the playoff impact still remains for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night to earn at least a wild card spot, but they want to ensure their first district championship.
"Even if we play meaninglessly, we can at least throw, and the crowd combined with the atmosphere here in Denver and the other teams will probably be playing at the highest level at any point this year".
You don't want to fight like that, do you?"
The Nationals have not yet released Sunday's starter, but they are reportedly going to take Sharzer on the pitch in such circumstances.
Scharzer is scheduled to make his 34th start and will pitch at his usual break on Sunday, Thursday, for the bulb season.
This season, Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia.
The president, speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, referred to the remote Supreme Court circuit's selection of Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we've done is in November.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big big-- and I'm not running, but I'm actually running, so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates".
Trump continued, "Look at this terrible Democratic extremist group, and you'll see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, and they're not happy with the inferiority.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to ignore to gain power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
He said the Democrats' mission is to "resist, obstruct".
"And you're going to see that over the next four days", he said, calling Democrats "angry, disgusting, and disingenuous".
He attracted the attention of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including nominating Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein and ranking her by name, and received a large opposition from the audience.
"Do you remember what she said?"
Did you see any documents?
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
I can't stand people who talk about their feelings.
I was hardly surprised when the momentum activists of my local party voted to evacuate me.
After all, I am the front-runner in the Labour MPs' party - all of whom say I am not welcome.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, a member of Congress, was treated similarly for taking a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the move to blame came from disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and ironically in Europe were issues Jeremy disagreed with past leaders on.
In a notice to the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, he said: "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were just that.
Sadly, today, if it had not been for the tone of many meetings and if it had actually begun, the promise of a policy of "more kindness and gentleness" had long been forgotten.
It is gradually becoming clear that various views are not acceptable in the Labour Party, and that all views are judged only in terms of whether they are acceptable to the party leader.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues who thought I had similar political views started to turn on me and ask me to take a position that I had never taken before, or to agree on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I spoke publicly - and it's not that important what I said - I was constantly getting harassed on social media, demanding that the election be annulled, criticizing the Centre's policies, saying I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who's had that experience.
In fact, I think I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments I get tend to be political.
They are confronted daily with the whirlwind of sexism or racist abuse, but they are never ashamed of their colleagues' professionalism and determination.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the extent to which abuse has become routine.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn argued that Labour should foster a culture of tolerance.
It is true that we are no longer a broad church, and any movement of "uncertainty" or change in party selection rules is becoming smaller.
Over the last two years, I've tried to be humble, to not be too loud, and I've given a lot of advice about how to make things work.
But that's not why I entered politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, and was prompted by the Thatcher government's negligence that literally destroyed my comprehensive school classrooms, I have worked to support better public services for those who need them most, whether they be local councillors or government ministers.
I have never hidden my policies, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was confused about my policy positions or the areas in which I disagreed with the current leaders.
To those who pushed the movement on Friday, I can say that the country is struggling to deal with Brexit, which is hurting our families, our businesses and our public services, and I cannot understand the desire to waste my time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour leadership.
But my message is not to the momentum of Nottingham, but to my supporters, whether Labour or not: I am proud to work for you and I promise not to be deterred by my belief that the best interests of all of you are served by the exceptional threat or political convenience.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
Air 38-17: undefeated air to the top.
The final result may have changed somewhat with two late tries, but Air definitely deserves to win this fantastic and entertaining Tenente premiership match today.
They're currently at the top of the table, with only 10 unbeaten sides.
Finally, it was a better opportunity to get better defense and better home field advantage, which coach Peter Marty was fully entitled to.
"We have been tested through the game so far, and we are still unbeaten and should be happy", he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose said, "Trust in the Air; they got a better chance than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try to replace Frazier Climo pushed the air forward, but the Warriors opened the game, and a yellow card from Rory Hughes gave Melrose the numbers, and Jason Baggott took an unconverted try.
Klymo extended the lead to Air with a penalty just before halftime and entered the break with 17-5 to Air to decide the solo trials.
But Melrose entered the second half, and Patrick Anderson's try from Baggot was reduced to five points.
After a long wait for Lalide Knot, who was left on a stretcher with a serious injury, and a re-opening, Air was further advanced by a try from Stafford McDowall in place of Climo.
Air-acting captain Blair McPherson received a yellow card, and again Melrose was dismissed at the end of a high-pressure spell, with an attempt by Bruce Colvin to pay for an extra player.
However, the home side came back and again Sturgeon Hutchinson tackled Climo without the ball, received a yellow card and landed behind the airmole as McPherson advanced from the penalty line-up.
After Kyle Lowe collected a box kick from David Armstrong, Climo replaced him from almost a restart, sending Frank's Gregor Henry to the fifth try of the home side.
The Steel Game star is going to start a new career in the restaurant industry.
SteelGame star Ford Kieran seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after it is revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Jack Jarvis, 56, is writing and co-starring in a popular BBC show with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be one of the show's last, and Keenan appears to be planning for life after Craiglan.
According to official records, he is a director of Adrift Moon Limited.
Scottish sources suggested that Keenan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "active restaurant trade", but the actor declined to comment on the story.
"The sea is ours": Inland Bolivia wants the court to reopen the road to the Pacific
The crew patrol the naval headquarters equipped with rapeseed ropes.
The blue flag of the sea flies over public buildings.
The naval base from Lake Chichicoca to the Amazon is covered with the motto: "The sea is ours by right".
It's our duty to get it back".
Through inland Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost in Chile in the bloody resource conflict of the 19th century is still vivid - the desire to sail the Pacific once again.
These hopes are perhaps the best in decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has a spirit of dynamism, unity and calm, and of course we expect a positive outcome", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Cardadilla.
Many Bolivians, seeing the ICJ's decision on national screens, are optimistic that the Hague court will agree with Bolivia's claim that after decades of proper consultation, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign sea access to Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, Evo Morales, who is facing controversy in his re-election bid next year, will also participate in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court's decision in favor of Bolivia is unlikely, and if it is, it will not change much.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no authority to award territory to Chile and does not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The ICJ's decision, which came just six months after the final debate, shows that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the Bolivian factor is far from advancing, and in the last four years it may have been pushing back.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian government", Zarate said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric, she suggested, shattered the remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk until a certain point, but it is extremely difficult to continue the discussion after this.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
The former president of Bolivia, Eduardo Rodriguez Verze, who is representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decisions are unusually swift.
On Monday, he said, Bolivia would be "a special opportunity to open a new era in relations with Chile" and "put an end to 139 years of disagreements on mutual interests".
Carzadilla also denied that Morales (still one of Latin America's most popular presidents) was using the ocean issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to learn that we need to move on from the past".
North Korea says that if they can't trust the United States, they won't do nuclear disarmament.
North Korea's foreign minister Li Yongho says that if Washington cannot be trusted, it will never be the first to disarm.
Li was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to honor the promises made during the Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His comments are being interpreted as those of the United States. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be trying to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after his visit to Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Li said that the US objection to the declaration that continued sanctions and the end of the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees is a "dream fantasy".
Washington is wary that Pyongyang will agree to the declaration without first making significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a growing skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up its weapons, which is considered the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show is bringing the latest line of massive headwear to the high street near you.
If you want to add to your collection of hats or block out the sun completely, this is the way.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown announced a lineup of quirky oversized headgear for the stylish Runway SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Very unrealistic hats have been flooding Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching designs to Catwalks.
Valentino's most notable work was a beige hat with a wide overhead feathered cap that covered the model's head.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry-covered suikaks, wizard hats, and even pineapples, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Tom Brown has released another selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were sewn up with lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than auto-cultivated.
One of the pieces resembled full scuba diving gear with a snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you're keeping up with your fashion philosophy, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that a giant bonnet could go on the high street near you.
The special-sized hats are heated to the heels of the two-foot-wide-tipped la bomba, a straw hat that can be seen by anyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very unrealistic hat that's been jumping on social media has sent another big piece to Catwalk - a beach bag that's almost as big as a model in a bathing suit.
A burnt orange laffite bag with a white leather handle and a ribbon with a laffite fringe was a highlight of the La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "We expect big hats and beach bags to hit the high street next summer - and with designers having such a big impact, it's hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens.
Private schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence, and this is another set of outstanding test scores that are only enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community achievements, and continues through 2018.
The schools, which are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which has over 30,000 students across Scotland, strive to provide the highest level of service to students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for higher education, their chosen careers, and to live in society as global citizens.
In this education sector, which can design and implement customized school curricula, modern languages continue to be a popular school subject.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak in a language you understand, it goes into people's heads.
When you speak in that person's native language, it goes into that person's heart".
This reminds us that we should not rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
Recent results from this year's test show that languages are at the top of the league table and that private schools have the highest pass rates.
A total of 68 percent of students learning a foreign language received a higher grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students studying Pekingese achieved higher A-grades, while 72 percent of students studying German, 69 percent of students studying French, and 63 percent of students studying Spanish also achieved A-grades.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are encouraging foreign language learning as an important skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages are treated as electives in private school curricula, as well as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment Skills Board found that 17 per cent of the reasons employers struggle to fill vacancies are due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential for preparing young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a context where globalization is increasing the number of job opportunities that require languages.
Whatever career you choose, if you have a foreign language, you will have acquired these lifelong skills, which will be really beneficial in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners means that multilingual talent has a competitive advantage.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults found that 75 percent of those who spoke a foreign language did not have sufficient conversational skills and only 15 percent spoke French.
It is for these reasons that it is important for children today to invest in language education.
For children in developing countries in particular, having multilingual skills will increase their chances of getting meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, the language taught differs from school to school.
While many schools will focus on more traditional modern languages, others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Pekingese and Japanese.
No matter what the child is interested in, there is plenty of language choice in private schools with teachers who are experts in this field.
Private schools in Scotland are focused on providing learning environments where children can prepare for the future and acquire the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future.
In a global business environment, languages remain crucial to the future of a country and must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to provide Scotland's young people with this choice, diversity and even better education.
Il faut bien le faire. It is necessary to do it.
John Edward is a member of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron, the Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
LeBron James will soon be making his fan-awaited Los Angeles Lakers debut.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton announced Sunday that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But I don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"It's going to be a minute or less than 48 minutes", Walton says on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will only be playing for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this point in my career, I don't need a preseason game to prepare for the season", he says.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, his YouTube channel.
President Donald Trump will begin a series of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies planned for next week, including Trump-friendly locations in Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the nomination of the Supreme Court pending, Trump is seeking to consolidate support for the upcoming midterm elections as the Republicans risk losing their congressional majority in November's election.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be viewed online via a live stream on YouTube:
With the Senate nomination vote delayed by up to a week and under pressure as the FBI investigates allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Trump is likely to comment on Kavanaugh's hearing this week.
But the main purpose of the rally, which continues to be held, is to give a boost to the Republican momentum as it faces a difficult battlefield ahead of the November election.
According to Reuters, the Trump campaign has therefore decided to hold five rallies next week aimed at "strengthening volunteers and supporters to protect and expand the Republican majority in the Senate and House".
"The president will travel to as many states as possible ahead of the busy election season, as securing a majority of congressional seats is so important to his policies", a Trump campaign spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.
According to Metro News of West Virginia, tonight's rally at Wheeling's West Bank Arena "may draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media".
Trump won West Virginia by more than 40 percent in 2016, but Saturday's visit to West Virginia will be his second in a month.
Trump is trying to support the Republican candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
According to Reuters, West Virginia University political scientist Simon Heder said that the president's "coming to push him is not a good sign for Morrissey".
Ryder Cup 2018: US selection shows promise for Sunday's singles
After a three-session game with a one-sided result, the Saturday afternoon Foursome got just the Ryder Cup it needed.
In sports, the concept of "momentum" like a pendulum is unfounded, but especially in these kinds of competitions, the athlete really believes in "momentum".
So which one of us is going to be the dominant one?
"We had a six-point lead, but now we're four points ahead, so I think we have a little bit of momentum", Jordan Spears says as he finishes the day.
Of course, the European team is four points ahead with 12 games to go.
As Spears says, the U.S. team is feeling the chase, and they've been playing together all day, and Spears and Justin Thomas are in good shape, with three points each in four games.
Spears has been ruthless from tee to green, with exemplary results.
He and Thomas led by two after two holes, but the rounds went on and the shouts of blessing grew louder, sinking the decisive putt and tying the fourth game.
A similar cry he raised when he put a pat on the 15th hole to win was to convey his conviction that the U.S. team had not yet lost.
"You have to focus on your game and do your best", Spears says.
Currently, these players have only one game left in the season.
It's 18 holes to win.
Only Francesco Morinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who have scored more points than Spears and Thomas over the past two days, are the biggest talk of the Ryder Cup.
These two, both strange and beloved European selections, won four of their four fights without making a single mistake.
Not only were these two, called "Mollywood", the only pair not to bowl during the Saturday afternoon session, but they avoided bowl games on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and late nine o'clock on Friday mornings.
In addition to this, and the energy of the two players in the fierce crowd, it is clear that they are the players to beat on Sunday. And there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Morinari to make the European selection win in the final of Le Golf National unmovable.
I want them both to achieve it in different halls at the same time.
However, the European selection has not yet been decided.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily beat the heroes of the morning's foursome, Sergio Garcia and Alex Nolen.
Garcia and Lennon were unable to save the hole after a bogey and two double bogeyes dug a grave on the first nine holes.
On Sundays, there's no one to help.
Foreball and Forsum are very interesting to watch up close because of the interaction between the two of them, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the momentary changes in strategy.
While the European selection has played better as a team so far and has a big lead going into the final day, this Foursome session showed that the US selection is willing to fight to remove the anxiety that the US side has, especially.
Ryder Cup final day, European selection lead with a 10-6 lead.
The European team leads the United States 10-6 after Saturday's foursome against Forsum, and is well on its way to the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The team of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Morinari, who have shown great performances, have now increased their score to four points at Le Golf National, with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods.
Thomas Bion's European qualifier, aiming to win back the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years earlier, dominated the uncomfortable US qualifier in the morning fours and made the score 3-1.
The U.S. team regained its composure at Forsum, winning two games, but still could not close the gap.
The U.S. team, led by Jim Furyk, needs to score eight points in Sunday's 12 singles games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, and the pair, which became known as "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, became the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed on fours, they showed a wonderful unity and won by scores of 5 and 4, which stood out even more to the discouraged Woods and rookie Bryson Deschamps.
Woods, who was out of form in Saturday's two games, also played well on occasion, but not only lost 19 of his 29 games at Fowler and Forsyth, but also suffered seven consecutive defeats.
After a break in the morning foosball, Justin Rose teamed up with Henrik Stenson at Forsum to defeat world number one and third-ranked Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keppka 2 and 1.
The course in southwest Paris was a good day for the wind, but the European selection did not rule as it should.
Three-time major champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points on Saturday to set the standard for the U.S. team.
They showed their best form in fours, winning 2-1 over John Lamb and Ian Poulter of Spain, and then losing their first two holes at Forsum to Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 on aggregate.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only two times in the past have the United States men's national team reversed from a four-point lead in singles, but only once has the U.S. men's national team, led by Furyk, been able to keep the trophy by drawing it.
But for the two days of the US election, Sunday's counterattack seems to be beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will never unilaterally disarm without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions have increased mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances it will not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Foreign Minister Lee Jong-ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" in the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites and pledging non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see a substantial response from the United States", he said.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we will lose confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm".
While Foreign Minister Lee reiterated the familiar North Korean complaints about the U.S. government's lack of response to North Korea's "phased" denuclearization approach, his statement is significant in that, unlike before, the North Korean government did not immediately reject unilateral denuclearization.
Foreign Minister Lee made reference to the joint statement by Trump pledging North Korean security and promising Kim Jong Un to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" at his first summit with the US president and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The US government also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is opposed to the Declaration of the End of War, which insists on 'non-nuclearisation first' and presses further with sanctions to achieve its objectives by force", Li said.
"The idea that sanctions can bring us down is an illusion for people who don't know us.
But the problem is that our mistrust is being strengthened by the continuation of sanctions".
Lee did not mention plans for Kim's second summit with Trump, which President Trump highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings with Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the denuclearization issue were a Korean issue and not a U.S. one, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have gone so far".
Even so, the tone of Foreign Minister Lee's speech was dramatically different from when Gold called Trump "the evil president" and Trump called Gold "the rocket man" in a suicide bombing campaign, and then said at the UN General Assembly last year that North Korean rockets would inevitably reach the US mainland.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Gold for his courage in his efforts to disarm at the United Nations this year, but said there were many challenges ahead and that sanctions would have to be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had not set a time frame, saying, "It's not going to take two years, three years, five months".
China and Russia have objected to the UN Security Council's response to North Korea's actions.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until it is verified that complete and final denuclearization has been achieved".
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile development.
Pompeo said he had a meeting with Foreign Minister Lee on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, after which he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit was fruitless.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he reported progress, but within hours North Korea accused him of making "gang demands".
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month that it would dismantle its missile and nuclear facilities if the United States took "responsive measures".
He says he told him that the "response" he was seeking was the security that Trump promised in Singapore and a move toward normalizing relations with the US government.
I'm a Harvard student, I'm taking a course on getting enough rest.
This year's new course at Harvard University aims to get all undergraduates to get more sleep to combat the growing macho culture of caffeinated "all-nighter" study.
Harvard students, the world's leading university, are often ignorant of very basic things, like how to manipulate their bodies.
Charles Zeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course. He claims it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He said he came up with the idea to start this course after giving a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
And finally, a girl student came up to me and said, "Why did I have to be in the fourth grade to hear this story?"
I was surprised that no one had ever taught her the importance of sleep", he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was first conducted this year, explains to students how good sleep habits can promote learning and exercise and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health services, says the university decided to introduce the course after recognizing a severe sleep deprivation among students that week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, students can learn about the effects of caffeine and light when clicking on a coffee cup, curtains, sneakers, or book in their dorm room, the effects of sleep deprivation on exercise capacity, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation may promote the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daytime routines.
"I know that the behavior of students will not change instantly.
But they should have a right to know - just as they have a right to know how their choice to smoke affects their health", adds Professor Zuisler.
He also says that the culture of "all-nighter study" still exists and that the problem of sleep deprivation is increasing due to modern technology and increased pressure on students.
Getting enough good quality sleep is a student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, constantly hungry, and prevents weight gain, he says.
Raymond Thor, 19, from California, who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped design his course after taking a class with Professor Zeisler at Harvard University last year as a freshman.
He was awakened by the course and began to think about expanding the course to the entire campus.
The next step he wants to take is to make sure that all graduate students get a similar program before they start studying at a competitive place called Harvard.
Professor Zeisler recommends that students set alarms at bedtime as well as at waking time, and be aware of the effects of harmful "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disturb circadian rhythms and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Mango's goal knocks down the Rangers led by Gerard
The Rangers were again defeated at the Ave. A goal by Livingston's Dory Menga saw Rangers beaten 1-0 by a team that lacked Steven Gerrard.
The Ibrox-based Rangers were aiming for their first away win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gerrard suffered his second defeat in 18 games as manager against Gary Holt's Livingston, leaving Rangers eight points clear of Hearts, who are in first place in the Scottish Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, but then the uninspired Rangers didn't seem to score.
Rangers are currently down to sixth, but Livingston have moved up to third behind Hibernian on points.
Also, the Rangers could face further problems with line referee Kalam Spence having to undergo treatment for a head injury after being thrown from the passenger seat on the away side.
Gerard made eight changes to the team when he broke the air and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Meanwhile, Holt maintained the same eleven he had when he took points from Hearts last week. He must have been pleased that well-trained members had tormented their opponents in every situation.
The Rangers won by ownership, but Livingston was more effective in attacking with less possession.
Just two minutes into the game, midfielder Scott Pittman, from the first pass of the game, scored Alan McGregor's defensive goal, but missed a decisive opportunity by going out of the side.
Then, a free kick from Keegan Jacobs' penalty area was taken by general manager Craig Harket and fired by defender Alan Liskear, but only hit the backpost.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but in the final third they ended up playing with less confidence than they had in the final third.
Colombian Alfred Morelos claimed a penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes, but the referee, Steven Thomson, rejected Morelos' appeal.
The Rangers gave up two shots in the first half, but former Rangers GK Liam Kelly easily saved Lasana Klibari's heading and Obi-Ejelia's monotonous shots.
Livingston's 34-minute lead was against the flow of the game, but no one can deny that it was also a result of hard work.
Here again, the Rangers were unable to handle Jacobs' set piece in the penalty area.
Declan Gallagher passes to Scott Robinson, Robinson calmly passes to Menga, and Menga scores easily, but Scott Arfield can't match that.
Gerard replaced Ryan Kent with Clibari at half-time, but this soon paid off, and winger Clibari passed Morelos, but Kelly came out ahead of the goal line and blocked the ball with a good save.
However, Livingston carried the game in his own style, handling the long balls that Lisgoth and Harkette were sending in turn.
Holt's Livingston had a chance to extend the lead at the end, but Jacobs' shot was blocked by a good save from McCleager and Riscoe's headshot from the next corner went out of the side.
Rangers' Glenn Middleton, who was playing on the way, appealed the penalty when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thompson rejected it again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter.
"Sunday Morning" Almanac page one: 136 years ago today, on September 30, 1882, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually became known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter, a major force in science, has also become a major force in pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film The Coronado Bell starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists.
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
And if you plug in the earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that are released by the radiation in the mineral".
"It's true. It's playing!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" bad cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" and kill the bad cells.
Vaccines are a continuum of treatment that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
This is a method of extracting immune cells from patients and modifying them in the lab.
This allows cells to "discern" proteins common to many cancers and then re-inject them.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results among a wide range of cancer patients.
In the case of women who received vaccines that taught their immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared over 18 months.
This method allows the patient to extract immune cells and modify them in the laboratory to "identify" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, which is then injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzowski of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that the vaccine is effective".
HER2 "promotes the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explains Professor Berzowski.
A similar approach, to remove immune cells from patients and "teach" them how to target cancer cells, has also been shown to be effective in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was on SNL wearing a MAGA cap and shouting for Trump.
That's what gets you bad publicity.
Kanye West was booed for his support for President Donald Trump during his appearance on SNL.
West, wearing a "Make America Great Again" cap, sang the third song of the night, "Ghost Town", and then repeated his support for Trump, including a rant against the Democrats.
"I talked to white people and they said, 'How can you like Trump when he's a racist?'"
But if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago".
The day's SNL began with a dramatic performance starring Hollywood star Matt Damon, who refuted Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault charges by Christine Brazy Ford.
The video of West's allegations was not aired, but was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Locke was trying to mock West with his post.
West also complained to the audience that he had worked behind the scenes for his hat.
"I was bullied in the backstage.
They say, "Don't go out with your hat on".
I was really bullied!
And the Washington Examiner says, "I'm at the bottom of the barrel".
West said, "Do you want to see the bottom?" and then he went on, "I'm going to put on the Superman mantle, because then no one can tell me what to do.
Then you can try love".
His comments caused at least two roars from the audience, and the SNL cast appeared to be confused, Variety reported, with one person at the scene saying: "The whole studio went quiet".
West was asked to replace former rapper Mac Miller, who had died a few days earlier.
West dressed as a periebot and sang "I Love It", which stunned many.
The leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candice Turner, tweeted in support of West: "To the bravest spirit: Thank you for standing up to the mob".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "their thing, very cool".
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone who spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community by buying his music and clothes or supporting his 'art.'"
He's free.
"We are too", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, but he is following in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Pafdadi, Pafi, and P Diddi.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg also goes by the name Snoop Lion, and of course the late music legend Prince changed his name to Symbol after the change, and further to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
He's been charged with attempted murder in a Belfast restaurant.
A man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday and a 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder.
Police say the incident happened in Barrie Hackmore.
On Monday, the accused will appear in Belfast Magistrates Court.
The charges are reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harrington, is attacking a toxic man.
Harrington is best known for his role as swordsman John Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But Kit, 31, attacked this stereotype of a macho hero, saying that because of these screen roles, boys are starting to feel they have to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt "something was wrong" and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Recently married to Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, Kit admitted that she feels "very strongly" about working on the issue.
"I feel very strongly, personally, right now, about what we did wrong with masculinity", he said.
"What have you been teaching your boys growing up about the problems we're facing?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to its highly masculine characters.
He goes on to say, "What is born and what is taught?
Do not boys feel that they must be men with certain qualities because of what they see on television and in the streets?
And I think this is one of the big problems of our time, but how do we change this?
When I look at a young man, it's obvious that something is wrong".
In the interview, he also said that "the battlefield and the horses are over", and admitted that he would not talk about the prequel or sequel after Game of Thrones ended next summer.
In November, she will star in a re-imagining of Sam Shepard's True West.
He recently said that the best part of Game of Thrones was meeting his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on the show, and she gave me my future family and my life in a way", he says.
Rose played John Snow's lover, Igrit, played by Kit, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
They married in June 2018 at their home in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% surge in new cases
China announced that the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, nearly 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases are sexually transmitted, and there have been changes from the past.
In China, HIV spread rapidly in some areas as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But in China, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 over the previous year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In China, where homosexuality was legalized in 1997, discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rampant.
According to surveys, it is estimated that 70 to 90 percent of gay men will eventually marry a woman, due to the country's conservative values.
Many infections occur because of inadequate prevention in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make anti-HIV drugs more widely available as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters, the staff's denial of the leak of data from the Republican senator, accused it of being a "dangerous lie" and a "conspiracy theory".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her staffers posted the personal information of three Republican senators on her Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party claims that the claim is made by "ultra-right" critics and websites.
"Lies, lies, vile lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an anonymous figure on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual assault by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The data leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedState have published information about Waters' employees, with the IP addresses allegedly belonging to Waters' office.
"This baseless claim is a complete and utter lie", Waters continued.
"My staff has been compromised in their identity, privacy and security by these fraudulent and false allegations, but they have nothing to do with the leak".
This unfounded claim is a complete and utter lie".
Waters' statement was immediately criticized online by people including former White House spokesman Ali Frischer.
"This denial is nothing but anger", wrote Frisher.
"This showed that she was not worthy of being a congresswoman".
If you are accused of doing something you did not do, do not be angry.
Do not be arrogant.
You must not question the motives of the accused.
"You must behave calmly and calmly".
Frisher appears to be comparing the criticism of Democrats who said they were too angry about Judge Kavanaugh's behavior at Thursday's hearing to Waters's response.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is seeking Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's amazing if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters says her office "reported these false claims to the authorities and police".
She said, "We will do everything we can to identify the culprit", and stated, "We will hold the culprit legally responsible for his destructive and dangerous behavior on my staff".
"Johnny English, The Analog Reversal" - a parody of the powerless.
Recently, it has become common for new films depicting the decline of Britain to find a Brexit context, but this seems to apply to the sequel to the action comedy Johnny English. The series has so far released 2003's Johnny English and 2011's Johnny English: The Reward of Leisure.
Could this ironic auto-satire on how incompetent we are be a new export opportunity for Britain?
In any case, Johnny English, an incompetent, rubber-faced man with a bulging eye, is repeatedly deranged in this work. His name suggests, above all, that he is a comedy made for non-English-speaking film buffs.
He's, of course, a stupid secret agent who misunderstands his sophisticated charm and acts arrogantly, but he has all the elements of the Clouseau police, Mr Bean, and the character who played only one note of the flame runner theme song at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Johnny English was originally based on the now-forgotten Barclays Card television commercial, in which Atkinson played a mysterious world traveler who causes trouble everywhere.
There are one or two good scenes in this latest film.
A good scene is when Johnny English approaches the helicopter in a medieval slingshot, and the rotor blade hits the helmet and makes a sound.
Atkinson's comedic talents are also shown, but especially given that "serious" films like 007 and Mission: Impossible have become comedic, the humor is rather weak and strangely redundant.
The humor felt more like a child than an adult, and to me, Johnny English's quirky adventures were not as original or focused as the gags in the silent film Mr. Bean, starring Atkinson.
The film is based on the ongoing current theme of Britain having serious problems.
The most senior agent (unfortunately a minor role for Kevin Elton) is stunned when a cyber hacker infiltrates the web network of secret British spies and exposes the identities of all the British agents in the operation.
For an already troubled and disillusioned Prime Minister, the news was beyond the pale. Emma Thompson, who plays this parody of Theresa May, is a good actor, but the script is not very deep.
Her wise advisor says that since the identities of all active spies have been revealed, she can only invite retired spies.
This also includes Johnny English, who works as a principal at a top school and secretly teaches how to become a secret agent. English spy academies like the School of Rock have some interesting gags.
English heads to the White House for a briefing, where he meets his long-suffering former colleague, Ben Miller.
Boff is now married to a submarine commander (a fit and warm-blooded character, perfect for Vicky Pepperdine).
And then the legendary convoy of Her Majesty's Secret Service is resurrected and she meets the beautiful Femme Fatale, Ophelia Britova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being told by charismatic billionaire Jason Volta (Jake Lacy), who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer crisis.
English and Boff cause a number of problems, as before: pretending to be a waiter, starting a fire in a luxury French restaurant, causing a commotion by trying to break into Volta's luxury yacht, and causing a chaos by English using a virtual reality headset to see inside Volta's house.
While all the tricks are definitely on the final stretch, this beloved comedy is generally a children's show.
It's pretty common.
And as I felt in other Johnny English films, the British film industry couldn't help but wonder if they couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is considering a plan to pay the people five days' wages for four days' work a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party appears to be considering a radical plan to pay its citizens five days' pay for four days a week.
The party says it wants corporate management to share the money earned through the AI revolution with workers by increasing wages.
The plan would see employees working three days a week for the same pay.
The source said the idea was in line with the party's economic policy and plans to make the country more favorable to workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
In the Sunday Times, Labour Party officials said: "The policy review is due to be published by the end of the year.
"It is not something that can be done overnight, but the four-day work week is a goal that fits in with the Party's approach to realigning the economy in favour of workers and the Party's overall industrial strategy".
The Green Party has pledged a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign, so this is not the first time the Labour Party has supported the idea.
However, the Labour Party as a whole does not support this goal at present.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not a policy of the Party and the Party has not considered it".
The shadow minister, John McDonnell, at a Labour conference last week, articulated his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the "faceless officers" and "undue profiteers" of the utility companies.
The shadow minister's plan also means that the Labour government could "deduct" the company because it recognised the fraud and the current shareholders of the water company might not be able to recover their entire stake.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on corporate boards, create a comprehensive ownership fund to deposit 10% of the capital of private companies there, and to receive annual dividends of up to £500 for employees.
Lindsay Gramm and John Kennedy talk about whether the FBI might change its mind about the Kavanaugh investigation in "60 Minutes".
The FBI investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising questions about whether the FBI's findings will jeopardize the Senate's support of Republicans.
In an interview aired on Sunday, Scott Perry of 60 Minutes asked Republican senators Lindsay Gramm and John Kennedy if they could find something that would change the FBI's mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague Gram from South Carolina.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
"I told you I was going to the hearing. I told you I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
And after that, after the accusation, I called him and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, he was clear".
But the Gram vote seems unchangeable.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh, and that will be severely criticized", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied it", Gramm added, referring to Christine Brazy Ford.
"And no one who mentioned her name could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I'm not seeing any new changes".
What is the Global Citizens Festival?
This Saturday, New York hosts the annual Global Citizen Festival, a music event that features many of the most impressive stars performing, but equally impressive is their mission to end world poverty.
This year, in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival brings tens of thousands of people to the lawn of Central Park to not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international human rights organization that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to buy a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks or "actions" that involved volunteering, emailing world leaders, making phone calls, or doing something else that would raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But with 12 years to go, how far has the Global Citizens Festival come to achieve that goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert and convincing them to take action a sincere way, or is it another case of cliqueism, where you just sign an online petition or tweet to feel like you've done something meaningful?
Since 2011, Global Citizens has recorded over 19 million "actions" from supporters, and says it is promoting a variety of goals.
These actions have led world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that the funds secured have so far directly affected some 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their fullest potential". The group received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens, pledging to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country.
"With the support of the UK government, fundraisers, governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a thing of the past". Speaking to the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018, Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman said:
The group also said that more than 5,000 actions were taken in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, to provide nutrition support to five million women and children.
And I asked them, "Do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said, "It's going to be a long and difficult road.
But we have power together, and we will succeed, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are the performers at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to blockade Russian energy exports.
The US government can rely on the Navy in areas including the Middle East "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from hitting the market, Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has revealed, the Washington Examiner reports.
Zink argued that Russia's involvement in Syria was an excuse to open up new energy markets, especially if it was acting on behalf of a legitimate government.
"The reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy as much as they do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", he was reported to have said.
According to officials, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States can work with the Navy to ensure that the mermaids are open and block energy from entering the market if necessary", he said.
Zink was speaking at an event organized by the nonprofit Consumers Energy Alliance, which is positioning itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that both companies are virtually the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to replace them, more or less, with fuel", he said, calling Russia an economically dependent fossil fuel "Wantrick Pony".
The statement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to promote the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe as a much cheaper option for European consumers instead of Russia.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is planned to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.
The U.S. stance provoked a German backlash, and Germany reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The BDI, Germany's leading industrial organization, called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"The fact that third countries are interfering with our energy supply is a big problem", Dieter Kemp, president of the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "carefully investigate" her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election, says a Massachusetts senator.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she would "look closely" at presidential candidates after the midterm elections on Saturday.
At City Hall in Holyoak, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
According to Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go into Washington and rebuild a broken government, including putting women at the top".
"From November 6th onwards, I will be closely monitoring the presidential candidates".
Warren joined the debate during the town hall, saying that President Donald Trump "has led this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to democracy", she said.
Warren has been a harsh critic of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think she will run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 58% of "high-probability" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run.
32% supported the candidate.
Polls showed that the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick was more likely to be supported, with 38% supporting the possibility of running and 48% opposed.
Other high-profile Democratic politicians discussing their potential for the 2020 presidential nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin at a rally for Donald Trump, talking about PTSD in Paris.
The 26-year-old Turk Parlin spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested and charged Monday night in a domestic violence case.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through when he comes home, I feel for the other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the wounds that soldiers are carrying when they come home", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Parrin called his arrest "the elephant in the room", and of his son and other war veterans, "they come home a little different, stubborn, wondering if they have enough respect for what their fellow soldiers, pilots, and every other member of the military has given to the country".
According to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, for obstructing reports of domestic violence and possession of a firearm during a robbery and charged with domestic violence against women.
18 states and Washington D.C. support the objection to the new refugee policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have backed legal objections to a new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs and domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed court advisory reports in Washington on Friday, supporting a challenge to the asylum seekers policy, according to NBC News.
The Grace Sessions lawsuit was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, but the plaintiff's full name was not disclosed.
She said she was abused by her partner and "his violent gang members", but US authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence, and that the United States has received a large number of asylum applications.
The new U.S. refugee policy overturned a 2014 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to allow immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum without documentation.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all refugee claims be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such barriers violate that principle", the court counsel's report said.
The secretary also said in the report that immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the labor force they need", while policies that deny them entry hurt the U.S. economy.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration officials no longer give asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to people who leave their home country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in a policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum is not intended to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people around the world face every day.
A desperate rescue operation in Pal, where the death toll has doubled, in the fight to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation became more dire.
"I look very nervous", said Lisa Kusma, a 35-year-old mother, who gave birth to a hot baby boy in a burnt-out palace shelter.
"An ambulance will be here every minute or so.
There's hardly any clean water".
The residents returned to their destroyed houses, collected their flooded belongings and tried to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overcrowded after the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Some of the wounded, including Dewey Harris, who suffered a hip and shoulder injury, were resting outside Paul's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to the continued strong aftershocks.
When he remembered the time when his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter, was shaken by a violent earthquake, tears came to his eyes.
"I didn't have time to run away.
I think I'm caught in a wall that's fallen", Harris told the Associated Press.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then I couldn't hear anything.
I don't know what happened to her and the child.
I hope you're all right".
I'm going to condemn the US ambassador, the Chinese for using "advertising" to "bully".
A week after the Chinese state newspaper published a four-page ad in the American daily, promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the two countries, the Chinese ambassador to the United States accused Beijing of using the American newspaper for propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, but denied it, and then referred to a paid ad in the Chinese Daily in Iowa's largest newspaper, the Des Moines Register.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election showed that it was a new phase in Washington's campaign to put increasing pressure on China, as US officials told Reuters.
While promoting trade is commonplace for foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently in the midst of an expanding trade war, imposing equal tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs in the early days of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican-led administration, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China's Branstad wrote in the comments section of the Demoin Register on Sunday that "the aggression of propaganda ads against press freedom in our country is intensifying".
Branstad says that "the Chinese government is using the free speech and freedom of the press, which are important American traditions, to its own advantage by publishing paid notices in the Demon Register to spread propaganda".
"In contrast, here in Beijing, on the newsstands along the roadside, you see only limited dissent, and you don't see anything that truly reflects the different opinions that the Chinese people might have about China's chaotic economic trajectory.
He added: "One of the most prominent newspapers in China has avoided publishing my article. But it has avoided mentioning which newspaper specifically".
Analysts warn that the uproar over Mr. Kavanaugh will further drive women voters away from the Republican Party ahead of the midterm elections.
Many Republican leaders have come to the defense of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over multiple sexual assault allegations. Analysts warn that the Republican Party will face backlash from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The riot caused very strong emotions; most Republicans are said to already be hoping to go to the polls.
In an article published Saturday in The Hill, Grant Leiler, professor of political science at Lacus Maxell University, said "we cannot go back and verify facts".
Professor Leiler said it was doubtful that Senator Jeff Flake's push for an FBI investigation at the brink of election would be enough to appease voters.
According to a Washington DC newspaper, on Friday, Carine Jean Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group Movement, said, "Women don't forget yesterday's events, they don't forget tomorrow's events.
On Friday morning, demonstrators outside the Senate shouted, "November is coming!" at the Republican leadership of the Judiciary Committee for choosing to advance the nomination of Cabanera despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Bresley Ford.
Nonpartisan political analyst Steve Rosenberg told the news site that "the enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be unmatched".
"This is a high-end, but it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among urban, nonpartisan women voters and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who have generally low voter turnout, but who have no good opinion of the president".
Analysts suggest that a backlash could ensue if the Republican approval is granted, in the face of public testimony that Mr. Ford was sexually assaulted by a Supreme Court nominee.
According to NBC News, Michael Southey, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said last week, "This riot is causing a terrible mess in the GOP".
Guy Cecil, a Democratic campaign aide, told the news channel that "the issue is not just the committee vote or the final vote on whether or not Mr. Cabaner is appointed. The issue is how the Republicans handle this uproar and how they handle her".
However, the American public is divided as to which of Mr. Ford's and Mr. Cabanner's testimony should be believed, and one seems to be in the majority.
According to a survey by Yugava, 41% of respondents said they absolutely/probably believe Ford's testimony, compared to 35% for Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38% said that Mr. Kavanaugh was probably/absolutely lying in his testimony, compared to 30% for Mr. Ford.
At the urging of Mr. Flake, the FBI is also investigating another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, who has testified against Mr. Ford, the Guardian reports.
Mr. Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that he was assaulted by a drunken Mr. Cabanner when he was 17.
Mr. Ramirez also testified that a Supreme Court nominee had exposed his genitals while attending a party at Yale in the 1980s.
He's the inventor of the World Wide Web, and he's planning to start a new Internet that replaces Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, started a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project by legendary technology entrepreneur Lee, based on the open source platform Solid by Berners Lee.
Solid gives users the choice of where their data is stored and who can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast, Barnes Lee joked that the hidden intent of Inrupt was "world domination".
And he says, "This is what we need to do right now".
"This is a historic moment".
The app allows you to create your own personal online data store (POD) using Solid's technology.
This includes contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is available from a single browser, like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify.
The unique feature of personal online data stores is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what information.
Inrupt calls it "the empowerment of the individual through data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and appropriate skills for everyone to use Solid.
Inrupt is currently composed of developers and volunteer coders from Berners-Lee, Bruce, and IBM, who have been contracted to develop security platforms and projects.
Starting this week, developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lee says that he and his team are talking about "a complete change in the business model of Facebook and Google that will be overnight".
"I'm not asking them for permission".
In a press release on Saturday, Berners Lee said of Inrupt: "Our mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that ensures the integrity and quality of the new Web built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT, which revolutionized the Internet.
Mr. Berners Lee has been making influential statements in the debate over net neutrality over the past few months.
Even as he continues to launch Inrupt, Mr. Berners-Lee retains his position as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next generation of the web", added Mr. Barnes Lee.
Bernard Van: There's a ceremony to honor the Victorian Clergy of the First World War.
As a fighter, he was associated with the only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War, and a celebration was held in his hometown just 100 years later.
Reverend Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van was awarded the Medal of Honor on September 29, 1918 for his actions at the Battle of Berenguer and at Le Coq.
He did not know, however, that he was killed by a sniper four days later, and was awarded the highest honour of the British Army.
On Saturday, a parade was held in Rushden, Northamptonshire, and a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said the monument was "incredibly symbolic" and was only 100 years old when his grandfather was awarded the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led a battalion through the Canal de Saint-Cant "in the thick fog and the fierce fire of the front and machine-gun fire".
Then, with great courage, he rushed to the front line of fire, with a small gun in one hand, pushed back the front line, and shot down three divisions.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said of his grandfather's behavior: "It's not something I can emulate, but it's also humiliating".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, held a grand celebration after the parade, led by the Brentwood Royal Youth Band.
Michael Van said, "It was a great honor to be part of the parade". He added, "The courage of a true hero was demonstrated by the support of so many".
All I saw was a bunch of MMA fans and a bunch of little pigs who had been up all night watching the Berato 206.
Imagine how it would feel to miss the main event, despite having spent the night trying to see the Beratour 206.
The San Jose Building was composed of 13 episodes; six of the main card episodes were broadcast on Channel 5 in the UK at night.
At 6am, while Mr. Gagar Musashi and Mr. Rory McDonald were preparing for the match, the broadcast switched to Peppa Pig. This also surprised the British viewers.
The audience, who had been up all night, was especially disappointed.
One fan tweeted about his involvement in the children's show, "Some kind of bad joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Berator, said, "At 6 a.m., it seems that we had to switch to a children's show because of government regulations that said martial arts was not suitable for viewing".
"Well, if it's a pepper pig, it's all right with me".
The president of Beratole, Scott Cocker, said he would consider adjusting the schedule to take into account UK viewers in the future.
"I think we'll be fine by the time we get back on the air", Cocker said.
"But it was Sunday morning at six o'clock, so I couldn't adjust it to this Sunday, Monday in the UK.
We're in the process of adjusting it.
When the broadcast was switched, there were a lot of texts going around.
I tried to restore it to its original state.
But it wasn't. It was a government issue.
I can promise you this won't happen in the next show.
We're going to try to reduce the number of games from six to five.
This was an unfortunate situation".
I was feeling inferior about Tom Daley, about sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daly grew up feeling inferior to others in terms of sexuality, but that became his motivation for success.
The 24-year-old athlete didn't realize he was different from the kids around him until he was in high school.
On a Radio 4 Desert Island disc hosted by Lauren Laverne, Dale spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
The longtime regular presenter of the show, Kirsty Young, had not appeared on the show for several months due to illness.
Appearing as a cast away on Laverne's first show, Daly said he felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, feelings of inferiority and alienation have always been real, and they have given me the strength and the strength to succeed".
He says he wanted to prove to himself that he "had some value"; he didn't want to disappoint anyone if his sexuality was revealed one day.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a powerful LGBT campaigner. This year, she appeared at the Commonwealth Games in Australia and appealed to more countries to legalize homosexuality.
The athlete said she was lucky to be able to live her life without being hindered by being open about her sexuality and that she spoke up to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said she fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black. She said she was "surprised" when she met him in 2013.
She married Oscar winner Black, who was 20 years her senior. However, she says the age difference is not a problem at all.
"I have experienced a lot since I was very young". Dale, who made his Olympic debut at 14, lost his father to cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June. Their son, Robert Ray Black Daly, said that "all my values" changed with his birth.
"If you asked me about this last year, I would have said that winning the gold medal was everything".
"But there's something more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, the Olympic gold medal is the lobby".
He took over the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
The player said that his father could not accept his death. One of his last words was, "Have you got tickets for the 2012 London Games yet?"
"I couldn't tell you that I was no longer in this world when I was in the front row", he says.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing", she says. "He stopped breathing, and when he died, I realized for the first time that he was not invincible".
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning a bronze medal.
"I thought at that moment, this is all I wanted in life. I thought there was no greater feeling than diving in front of my home crowd at the Olympics", he says.
The experience also inspired the first selection of Dale's songs. Heather Small's "Proud" resonates with his growth process on his way to the Olympics.
This is Desert Island Disc, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 UK time.
In the Ryder Cup on Saturday, the uncomfortable Mickelson is on the bench.
American Phil Mickelson is trying to set a new record in Sunday's 47th Ryder Cup match. But he needs to re-evaluate his form so that this does not end in disaster.
Mickelson, who was attempting to set a record of 12 appearances in the biennial event, was ordered off the bench by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fours and forehands.
Mickelson, a five-time major champion, has been noticed in many competitions in the United States. This time, he leaves that role to support and participate in the competition.
For him, this is the pinnacle of his career, but the driver is not perfectly straight. The 48-year-old Mickelson is not in the ideal condition to challenge at Le Golf National. On this course, a long-graph leads to a miss-shot.
The course itself is rough, but in the ninth game on Sunday, he will face British Open champion Francesco Morinari. Morinari is teaming up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the United States starts 12 singles matches with a four-point deficit, it will be a heated battle from the start, and Mickelson's match will be decisive.
Mr. Furyk said he had confidence in Mickelson, but he didn't say much else.
"He understood his role well enough today", Furyk says. "He patted my back and shoulder, and told me I was ready for tomorrow".
"I think I have enough confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's made a huge contribution to the team in the past.
I never imagined that he would play two games.
I thought I'd play more, but I've made these adjustments.
I want him to be more involved, just like everybody else".
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup appearances on Sunday.
This may mark the end of Mickelson's Ryder Cup career; his previous performance has never matched his personal best.
Mickelson's record is 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws. However, Furyk says his presence brings a spiritual base to the team.
"He's funny, he's cynical, he likes to give people a little something.
"This week, I think the young players are enjoying working with him.
He brings more than play".
And I'm not going to say that I'm not going to be a big fan of the idea of a big lead.
European captain Thomas Bion has experienced firsthand that even if he is in the lead at the start of the Ryder Cup final day singles, the situation can change.
Bion, a Danish, made his debut at Valderrama in 1997. The team, led by Seve Barresteros, had a five-point lead over the United States, but won the game by a margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
After seeing the 2018 team win 5-3 at Le Golf National on Friday and lead 10-6 yesterday, remember that he was "in a big lead at Bardelema.
This history shows me and my team that we are not done yet.
So I'm going to be all in tomorrow.
I just go out there and do what I have to do.
The game is not over until the score is shown.
We have a goal, and that is to win a trophy.
I've been saying this for a long time, but I'm very enthusiastic about the 12 players on my team, but I know what kind of players they are. They're the best players in the world".
Expressing his joy at his team's performance on the challenging golf course, Bayonne adds: "We never try to brag.
Tomorrow has tomorrow's enemy.
Tomorrow, we're going to see a performance by an individual, and we're going to have a different element.
It's great to be with your teammates when things are going well, but in a one-on-one match, all your qualities as a golfer are tested.
We have to get this message out to all our players, and we're going to do our best tomorrow.
This time he must separate himself from his fellows; his fellows must do their best".
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk aims to make the players he coaches more individual than team. The exceptions are Jordan Spies and Justin Thomas, who have scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has had experience of taking both sides of the final day of the fateful outcome. In the past, his team had led the way on the Brookline, but the European team was ultimately defeated by the "Miracle of Medina".
When asked about the 1999 captain, Ben Crenshaw, when he called the players for the final day, he said, "I remember one sentence clearly".
"There are 12 important games tomorrow, but we expect a rapid development like we saw in Brookline and Medina to start early.
And then you're going to have a lot of pressure in the middle.
We've been strategizing for the situation, we've been intuitively selecting people, and we're going to do a miracle tomorrow".
Thomas is given a promotion and will face Rory McIlroy in the top match. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Lamb, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will also face the top European players in the rankings.
"I put the players in this order because I think they'll be better able to get through the whole thing", Beyoncé explained about singles.
New German military, and a delay.
The German Navy planned to upgrade its now-obsolete Cold War-era warship to the latest frigate in 2014, but due to systemic problems and the rising cost, the prospect of that could not be realised until at least next year, local media reported.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman, the commissioning of the lead ship of the newest Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, the Rhineland-Palatinate, has been extended until the first half of 2019.
The warship was scheduled to be launched in 2014, but problems ensued after delivery and the ambitious plans largely went to hell.
The Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, ordered by the Navy in 2007, are being used by the military to replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
The Baden-Württemberg-class frigates are characterized by powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and stealth technology such as radar, infrared signals and acoustic signals.
Other important features include a long maintenance cycle. It is possible to send the same frigate to a location far from the home port for up to two years.
However, the daily newspaper Die Zeit notes that the latest warships, which are expected to play a key role in Germany's demonstration of military power abroad, will be obsolete by the time they actually enter service, as delays in the plans continue.
The troubled F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to start it and handed it back to the Blohm-Un-Foss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a warship to a shipbuilding company after delivery.
Details of the reasons behind the return are unclear, but German media have cited information that the warship was found to have multiple serious "software and structural defects" that made it unsuitable for combat duty.
The software flaw is particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates are manned by about 120 sailors, half the manpower required for the Bremen-class a generation ago.
The Baden-Württemberg class frigates are also very heavy, and their performance will be impaired, limiting future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate weighed twice as much as the ships of its class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to structural flaws, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, has also emerged as a problem.
The total cost of the project is said to have ballooned from the original 22 billion euros to 31 billion euros ($36 billion).
Recently, there have been warnings that the German Navy is weakening, and the issue of this latest frigate is of great importance.
As of this year, the German parliamentary defense commissioner Hans-Peter Bertels admits that the navy is actually "lacking a warship with the capacity to deploy".
The chairman said that the problem has become more serious over time as the old warships are being discontinued and there are no replacements.
The Chairman also expressed regret that the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates would not be introduced into the Navy at all.
The National Trust, the bat mystery.
A new study, conducted on a site in the Scottish Highlands, aims to uncover how bats use the terrain to prey.
The study is expected to provide new information about the behavior of this unique flying mammal and contribute to future conservation efforts.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, tracks common bats, sopranopipistrels, brown-eyed bats and dormant bats in Invervegetable Gardens in Westeros.
They install dedicated recorders at key points within the site and track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also carry out mobile surveys using portable detectors.
All recorded sounds are analyzed by experts to determine the frequency of the calls the bat makes and what species are doing.
Based on the analysis, habitat maps and reports will be produced, and the bats' behavior will be detailed according to the terrain.
NTS conservation advisor Rob Dwyer hopes the study will shed light on where the most important habitats for bats are and how those habitats are used by various species.
This information can be useful in determining the merits of habitat management activities, such as how to establish habitats for bats and related species and implement forest protection.
In Scotland and throughout the UK, bat populations have declined significantly over the past 100 years.
Bats are threatened with extinction due to construction and habitat loss that affects the conditions of the trees.
In addition to the chemical processing of paper and building materials used for insect control, attacks from pet cats, and windmills and lighting are also risks to bats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, bats are nocturnal and tend to rely more on hearing than sight for their prey activities.
Bats use their advanced feedback locating capabilities to pick up insects at pinpoints and recognize obstacles on flight paths.
The NTS, which manages 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and assets in excess of 76,000 hectares of domestic land, takes bats very seriously.
The NTS has 10 experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect bat seedbeds, and sometimes protect bats.
NTS also has the first bat sanctuary in Scotland at the Sleeve Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate's manager, David Thompson, says the land is an ideal environment for bats.
"This sleeve is the best place for bats", he says.
"There are old buildings here, and there are many old trees, and all of these are part of the bat's habitat.
But there's still so much we don't know about bats, that the activities here and elsewhere can help us understand what it takes for bats to reproduce".
He says it is important to identify bats before carrying out conservation work on the land, as accidentally destroying even one of the bat's nursery trees can kill up to 400 female and young bats and could lead to the extinction of the bat on the land.
Bats are designated as protected animals and it is illegal to kill, abuse, interfere with or cut down any trees.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a member of the Scottish branch of the Bat Conservation Trust, is asking for support from the local community.
He said, "There's still a lot to learn about the Scottish bats, and we really don't know how they behave".
Ronaldo denies rape charges, and his lawyer is ready to sue the magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has denied the rape allegations against him as "false" and says the plaintiffs are using his name "just to promote themselves".
Mr. Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel for publishing the allegations.
The Portuguese forward from Juventus is accused of raping an American woman named Kathleen Mayolga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Mr. Ronaldo is also suspected of handing the woman $375,000 and asking her to make a deal that the case never happened, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after the news broke, Ronaldo, 33, called the news "fake news" in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is not a game".
"The news that the magazine reported today is fake news", said Ronaldo, who has won the Ballon d'Or five times in the past.
"The magazine wants to use my name to promote themselves.
It's not uncommon.
They want to put my name out there and make their magazine more popular.
I'm fine, I'm fine at all", he added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, and have criticized the magazine for "an unacceptable reporting of speculation in the privacy space".
According to lawyer Christian Schultz, Ronaldo is charging a "comfort fee commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years".
The whirlwind incident allegedly occurred in a suite at the Las Vegas Palm Hotel and Casino in 2009.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayalga allegedly went to Ronaldo's room after meeting at a nightclub, where he raped Mayalga's vagina.
Mayolga said that Ronaldo knelt after the incident and said he was "99%" "good" and "betrayed" by the "bad" part of the "1%".
According to the document, Ronaldo admitted to having a sexual relationship between the two, but said it was consensual.
Mayolga also said that she went to the police and had her wounds photographed in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and "fearful of being publicly humiliated".
Mayolga, 34, is now seeking to withdraw the settlement because of the ongoing trauma of the case he is accused of.
Ronaldo was in the midst of a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the incident, and has moved to Italian giants Juventus for €1 million this summer.
The UK will regret forever the loss of its car industry.
Business Secretary Greg Clarke said Britain would "regret forever" losing its position as the world's leading carmaker to Brexit.
The minister also said he was "concerned" that Toyota had told the BBC that it would suspend production at its Barnaston plant if the UK left the EU without an agreement.
Clark, the Secretary of Commerce, said, "We need an agreement".
The Japanese carmaker says that if Brexit passes without an agreement, delays at the border will cause losses to its business.
The Orlis and Avensis are manufactured at Toyota's Barnaston plant, and 90% of the 150,000 vehicles produced last year were exported to countries outside the UK and the European Union.
Marvin Cook, head of Toyota's Barnaston plant, said: "If the UK is forced to leave the EU at the end of March, production at the plant will stop".
Honda, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and other UK carmakers have also expressed concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has announced that it will close its "mini" plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The central concern of carmakers is the supply chain risks that could arise in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for order-made vehicles.
The car industry says that if the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, it could lead to delays at the border and delays or shortages in parts arriving.
Toyota claims that it is impossible to maintain more than a day's worth of stock in its Derbyshire plant, and therefore production will be halted.
Clarke said Prime Minister May's "Checkers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "sophisticated to avoid border checks that the industry is concerned about".
"We need a consensus, which means we want the best possible consensus not only to enjoy the success of today, but to make this an opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers are showing that we need to be able to fully maintain the supply chain that has been so well functioning up to now".
Toyota has not said how long the shutdown will last, but it believes that in the long run, additional costs will reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately affect employment.
Peter Tsouvarris, who has worked at Barnaston for 24 years and is a union representative at the plant, said there was growing concern among union members: "In my experience, if I lose this job, I will never apply again.
A government spokesman said: "The government is presenting a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU".
"Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be postponed". White House.
A planned high-level meeting between President Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rob Rosenstein may be postponed "for another week" because of the ongoing dispute over Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Agent Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties to Trump's inner circle and obstruction of justice by the president.
The recent months have seen a lot of attention from around Washington about whether President Trump's change of Attorney General will affect Mr. Mora's independence.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been wearing a device to record conversations with Trump, suggesting that the president could be impeached under the 25th Amendment.
Mr. Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House and reportedly announced his intention to resign.
It was announced that a meeting with President Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, would be held on Thursday.
President Trump said he "wouldn't want to do it if I could", but the meeting with Rosenstein was postponed after a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing overlapped with the scheduled one. At the hearing, Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blazy Ford, one of the women who has accused him of harassment, gave testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Cabaner, which would delay the Senate vote even further.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, was interviewed by Fox News on Saturday.
When asked about the meeting with Mr. Rosenstein, she said: "The schedule is not over yet. It could be this week.
And that's what we're going to see in the future, and I always want to keep you updated with the latest news in our press releases".
Some reporters will disagree: Sanders has not given a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings is not because she dislikes the "stand play" of TV reporters.
The report suggests that there will be more opportunities for Mr. Trump to have direct contact with the press.
He also said that "President Trump is spending more time answering questions than any president before him", but he never showed any evidence: "We actually verify that number".
While briefings will continue to be held, Sanders said, "If the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it would be better than asking me".
"We've been working hard to do this, and you know we've been doing a lot of that over the last few weeks, and if we can create an opportunity to talk to the president of the United States, it's a replacement for a press briefing".
Trump is a good question-taker when he leaves the White House to attend public meetings and press conferences.
However, a one-man press conference is rare.
The reason for this is evident from the president's nature, which is to be seen in his free-flowing speech in New York this week and his sometimes unnatural appearances in front of a gathering of reporters.
The Secretary of State for Health, Insurance and Pensions has published a letter to Scottish NHS workers from the EU who are worried about Brexit.
The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care has expressed national gratitude to EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland and his wish that they will remain in the same role after Brexit.
Six months before Britain leaves the EU, MEP Jean Freema has published a letter.
The Scottish Government has pledged to provide EU citizens already working in government-developed public services with something that matches the costs of applying for permanent residence.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "The UK and EU have been negotiating a delay in the withdrawal process this summer, and are expected to reach a conclusion this autumn.
But the British government is also considering the possibility of a Nordirl scenario and is preparing for it.
I'm sure this is a very uncomfortable time for you.
So, again, I want to tell you that I think the contributions of all our staff, regardless of nationality, are very valuable.
Our colleagues from across the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and technology to improve the functioning of health services and contribute to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and I hope you will stay here.
Christian Abacrombie, head injury, needs emergency surgery.
Tennessee Tiger linebacker Christian Abachromby suffered a head injury and underwent emergency surgery Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
According to Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed, the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and fell", says Reed.
The coach and medical staff performed oxygen inhalation on the side line before putting the Abacronym player on the stretcher and transporting him on a stretcher for further examination.
A Tennessee State Press release told WSMV's Chris Harris that the Auburn Colombian had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.
Harris added that "we don't yet know the details of the type/severity of the injury". Tennessee is starting an investigation into when the injury occurred.
This was the first season in Tennessee for the redshirt sophomore, after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five tackles before he was ejected from the game, making him 18th on the season.
And that's why we're going to be paying the stamp duty and the increase in the tax on foreign buyers of British property.
Foreign buyers pay higher stamp duty when buying UK property. The proceeds are used to help the homeless under the newly devised Tory plan.
Corbyn has succeeded in attracting young votes, but this move is expected to counter this.
The stamp duty increase is aimed at people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Revenue Office expects to generate up to £120 million a year in revenue, which will be used to support the homeless.
Prime Minister Theresa May announced today that foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying UK property, with the proceeds going to help the homeless.
Jeremy Corbyn has succeeded in winning the youth vote, but this move is seen as an attempt to counter his forces by promising to tax the upper class while increasing the supply of affordable housing.
The stamp duty surcharge is levied on individuals and corporations who do not pay taxes in the UK. The proceeds are used to strengthen the government's response to street people.
The tax increase is in addition to the current stamp duty, which is up to 3% higher. Two years ago, an increase was introduced for second homes and rental housing.
The Revenue Agency projects that this will generate a revenue of £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-EU residents. This has driven up house prices and made it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to buy a home.
Wealthy areas in the UK, especially the capital, are becoming "ghost towns" due to the increase in foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new policy was announced a week after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused big construction companies of taking land to keep house prices high and urged May to remove the cap on affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing problem".
Corbyn has announced a series of proposals that have attracted attention as housing reform, including curbing rents and eliminating the "no-holds-barred" drive.
He also wants to give Congress stronger authority to build new homes.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year, I said that I would work to rebuild the British Dream through my role as Prime Minister.
This is also about fixing our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not a good thing that people living in the UK are working hard and that non-UK residents and foreign companies can easily buy a home.
For many people who dream of owning a home, it's a distant dream, and the neglect of the dignity of the homeless remains a very real problem".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate dream is to be the manager of the Scotland team".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross has said that his "ultimate dream" is to manage the Scotland team one day.
The Scotland international, who is currently No. 42, is trying to revive the North East club. They are currently third in League One, three points behind the top-flight.
He led St. Milan to the Scottish Premiership last season and moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I'm not going to be able to do it, but I'm going to do it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"When I was a kid, I grew up watching my father and the Scottish team in Hamden.
"This is an opportunity that cannot be had unless the club is managed successfully".
Before Ross, Sunderland's managers included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Ardace, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gustavo Poje and Paolo Di Carnio. He was also the manager of the club's youth team.
He is also a former boss of Alloa Athletic and says he is not afraid to be associated with celebrities at such a famous club. He has been denied a move by Barnsley and Ipswich Town in the past.
"My success now depends on getting this club back to the Premier League.
"The club is a great organisation and the facilities are definitely the Premier League", he said.
"It's never easy to get there, but unless you get the club back there, you probably won't be successful".
Ross has only been a manager for three years, but he has 15 months experience as an assistant boss at Dunbarton and as a coach on the Hearts' coaching staff.
He then brought Alloa back from relegation to third place and led St. Milan to the championship title the following season, after being on the verge of relegation.
Ross says he is more relaxed now than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Milan and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real turning point in my life", she says of the time when she received her Aloe.
"I really thought the management was more for me than the players.
And I was doing a good job as a player, so this might seem strange, but I was earning a little bit, I was doing a little bit of something.
But playing is tough.
There's a lot of stuff I have to do every week.
And I think that's the same thing in terms of stress and pressure, but management seems to be working for you.
I've always wanted to be in management, and now I'm in it. I've never been more myself since I was an adult".
The interview is broadcast on Sport Sound on 30 September at 12:00 GMT.
Research has shown that the best time to drink is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
British pubs are struggling with operating difficulties, but the effects of the summer heat are delaying sales.
According to the survey, sales in July increased by 2.7% in pubs and 4.8% in restaurants.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, who summarised the survey results, said: "The strong sunny days continued and the UK's longer than expected World Cup campaign made July essentially the same as June. Pubs rose 2.8% but it was a further blow for restaurants.
Restaurant business fell 1.8 percent in June, but it was even harder in July.
In terms of the same period last year, the pubs and bars with drinks as their main commodity are the most favorable in Dantitz. This is larger than the restaurant's lower width.
Even pubs, whose main commodity is food, are not as bad as restaurants, but they are suffering from the intensity of the sun.
Thank you, people are going out for a drink.
Sales of drinks in the jointly-owned pubs and bars increased by 6.6% compared to the previous month, but food sales fell by 3%".
Paul Newman, a leisure hospitality analyst at RSM, says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and large social/sporting events are major factors that affect the sales of the outdoor food industry.
It's no surprise that the restaurant group's running problems continue, but it will be especially painful to see sales fall 4.8% year-on-year as cost pressures persist.
The long summer heat has come at a very bad time for the businessmen whose main commodity is food. It will be seen whether the mildness of the temperatures since the beginning of August will bring the long-awaited relief".
Sales in July, including new openings, for pubs and restaurants overall increased by 2.7%. This reflects the slowdown in the brand's expansion.
Caffe Peach Trackers monitors industrial sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sectors, collecting and analysing performance data from 47 business groups. The network's total turnover is £9 billion and it is a prominent benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has a social media account hidden from their parents.

One mother says she accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, and found her posting "rape" to others.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40% of pupils aged 11-18 had two profiles, one of which was a secret account.
Mike Buchman, chief executive of HMC, said: "I'm shocked to see that many teenagers want to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
I'm the voice of the athlete in the Scottish Athletic Commission.
At the general meeting of the governing body of the Scottish Athletic Commission, player Eli Doyle was elected as a non-executive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty said the decision would be a good opportunity for those in the sporting community to use her experience of the last decade at a wide international level.
"Ailey is highly respected by the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are confident that by electing her to the committee, the Scottish athletic community will benefit immensely", he said.
Doyle said: "I want to be a serious voice for athletes, and I want to contribute to the sport in Scotland and help keep it going".
An American man who won four Olympic gold medals, including the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Athens Olympics, and now regularly appears as a pundit on the BBC, suffered a single, transient cerebral haemorrhage and was unable to walk.
He tweeted: "One month ago today, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said that he would not know how much he would recover until time passed.
It was a very rough road, but I've fully recovered and I can walk again.
Thank you so much for your encouraging messages!"
And the advertisement for the milk machine that made the mother look like a cow.
The manufacturer of the milking machine has published an advertisement that depicts a dairy cow milking her mother, and online opinions are divided.
Consumer technology company Elby released an ad inspired by a comic music video to announce the world's first silent wearable milk pump. The intention of the ad was to depict the liberation of a breastfeeding mother by this new breast pump.
Four real mothers dancing in a cowshed, covered in silk, singing a song with the lyrics: "I'm sucking myself, but I'm not sucking a tail". "You may not have noticed, but it's not the cow's breast, it's my breast".
The chorus continues: "I suckle, I suckle, I suckle the baby. I suckle, I suckle, I suckle the human woman".
The ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of comments. Viewers' responses have been mixed. Many of them said the advert exposed the dairy industry to "terrorism" in broad daylight.
"The use of dairy cows in advertising this product is a gross misjudgment.
Like us, dairy cows have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk. The difference is that cows are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth".
The Elby's suction machine fits in the inside of the Elby/Mother breast-feeding bra.
Other comments state: "Of course, this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
Why use a cow when a human mother can't take her baby away?"
And one person added, "What an amazing ad".
Some people defend this ad. One woman says that the song "made me laugh".
"I think it was a genius idea.
I think I'd use it myself if I was still breastfeeding.
When you suck milk, you really feel like a cow.
I'm convinced the ads are a little crazy.
And some people said, "This is a great product".
Another commented: "This is a funny ad for moms who are breastfeeding and think they look like cows".
It's not a commercial that praises or criticizes the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the dancing women show off their pumps hidden in their bras.
The campaign concept is inspired by the fact that many breastfeeding women say they look like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits in a breast-feeding bra so that women can move freely, hold their babies, and even go outside while breastfeeding.
Mother's partner and ECD's Anna Ballarin said: "The Elvie Pump is an innovative product, so I think it was a good idea to have a bold and stimulating marketing campaign.
By comparing the female expression with that of a cow, the aim was to draw attention to breastfeeding and all its problems, and to show in a funny way the surprisingly free feeling that new breastfeeding brings.
This is not the first time Elvie Pump has been the subject of a major media coverage.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two with this product appeared on the runway with designer Marta Jacobuski.
They're secretly moving hundreds of immigrant children into tents and camps on the Texas border.
The number of immigrants crossing the border in one month was relatively unchanged, but the number of detained immigrant children soared. This is partly because of the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies that made it difficult to entrust children to guardians.
Until now, most of the guarantors have been illegal immigrants themselves, who have been afraid of risking their own stay by filing for children.
The risk increased when federal authorities announced that in June, the surety and other adults in the family would be required to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Alvens testified before Congress that he had arrested dozens of people who had applied for unaccompanied minor bail.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are guarantors or family members of guarantors are in the country illegally, and most of them are foreigners with criminal records".
"We are continuing to track such individuals", Alvens said.
According to camp workers, in order to process the children's applications quickly, the authorities introduced a new rule requiring some to appear in court within a month of their detention, instead of the previous standard of 60 days.
Many will appear in court via video call and file a legal status claim with an immigration judge instead of appearing in person.
Those deemed ineligible for bail shall be forcibly deported immediately.
According to reports from camp workers and insiders in recent months, prolonged detention of children makes them more likely to become anxious and depressed, and as a result, violent and escape attempts.
Advocates said that the size of large facilities like Tornio has raised concerns that signs of difficulties facing children are being overlooked.
He added that moving a child into a tent without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare and say goodbye to their friends could worsen the trauma they are already suffering.
Syria has ordered the US occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called for Syrian refugees to return home despite the country's eight-year civil war.
Muallem, who is the deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops are illegally present in Syria under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "they will be dealt with accordingly".
"We must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he said.
Muallem claimed that the "war on terror is almost over" after 360,000 people were killed and millions displaced since 2011.
Syria said it would continue this holy war until terror groups and "illegal aliens" were "eradicated from all Syrian territory".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly for training and instruction of the Kurdish forces fighting President Bashar al-Assad and Syrian Arabs.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem accuses "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that refugees should stay abroad, even though there is no problem with the conditions of their return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to encourage the return", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be purely humanitarian issues".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not support the reconstruction of Syria until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
A UN diplomat said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel base in Idlib had created an opportunity to advance political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a major attack by the Russian-backed Syrian army on the province of 3 million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and stated that military action would target jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, "with the aim of eliminating them".
UN Special Envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members soon, draft a post-war Syrian constitution and hold elections.
Muallem presented conditions for the Syrian government to join the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump is reelected.
According to that logic, unless Trump is re-elected in 2020 unless he is ousted early from office by impeachment and scandal, as many liberal viewers probably hope.
It will be the most dramatic presidential funeral ever.
So far, there's no sign of the audience getting tired.
Since 2014, the Golden Hour has more than doubled in viewership at CNN to 1.05 million, and at MSNBC to nearly three times that of 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News's average audience for Golden Hour has grown to 2.4 million from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" has the highest cable channel audience of any major nightly news program at 3.5 million.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, and it's not understandable", said Neil Beara, a show runner on the ABC drama "Survivor: The Fate of the Furious", which stars a cabinet minister who becomes president after the capital is destroyed by an attack.
Veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, Nell Scobel, has a different view.

She asked why.
"The driver said, 'Because he makes you laugh,'" Scobel told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other television shows, the story lines that emerge from the American administration determine the future of the Law v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can be reunited, the health of the global economy, and so on.
Ignoring is a luxury only given to the most privileged viewers.
Yet when I watch a panel of experts debate for a long time about the impact of the use of "deep background" in Bob Woodward's book "FEAR", Paul Manafort's $15,000 goose-skin bomb jacket, and Stormy Daniels' harsh, anatomical explanation of Trump, I go beyond informed citizens.
Personally, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of his behavior that makes it feel like a reality show is that he provides something to talk about every day", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of Pawn Stars, about the script that unfolds in the cast and day shift of Trump's show (taking up the fight with the NFL and praising Kim Jong-un).
I can't miss the episode I forgot.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kaua'i, and he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN in his house.
He couldn't leave when Brett Kavanaugh was testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.

The House of Representatives midterm elections are expected to be a close one.
It's no surprise that congressional redistricting has brought money to Pennsylvania's 17th District, where two incumbents are vying for the same seat.
The recently reorganized district, a suburb of Pittsburgh, is being contested by Democratic Congressman Connor Ramm, who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
The candidate against Mr. Ram is former Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Keith Rothfuss, who is running for the 12th District seat, which overlaps significantly with the new 17th District.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old district was illegally favoring the Republicans, and the districts were reorganized.
The new 17th District campaign has been a fierce battle over funding from the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC), a major political party fundraising organization, and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Mr. Ram won a special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District in March, which drew attention, and made his name known throughout Pennsylvania.
The seat has been held by the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political commentators say the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States has withdrawn its sanctions on neighboring El Salvador after considering
The diplomat noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had recognized China, with little opposition from the United States.
Trump held a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Barrera of Panama in June 2017, and they both stayed at a hotel in Panama until the Trump administration's operations team withdrew.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to "the recent decision to suspend Taiwan's recognition", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug-addiction prevention, development and economic assistance, was considered for the penalties.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, were painful for the Central American country, which is plagued by high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal discussions progressed, North and Central American officials postponed high-level talks focused on security and economic development. This followed a similar meeting last year that was seen as a breakthrough in efforts to prevent immigration flows to the United States.
However, by mid-September, government officials had made clear they wanted to move forward with the meeting, effectively ending the review of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to address Congress in mid-October on imports that the government aims to discuss at the meeting, diplomats said.
Without any new harsh messages or sanctions from the United States, three special envoys secretly returned from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the discussions between the three U.S. officials. Two of these diplomats agreed to speak on condition of anonymity about what they had discussed internally.
These explanations were confirmed by outside analysts from government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
His background in research.
The next piece of evidence could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice.
According to reports, Mueller is investigating whether Trump's campaign was colluding with Russia to target the US election.
If Congress changes its mind, Trump will be held accountable to the majority party and even to a jury of lawmakers as he prepares for his re-election campaign.
That doesn't necessarily mean that Mr. Trump or the European leaders will be removed from office, although there are many assumptions.
The choices that will depend on how long the difficulties last must be made on both sides of the Atlantic.
If the West resisted Hitler and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich, German officials were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler in 1938.
But it failed, and it missed the opportunity to avoid the genocide that followed for years.
History can turn such turning points into boundaries, and the rigorous progress of democracy can be accelerated or hindered.
Americans are facing several turning points like this.
What would happen if Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who had a hand in Mueller's investigation?
Mr. Rosenstein had been in trouble since the publication of his report that suggested he had secretly recorded the president last year and speculated that the president was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times article was inaccurate.
"How would you respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Mr. Brett Kavanaugh was not complete or fair, or if the Supreme Court upheld him despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?"
More than that, will we vote for a midterm congressional election that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If these tests fail, democracy will enter a long winter.
But I think I learned a lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovak origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied my ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with a wooshtka.
And given my traditions, why can't I be optimistic about the future?

Graham Drans of the Rangers, Rapid, confident in the battle of Vienna.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday. A brilliant draw in Spain earlier this month against Austria will increase their chances of breaking through Group G of the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Drans was out of action this season with a knee injury until the 2-2 draw at Bijarreal, but he believes the Rangers can make a leap forward from that result.
"Visual Array is a good team, so it's good to get points", the 31-year-old said.
"We believed we could get at least one point when we got into the game.
Perhaps it was well argued at the end, but overall the draw would be a fair result.
I think we had a good first half, but we showed our strength in the second half and went into the game with the advantage.
Thursday night is the big game in the European league.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because the other team had a good result in the previous game. But I believe that with the support of the fans, we can work hard and give good results.
Last year was definitely a tough year, because of my injuries and the changes in the club, but I feel comfortable now.
The team is good, the teammates are having a lot of fun, and the training is great.
From now on, I'll forget about last season and try to be successful.
And I think that's why we're doing this.
Despite the fact that the surveyed have a clear idea of what kind of care they want, few people talk about it with their families.
In a national survey, nearly half said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent of them talked to their kids about it.
"People want to take care of their families, but they don't actually have the conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of a national life insurance company.
I'll show you how to start a conversation.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not let them know your wishes in advance, your family will not be able to prepare for care.
Work with counselors and family members to discuss where and how to get care. These choices are important in determining costs.
Use a financial advisor. Advisors can also help you when you are considering how to pay for such expenses.
Long-term care financing options may include traditional long-term care insurance, which covers expenses, or hybrid cash value life insurance, which insures the home with self-funding if funds are available.
They prepare legal documents; they prevent legal disputes from occurring.
You will have a healthcare representative to supervise your care and appoint a trusted individual to ensure that the specialist will follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
We'll also consider a finance commission.
If you can't do that, choose someone you trust to make financial decisions and make sure you pay your bills instead.

The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have been killed and more are expected to die in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Par on Friday, officials said.
Communications were disrupted and rescue officials were unable to obtain information from Dongara district in northern Pal, near the magnitude 7.5 quake's epicenter.
In Par, 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
The following are the main facts about Par and Dongala on Sulawesi Island.
Pal is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. Its population in 2017 was estimated at 379,800.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongala is a prefecture located along the northwestern coastline of Sulawesi Island.
The prefecture is a smaller administrative district than the state, with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the state, but is mostly concentrated in the coastal Morowali on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Par and Dongala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami, and hundreds of houses were destroyed in Donggala.
Donggala was also hit by a tsunami in 1996 that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred recently:
On 26 December 2004, a massive earthquake struck the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh province.
In late March and early April 2005, a strong earthquake struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck in the south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near the provincial capital Padan, West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits an island off the coast of Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake in the Pidi Jayia district of Aceh caused devastating damage and people became panicked, recalling the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not occur, but the collapse of the building killed more than 100 people.
2018: A major earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded many tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son is in custody on suspicion of domestic violence.
The eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Truck Palin, was arrested on suspicion of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police, Vasilla Palin, 29, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence reports and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when the woman's acquaintance tried to report the suspected crime to the police, he picked up the woman's phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is being held in a Machu Pre-Trial Facility on $500 bail.
According to the network, he appeared in court on Saturday and claimed "of course he is innocent" in response to confirmation of his confession.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal case has been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the allegations of assault to police.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence reporting and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
He claimed his girlfriend was beaten in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 for linking her son's violence to PSTDs caused by his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesia earthquake tsunami
An earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday, killing 384 people.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks will be shut down and the death toll is expected to rise in the future.
The quake struck in central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
A video capturing the shocking moment has been circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people were gathering at the beach festival in Perth when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal police are seeking the rare death penalty for a New York City terrorist suspect.
The New York Federal Police are seeking the death penalty for Cyphro Cyphov, a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people. This is a very rare death penalty for a federal crime that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Sayopov, 30, used a truck he rented from a home depot to attack a bicycle lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists indiscriminately.
In order to justify the death penalty, according to a death penalty intent notice filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious injury.
According to court documents, both charges are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the raid, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, assault and car destruction, for the threatening tactic commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases.
The prosecutor said the raid required "adequate planning and foresight" and called Saipov's actions "vicious, cruel and despicable".
"Cyfro Habibliayevic, Cypov, Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anrol Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Elridge, Arnan Feruci, Arnan Diego Mendoza, Alejandro Damián Panguenco, and their families and friends were injured and lost", the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time a death sentence was applied for in the Southern District of New York was 10 years ago.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a federal case in New York was two years earlier in 1953, when Julia Rosenberg and Essel Rosenberg were convicted of spying for the Soviets during the Cold War.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenbergs were executed.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse for the attack even days and months later.
He said he had no regrets about going to the police, the police announced.
In the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he had watched ISIS videos on his cell phone and had the idea for the attack.
Police also announced that they had asked for ISIS flags to be raised in the hospital.
He also pleads not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal election lawyers defending Saipov, said he was "clearly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We do not accept a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole, but we believe that seeking the death penalty will only prolong the trauma of such an event for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say negotiations to leave the EU are in place for Nigel Farage.
Nigel Farage announced today that he would "mobilize the People's Army" during a protest against the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party needed to feel the "pressure" of eurosceptics after one of Theresa May's MPs said he was qualified to negotiate with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bourne said that if Farage had been the UK's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, Britain would have "already left".
However, the problem May faced in reconciling with divided MPs was that Conservative leftists had joined city protests against leaving the EU.
The Prime Minister has found it difficult to maintain her plan amid criticism from the EU's Leave, Remain and compromise checkers.
May's supporters argued that May was trying to get a deal with the EU amid the backlash and was faced with a choice between her compromise proposal or "chaos" against euro-skeptics and Labour.
Bourne told the Solihull "Leave is Leave" rally, "The Checkers want to give up".
He said that he should consider Mr. Farage a pro-EU negotiator.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out of here already".
The member of Parliament for Wellingborough said: "I support leaving the EU, but the Chequers should stop".
He said, "We can't fight a world war and be subservient.
We want our own laws in this country.
Bourne has rejected the idea that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people want to reconsider and stay is completely untrue".
Andrea Jenkins, a Conservative EU Leave candidate, also attended the rally and told reporters: "I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Checkers are unpopular with the general public, unpopular with the opposition, unpopular with the party and even with the activists who actually walked the streets to win the election.
I want the checkers to take it down and listen to their opinions".
In a message addressed to May, he said: "The Prime Minister can remain in office as long as he keeps his promise".
Farage said politicians attending the rally would "feel pressure" if something were to betray the 2016 referendum's decision.
"This is a matter of trust between us, the people, the political class", he said.
"They are trying to betray us by leaving the EU, and we are now telling them we cannot accept that".
He told an enthusiastic audience: "I want you to feel the pressure on the political class who are betraying the EU.
"We will not rest until we have mobilized the people's army of this country that led to victory in the Brexit vote and become a proud Britain that has achieved independence and autonomy".
Meanwhile, the remnants marched on Birmingham and held a two-hour final rally in the city centre.
After the group's launch this week, disunited activists raised the banner of the Conservative Party against leaving the EU.
Baron Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the Conservatives at the start of the convention over the security issues that were the party's app.
They were the ones who said they could introduce IT systems and all kinds of technology to make it possible for Canada to have a smooth border crossing and free trade without borders in Ireland".
"This is a complete hoax.
There is no such thing as a favourable exit from the EU".
Warren is "preparing himself for the presidency".
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was "carefully preparing for the presidential election" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about the following Saturday during a debate in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Republican Jeff Deal, who was vice chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is gaining attention for challenging Trump in 2020.
The event, held in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, was Trump's 36th meeting with voters since becoming president.
One participant asked if she would run for president.
Warren said it was time for "women to run for the White House and fix a broken government", and that "that includes a woman president".
Arrested for the Louisiana State University Simms shooting.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wade Sims, a Louisiana State University basketball player, on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of DeTeon Simpson, 20, on the 11 a.m. news.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday and were seeking information that could lead to the identity of the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday morning on the campus of Southern University.
According to 247Sports, "Wade Sims died from a gunshot wound to the head", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wade was shot by Simpson as he broke in to protect his friend.
Simpson admitted to the hearing that he was at the scene, that he had a weapon, and that he shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-3 college freshman from Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: team, order, Louis Hamilton wins against Sebastian Bethel and is close to winning the title.
The moment Bartelli Bottas passed qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team, the Order, played a big part in the race.
Bottas, who had made a good start from his position, was on the verge of defending his lead in the first two rounds, and making it impossible for Bettel to play Hamilton in a ranking match.
Bethel pitted first, and Hamilton was able to catch up with the lap-delayed team, but this usually determines the race.
Hamilton, driving a Mercedes, pitched after one lap and moved behind Bethel, but in the third corner, he took the lead after a Ferrari-powered Bethel, who had prevented two overtakes, was unable to prevent him from taking the lead.
Max Berstäppen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh in the first round.
He then reduced his time and kept the lead for most of the race without changing tyres to overtake fourth-place Lycogen.
In the end, he pitched in the 44th round, but could not improve his pace in the remaining eight laps, and Lyconen was fourth.
It was a tough day because Bartelli was so nice all weekend and so gentle to let me go first.
The team did a great job with a first and second finish", Hamilton said.
I'm so sorry about your body, your language.
President Donald Trump mocked the claims of Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday that she had not leaked a letter from Christine Brissey Ford, who is accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president commented that while he did not directly address Mr. Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the events in the Senate showed that people were "vile, malicious, and liars".
"One of the great things that could happen in the Senate, and one of the great things that's happened in the last few days, is when I witnessed anger, when I witnessed angry people, mean, mean, lying people", he said.
"I see the releases and leaks and I'm like, 'I didn't do it.
I'm not doing it".
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer, leak the documents?
No, I'm not going to.
I didn't leak it".
Wait a second.
"We leaked, no, we didn't leak", he added, to the impression of the senator.
Mr. Feinstein received a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Mr. Kavanaugh, which was leaked in early September, but Mr. Feinstein denied that the leaks were from his office.
The Hill reported that Feinstein told the committee that he had neither concealed Dr. Ford's claims nor leaked the story.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret".
But her denial seemed to be out of step with the president's comments at a Saturday night rally: "I think it was too bad body language.
She probably didn't think it was the worst body language I'd ever seen".
He further defended the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct against three women, saying the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take whatever measures are necessary.
"The people of the United States will see that they are despicable, mean, and will not hurt anyone, or kick anyone to gain power and control", Mediaite reported the president's comments.

A massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, killing more than 800 people and leaving many missing.
Strong aftershocks continue to occur in the area, with many people trapped in the city of Par.
While his colleagues were escaping, 21-year-old Antonio Gunawan managed to escape from the shaking control tower at Mutilaar Siss Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed until he saw the safe takeoff of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time of the earthquake.
Then I jumped out, thinking the control tower was collapsing.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Seurat said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
He was taken by helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived.
"We are heartbroken by this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities said the death toll could reach 1,000 and the National Disaster Management Agency said access to Donggala, Sighi and Buton was restricted.
"The number of casualties is likely to rise further as many people are still trapped under the rubble and cannot be rescued", said Stoppo Nugroho, a spokesman for the authorities.

This is already a tragic situation and it could get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Par on Sunday and told the military: "I want you to work day and night and complete all the tasks necessary for evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia: More than 550 people have died in an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year.
Air New Guinea says the plane crashed into a coral reef and one person is missing.
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific reef off Micronesia said that all 47 passengers and crew were initially evacuated safely from the sinking plane, but that one man was missing.
Air New Guinea announced that one male passenger was missing as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for passenger details such as age and nationality.
The other passengers and crew of the plane that crashed into the sea while attempting to land at Cheuk Island Airport were rescued by a local boat.
Authorities said seven people were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the sequence of events remain unknown.
Both the airline and the US Navy announced that the plane had crashed into a coral reef just off the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone too far down the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane crashed in low-level airspace.
"It was very good", said Mr. Jaynes.
Mr. Jaynes said he and others walked through waist-deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and he suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors working on the hull repairs were also using inflatable boats to return people to shore and assist in rescuing them before the plane sank about 100 feet.
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have died in crashes involving PNG-based airlines over the past 20 years, but Air New Guinea was not involved.
An analyst explains the timeline of the night the woman was burned alive.
In the retrial of a man accused of burning a living Mississippi woman in 2014, prosecutors made their final defense on Saturday.
Paul Rowlett, a US Justice Department analyst, testified for several hours as a reference in the field of information analysis.
He used cell phone records to match the movements of 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers to the 29-year-old defendant Kinton Teres, who was dead the day of Chambers' death.
Mr. Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones showing that Teres was with him the night Chambers died. This contradicted Teres' previous testimony, the Clarion Ledger reported.
The police went to Sanford to question him because cell phone data showed he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford.
Sanford testified on the stand on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if it was true that Teressa said she was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford testified, "He's lying because his truck was in Nashville".
It was also contradictory that Teres had been seeing him for about two weeks when Chambers died.
According to his cell phone records, he only met her a week ago.
Mr. Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Teres deleted his text, phone and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Mr. Hale said.
The defendant will begin his final statement on Sunday.
The judge said that the trial would proceed to a jury verdict later that day.
The High Breed: What is rational hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio is trying to challenge the negative image of the genre by putting a positive message into their music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its original political message and approach to social issues.
They want to get back to their roots, get back to hip-hop again.
Artists like Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists like Accra and Rocky.
Black again?
A New York babysitter sues a couple who fired her after a "racist" text.
A New York babysitter sues a couple for being discriminated against by being fired after receiving a text message from her mother that said, "The black man is here again".
The couple called the lawsuit "coercive" and denied being racist.
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed confusion when she learned that her new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day on the job in 2016.
"No one is black again", Placebo-Flexman texted her husband.
But the text was not from her husband, but from Morris twice.
According to the New York Post, "concerned" by the disorder, Placebo-Flexman fired Morris, saying that the African-American babysitters he had previously fired were expecting Filipino workers instead because of the poor quality of their work.
Morris was paid for the day and sent home by Uber.
This time, Morris sued the couple for the cost of firing them, demanding compensation of $350 a day for six months if they worked in the original planned residence, even though they had no contract.
"I want to tell them, you can't do this", she told the Post on Friday.
The couple denied the accusation of being racist and argued that the firing was justified because they feared they could not trust Morris after she had made them feel uncomfortable.
"My wife texted her something, but it didn't mean anything.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But even if it was a mistake, would you trust your child to someone you've been rude to?
Your newborn baby?
I can't do that".
To make the lawsuit "compulsory", Plasco said that his wife had only been with the baby for two weeks and that it was "a very difficult situation".
"Is this how you treat people in such a difficult situation?
"That's not a good thing", the investment banker added.
As the legal case progresses, court opinion spreads rapidly, couples are accused on social media, and their behavior and logic are bashed.
Paddington Publishers, who were concerned that the talking bear would be unacceptable to their readers, received a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine what it's like to read it for the first time before it's published.
And so, what I know about Paddington now is that it's a great success.
She said that her father, who was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a children's book by a small bear toy, would have been optimistic if he hadn't accepted the job, and that the 60th anniversary of his death last year was "Bittersweet".
Describing Paddington as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a very quiet man, not one to brag", she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was like when his own child accomplished something, he felt proud of it, even if he didn't do anything special.
I think that's how my father felt about Paddington's success.
It was his creation and his imagination, but he always praised Paddington himself".
My daughter was on her deathbed, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where she was treated by doctors with little hope.
"Nad called several times to say that she was in a very dangerous condition and that she could not be saved", said Ednan Laperouse.
"And then Nad called me and said, 'You have to say goodbye, she's gonna be dead in two minutes.'
And I told him.
I said, "You're so cute. I love you so much".
I'll be right there.
I'll be out in a minute.
The medication the doctors gave her to stop her heart from beating slowly stopped her from moving.
She's already dead and all this has stopped.
I just sat there and waited, knowing everything was going on.
I was surrounded by many family members and people, so I couldn't scream, scream, or cry.
I had to endure it".
In the midst of her deep grief over the loss of her daughter, Ednan Laperuz was eventually forced to board the plane with other passengers and endure the situation.
"No one knew", she said.
"She was bowing her head, tears flowing down her face.
It's hard to explain, but it was this flight that made me feel this unbearable sadness for Nad.
What he needed was my love and understanding.
He really loved her".
Sad women are putting up cards on bridges to prevent suicide.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent attempts to end their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries continue to hang cards on the Wales Bridge with phone numbers where they can receive heartfelt messages and support.
Davis' son Tyler was diagnosed with depression at age 13 and took his own life at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, of Lidney, said her son was a smiling, bright-eyed chef with a promising future.
"Everybody knew his smile.
Everyone said his smile would brighten any room".
But he was in a really dark place, and he quit his job before he died.
In 2014, Tyler's younger brother, who was 11 at the time, discovered his brother's death.
Davis said, "I'm very worried about a chain reaction".
Davis made a card. "Even if you're a friend, I want people to know that you have someone to go and talk to.
Don't be silent - speak".
Humphries, a longtime friend of Davis, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say anything about being depressed or depressed", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was so depressed on Christmas Day -- he didn't even look at the kids when they were opening their presents".
She said his death was a great trauma for the children, but they had to get over it.
And then we just made it a little bit more complicated.
But we all have to fight this".

The FBI investigation has made Brett Kavanaugh's future unpredictable.
"With limited time and scope of investigation, I thought we might be able to get a little closer if we could actually get what he was looking for". On Saturday, Flake said, adding that he was concerned the committee was "splitting" amidst the deep paralysis of partisanship.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not like the FBI investigation?
All their hesitation is a matter of timing.
The midterm elections are coming up in five weeks, November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans are out of control, they will be very weak in choosing the man they want to be on the Supreme Court of the United States.
George W. Bush called the Senators and pressured them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House, and his wife, Ashley, who served as Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI creates that report?
Voting begins in the Senate, which has 51 Republican and 49 Democratic members.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Kavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would be enough for Vice President Mike Pence to break the record and have him confirmed by the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has declined under the Kim regime.
South Korean lawmakers said the number of North Korean exiles in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Citing data from the Ministry of Unification, Park said 1,127 defectors were in the country last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main reasons were tougher border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates of smuggling by smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Many North Korean exiles are gradually granted citizenship in Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the War of Attrition in 1953.
Many of them are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easily overrun compared to the border, which is heavily guarded by the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between South and North Korea.
China often considers asylum seekers illegal immigrants rather than refugees and forcibly returns them.
In fact, the relations between the North and the South, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This was done after the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which largely agreed on moves towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Sunday, North Korean Foreign Minister Yong Ho condemned the US sanctions that have not progressed since then.
"Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not unilaterally move to denuclearization ourselves", Li said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi said that Brett Kavanaugh was "hysterical" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament was unsuitable for Supreme Court engagements.
Pelosi commented in an interview on Sunday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"It is inconceivable that a woman would be described as 'hysterical' if she had acted like this", Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday about her reaction to Cabano's testimony.
Cabano emotionally denied Dr. Christine Brazy Ford's allegations that they had both been sexually assaulted as teenagers.
During his opening statement, Cabano was very emotional, occasionally screaming or blurring his words during discussions with his family and in high school.
He also sharply denounced the committee's Democratic members, calling the allegations against him "an oddly coordinated defamation" orchestrated by liberals angry about Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she was convinced that Cabano's testimony had proven that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his Democratic bias.
"I think he is unfit for these statements and his manners toward Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
When asked if she would impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House, Pelosi expressed difficulty.
"Let's just say -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not only incompetent in the Supreme Court, he's not even in the courts that he's currently serving in", Pelosi said.
Cabano is currently a judge on the D.C. Superior Court.
Pelosi, a Democrat, is considered a conservative judge, and she is concerned about Cabano's potential dominance over the health care reform law and Roe v. Wade.
At his confirmation hearing, Cabano avoided the question of whether he intended to overturn a particular Supreme Court decision.
"It's not the stage where a hysterical, prejudiced person goes to court and says, 'Isn't that great?'"
And women need to be able to do that.
It was a justifiable, fierce reproach, and it was a fury that would last for months and years, and she could not get rid of it except by crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, but what about it?"
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere. She cried when she was angry, but when she was angry and started crying, she developed a technique where she said to her interlocutor, 'You think I'm crying because I'm sad.
I'm angry with you".
And she just keeps crying.
And I thought it was so great".
Tears are not understood in the main, so some of the anger is acknowledged as an insult.
One of the most vivid memories I have of my old job, in a male-dominated office, is that I was crying in a rage that I could not describe, when I was dragged down the stairwell by a collared older woman, a cold manager who I had been a little afraid of from day to day.
"Never show them tears", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy to see you down".
The Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, Patricia Schrader, was campaigning for Gary Hart's presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart resigned from the race after being discovered to have been involved in an affair called Monkey Business, Ms. Schrader was deeply sorry and felt there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", she said, laughing after 30 years.
"There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing we needed was one more candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because she was too late to start her campaign, and she was underfunded, she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
I learned that some of her supporters offered her $250 despite the fact that she offered $1,000 to men.
"Do they think I got a discount?" she lamented.
When she made a speech announcing that she would not officially launch a campaign, she was filled with a range of emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, fundraising, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to target voters rather than representatives, and anger at the contempt for women.
"You must have thought my nerves were weak", Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the press had contacted her.
"You must have thought Clinex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what words would be written on my tombstone.
"Where's the weeping bug?"
So, what's the benefit of the US-China trade war to Beijing?
While the trade war between the United States and China has begun with a single attack and is still far from over, experts say the rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump warned earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest tariff move this week will affect the equivalent of 200 billion pounds ($150 billion) of goods, effectively taxing half of the goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in the same way every time, most recently imposing a 5 to 10 percent tariff on $60 billion of American goods.
China has vowed to fight back against the United States every time, and the world's second largest economy is not likely to back down anytime soon.
To bow to Washington means surrender, but to obey the United States openly is a great humiliation for China's supreme leader Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing handles its cards right, the pressure of the U.S. trade war could be beneficial to China in the long run by curbing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision by Washington or Beijing could create a situation where economic chaos begins in either country is more dangerous than observers previously thought", said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the New American Security Center, a think tank focused on Asia.
The Syrian Foreign Minister is ready to return the refugees.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by seven years of war.
According to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is continuing to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the circumstances are now in place for refugees who have been forced to evacuate due to terrorism, economic measures that are biased against their daily lives and livelihoods, and who are willingly returning to their country.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have been displaced since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people are still living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime welcomes support for the reconstruction of the collapsed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional support or support from countries that sponsor civil unrest.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
At Le Golf National, outside Paris, France, he held off the United States team and the European Union team won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The United States currently has six consecutive losses in European competition, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe, the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States and regain the crown.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had been stuck in the tournament for most of the tournament, drops a tee shot on the 16th hole of par 3 into the pool and admits his match to Francisco Morinari.
Italian golfer, Morinari, has excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of four players to reach 5-0-0 in the current format of the tournament, which began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States lost 5-4 to Denmark's Thorbjørn Olsen, the lowest ranked player on the European team.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who would have played in the Ryder Cup final.
The eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Sergio Garcia of Spain, is the tournament's all-time European winner with 25.5 career points.
"I don't normally cry, but I can't help it today.
It was a very difficult year.
So I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very happy. I'm really happy to get the cup back.
This is a team, and I'm very happy to contribute".
He handed the baton to his compatriot, John Rum, who beat American golfing legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in Sunday's singles.
"It's an incredible feeling of pride to win against Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and finished with a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
The odd statistic for an unprecedented player to win 14 major titles is Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played well during the tournament, the United States team struggled to find a fairway over the weekend.
U.S. captain Jim Frook said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the team. They fought.
We discussed Europe this morning.
We had a fight.
Let's give a shout out to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We're going to put our team back together and work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee to move forward.
I love these 12 men very much and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You must put your hat away.
We've been defeated".
Red tide updates: decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that red tide concentrations are declining on average in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, patcher color conditions have been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Coliere groups, indicating a decrease in concentration.
The red tide occurs roughly 130 miles from northern Pinellas County to the southern coast of Lee County.
The patches can be found about 10 miles offshore in Hillsborough County, but are seen in fewer places than last week.
Red tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, moderate concentrations were reported in or near Pinellas County, low to high concentrations in or near Hillsboro County, high concentrations from element detection in Manatee County, high concentrations from element detection in or near Sarasota County, moderate concentrations from element detection in Charlotte County, high concentrations from element detection in or near Lee County, and low concentrations in Coria County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Coria counties, respiratory inflammation is still being reported.
No respiratory infections have been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
