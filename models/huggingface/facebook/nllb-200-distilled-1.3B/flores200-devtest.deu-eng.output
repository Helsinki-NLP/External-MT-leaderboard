This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's already widely accepted, but it also provides details that fossils generally can't provide, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brownish-brown on the top and light or carotenoid-colored on the bottom.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but do have other features of feathers - hooks and barbules - researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or heartbeat, and the researchers suspected that the sample, although the tail of a young dinosaur, showed the feathers of an adult and not the downs of a chicken.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult and not cuckoo.
A car bomb detonated yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two policemen and wounding more than twenty others.

They found that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: It was found that the activity of all the stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, their rotation and nothing else.
To determine the Rossby number of a star associated with the plasma flow, the luminosity and rotation are taken into account together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic field re-polarization.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a sheet of paper in an envelope with the name of the candidate of their choice.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law sets the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes are present at the start of the election and that no envelopes are dropped except those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attend each part of the process as witnesses, and in the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: Journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc., of suspects.
The Crown Office, which is the lead law enforcement agency, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the charges are laid.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians demand a return of the borders to the state before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants to accept such a presence for only five years.
The guards of the accompanying pest control experiment should be closely supervised by rangers as the experiment has been monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Through a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association hunting programme.
According to Mick OFlynn, the Executive Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunt were given extensive safety and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Commission yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, some of them violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been held since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating on broken iPods have been reported, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the equipment.
"Last week, METI announced that it had been notified by Apple of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as 'not serious'".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report 'really regrettable'.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Disaster Management Agency said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work at the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the maturation of the fetus' lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two Black Box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Wrestler colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes, my first manager, Luna died on the night of the two moons, very unique, just like her, a strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented: "Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those polled said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three-legged events, but his fitness was questioned because of his many complaints.
He was unable to take the medication he needed to overcome his pain, as it is banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
The discovery was confirmed by numerous people using various hardware and software in early February and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists are hoping to gain insight into how planets, especially the earth, form.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense".
There is speculation that he could run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional means of transport will be provided and no overground trains will stop at Wembley, and no parking or park and ride facilities will be available on site.
Concerns about lack of transportation made it more likely that the game would be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the appearance of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it had previously been thought that this process took much longer because of the mating between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways, and it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to a thin wire that can be spun and braided, hammered, or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures called picture manuscripts in books called picture manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird and forms a kind of protective layer.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every home had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public baths that men and women used in mixed company.
If you're calling someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest service the wheel has done us is to make transportation much easier and faster.
It brought us the railroad, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that every cat has and that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called packs.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act similarly to wolf packs or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats) and equally lethal to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not particularly well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-mouthed roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase of gruntled roared words.
Ocelots eat small animals. If they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists believe that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and locate prey, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move about unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by visually matching their environment and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, when they move over a mountain range or a river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it used to be.
The original population has not changed at all, and it still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans expel (that is, they exhale).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We build our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants. We eat mostly plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water, even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the sleeper.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their meals sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to hold communal banquets where they lay on their side while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman dishes could not contain foods that were brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of the god.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to please the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room that was only for priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called zikkurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, homes were not of much importance.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard, the shops were just open counters, the houses were built with stone.
The land of Canaan lacked extensive forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Old Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. As he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "The Legacy of the Templars", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence was drawn with a treasure map.
Although the document has some writing on the back, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for preservation early in its life.
It is therefore possible that the note was simply added as a marking.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them".
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the American and French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and that also kind of defines the size of a society.
A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary Wars, the 13 states formed a weak central government based on the Federal Treaty, consisting only of the Congress.
Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and with no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Nor did he have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful in the world, along with the German national football team, and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
"Because of the cluster/group of islands that became Japan, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipel".
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a branch in southwestern Taiwan, changing the way the natives grew grain and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is mainly made up of three structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of what they originally looked like.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most widely used still format is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, its image format was adopted from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35 mm format is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore known as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates momentum while maintaining a degree of order in a picture.
It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being tested.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held European nations together despite their different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main tenets of Christian faith is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that is why churches have money.
The centralization of church power in Rome for over a thousand years led many to question whether this principle was being met.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade was in violation of generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating entire stretches of sea, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to prevent another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different eras. Each period in China and each family that was in power was its own dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those days, bitter wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the supreme throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, like the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Even after the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of class rankings, army rankings were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this everyday life, and he often visited a cave known as Hira on the mountain of Nur to meditate.
The cave itself has stood the test of time and provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists.
Nothing is seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world is seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Pyramid of Cheops is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The Scroll symbol looks like a V and the Scroll symbol looks like a bracket or a square with the bottom line missing.
Up means you should start at the top and push the bow. Down means you start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The painting usually generates a softer sound, while the stripping is more powerful and expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings, but remember that the printed arrow markings are there for musical reasons, so they should normally be respected.
The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (the 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789, in Versailles.
They were traveling back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people threatening the King and Queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At one point, a member of the angry crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the eyes of the horrified queen.
The war costs of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds flowed through the Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits that came from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (10001300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human fate is determined by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has effects on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
It can be argued, for example, that the development of roads is inevitable with the advent of the passenger car.
However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawing on writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily enacted laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its glory as an epicenter of luxury began about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fix clothes as a result of the Crusades.
The purpose of the agricultural policy is to ensure that the agricultural sector is able to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, way of growing that uses seed from the local area and combines it with alternate field farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ from one another by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
"Such children are called 'wild' or wild. Some wild children were held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases the child's neglect was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's considerable intellectual or physical limitations".
Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, the feral child shows behaviors (within its physical capabilities) that are almost completely in line with those of its specific pet, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather an aid to support individuals in a novel learning situation, such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little office clipper in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants are built into the software and are designed to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student may not be able to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and educational, but many are forced to.
For us, the foster care system is a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The care centre should provide all the needs that they did not have in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in the benefit and reward approach.
For example, learning and socialization are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and lasting relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.x
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who cannot understand language because of brain damage can still correctly judge people's honesty.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Out in the savannah, it's hard for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
It also has serious consequences if neglected: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
Overall, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking during normal sleep periods and falling asleep a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you're someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so you're forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known to be diuretic) before bedtime, forcing you to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the level of tension in body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive the life force, and everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, and it's made up of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the awakening of Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the God Yoga, where the visualization of different gods clears the energy channels, opens the chakras, and brings about enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to a cooperation between the USSR and the United States. After the war ended, the collision of systems, course and culture led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the war ended, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and in reality would be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses had completely collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and reposition along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered almost obsolete overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers invaded and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's role has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains capable of transporting people and goods, while also impeding the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, when the Americans tried to bring personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany probably could have conquered Britain just as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated as early as 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as farm animals to get their milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed on hills or other pastures, tended by goat herders, much like the better-known sheep herders, often children or adolescents, and still used today.
In England, conveyor rails were built as early as the 16th century.
Although the conveyor rails were merely parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced early on to secure the position of the rails, but gradually the realization spread that rails that carried a band of iron were more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones.
The first known form of movement was walking, and humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means "straight man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not stand up as regularly.
Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little bit.
This is often just a symptomatic treatment, but if you don't want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it.
It is really obvious that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances and that the problems have become more serious because of overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of people.
After its passage by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pages that remain are the oldest extant copies of the document, and the original manuscript has not survived the test of time.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best sign of poisoning by swallowing may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term Wanze is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are highly adaptable to parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and predators are nidicols, that is, adapted to live in the nest or the dwelling of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or that of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take over.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works by using the scientific method. This method is, in fact, the basis of most scientific research.
However, it is not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the loss of Greek language knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often based in large part on the presence of bodily cycles and their production by biological clocks.x
Cyclic behaviours, which are not just reactions to signs of external cycles, are known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that keep on oscillating for a while even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the most authoritative pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they either tagged the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation involved, the importance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the cells involved are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to go to work and are passed by others whose workplace is in the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuter transport, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on the private car.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems fail like this, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because one cannot predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a fairly consistent manner, so traffic flows are relatively constant and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and sexual partners more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider variety of small hiding places to hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and dayflies are the only insects that can't fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system's motions.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed otherwise - that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, because it doesn't seem like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and most water-rich river on earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, sometimes up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows through the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers long, and it draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical perfection.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times because they are all found in their original form in nature and can be mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
The universe as a whole is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has been pushed into the background, with its status and use being relegated.
Nowadays, people are texting on computer screens without ever having to get close to a headset.
You can be curious to see what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like when you roll a heavy truck up a hill, when the core splits again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they decay with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more Maria on the near side, because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during their adulthood.
These theories deal with what makes certain people want the very things they do and what influences in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues.
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performing performance reviews, assigning responsibilities and taking on staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did, and take everything for himself.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be considered by local management.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? One goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organisation to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative approach to responding to customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition, and so it narrows the scope of research and makes it a little bit more specific.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, like trauma, injury and tumors, affect behavior and lead to changes in some brain functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand what's going on in our heads.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, strategy and timetable setting, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in business, medicine, engineering and the military, and has also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school classroom, and often a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not possible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution, allowing students to view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital every year, and the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collector's album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, that usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blogger tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to learn more about the world around them.The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can enable pupils to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, pupils can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and present their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is distinguished by a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north the pristine beauty of nature extends into Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario what outsiders may consider to be typical of Canada.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many is that there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and wildlife-rich continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider assault, and that it is not uncommon to be stalked, to be held by the arm, etc.
Be consistent when rejecting men and don't be afraid to defend your point of view (cultural differences, that's not good!)
The present-day city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida, and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinnefs are sold, but all this is for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any trip outside Goma should be carefully planned to know the status of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short ride.x
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made Timbuktu a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Although Timbuktu is a popular tourist attraction and has an airport, it is now a poor city.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stations of Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has an Arab rather than African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and entrance fees.
It may also be worthwhile to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is a focal point for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a dazzling bar chart, made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.x
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the opposite bank of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urbanisation is densely packed on newly acquired land along its north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and if you're looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove belt, stretching for 50 miles from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian state is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also contain some of the last remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which one third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal king lions and some 30,000 spotted deer now live there.
Buses run throughout the day from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leaving between 06:30 and 07:30.
Buses between districts are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.x
Public taxis provide a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two lanes of 3.5 metres wide.
The bridge has a clearance height of 15 metres and was completed in August 2011, but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.x
Paraguay, formerly known as the Grand Province of the West Indies, was founded in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at Las Cañitas' polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed at other times of the year.x
Information on competitions and points of sale for polo tickets can be found at the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is fixed in line with the value of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is in Stanley, across from the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted on the remote islands, but British and US currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.x
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there, winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures are usually above +30 °C in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, visitors are to stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
No matter how peaceful bison, wapitis, elk, bears, and virtually all large animals may seem, they can still attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they don't keep enough distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so leave them plenty of room.
Also, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food and keep a clean storage area.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on Upolu Island, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, killing nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
During the Mau-organized independence struggle, a peaceful assembly in the town led to the killing of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland is spread over two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities and most offer shade provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes overcrowded, with a nice shopping promenade along the coast.
The most important local beer is Number One. It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps more tolerable.
You can drink the local tap water without any concerns, but if you're worried, you can also easily find bottled water.
"For Australians, the idea of 'Flat White' coffee is foreign. A small black is 'Espresso', cappuccino is high in cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, observe all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agency.x
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also withhold your reservation for yourself if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or inquiries should first be addressed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festivalgoers choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that in some parts of the festival, music will still be played late into the night, even after the music has stopped on the main stages.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, as breaking ice causes quite a terrible noise for those most affected.
The cruise to St. Petersburg also provides time for a stay in the city.
Casinos generally make a great effort to keep guests in the house as long as possible and to make them spend a lot of money.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests entertained and to keep them staying.
Some gambling establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers realize the importance of staying sober.
If you want to travel at high latitudes or over mountain passes, expect snow, ice, and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the liability is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In a snowstorm, in a very short time, so much snow can fall that you can get stuck.
The visibility may also be affected by falling or passing snow or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.x
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues to flow most of the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to describe a land trip to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are often shy, and you can better observe them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalk, hiking safari, or footing) consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in a tough spot.
The cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus did not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, an average ticket of about ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help with drying. Many hotels lend ironing irons and ironing boards even when you are not in the room.
If ironing is not available or if you do not want to wear ironing socks, you can try using a mop if one is available.
Make sure that the fabric does not become too hot (which can shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various methods of water purification, some of which have proved more effective in countering certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they do not know from their home regions.
Insects can destroy food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, even trigger allergic reactions, deliver poison, or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers whose destination country has high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is perhaps the most challenging for drivers, often traversing remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves predominate here.
The speed limits given are markedly lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, the mobile coverage here is much better than many other areas of the track, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite tasty, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as in the case of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples baked into pastries year-round and cherries and plums used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, try what are called Berliners, pancakes or crepes, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
Inland northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further attributes, the term usually refers to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spicy dishes, with the preference for flavoring being peanuts, chilis, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a range of aromatic spices.
Slingshots are aids to the feet of the rider, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and gets his foot caught on the saddle, he can be dragged along as the horse passes.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety harnesses that allow a harness belt to fall off the saddle when pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley  Chile's main climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite National Park, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes along the walls that offer endless possibilities.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular downhill sports, in which a ski or snowboard is attached to one's feet and driven down a slope over snow-covered ground.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as Skipenner, planning their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport date back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skiing with a backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski hiking.
It is similar to alpine ski touring or mountain climbing, but does not necessarily include these, as the latter are performed in steep terrain and require much tighter skis and boots.
Consider the Skiroute as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than you can when hiking  very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-maintained trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for several visas and go through several passport controls if you wanted to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area, however, functions a little like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen Member States individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what is considered an antique, and some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be called antique, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
In the past, not all Sámi people raised reindeer on a large scale, but lived off fishing, hunting, and the like.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern trades, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region of Sápmi.

Anyone planning to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should receive professional training.
"An Internet search for "Hostile Environments Course" will probably show the address of a local company".
A course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning a gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they carry valid identity documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unstated gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents also varies widely.
The searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the period after 11 September 2001.
Transgender people before their surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to be intact as they pass through the scans.
Rip currents are the return current of waves that break on the beach, often at reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a rapid flow to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur from exhaustion in trying to swim backward against the current, which may prove impossible.
When you're out of the flow, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get to a place where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, maybe wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is less pronounced), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture may find it especially difficult to adjust to their culture of origin.
When you return home from a foreign trip, you have adapted to a different culture and have abandoned some of the ways of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers had to adapt to a new country.
Patience and understanding with returning travelers may not be expected.

The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the different pyramids illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula bounded by Lake Bellingshausen.
The mountains of the peninsula cross here into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountain Range, which is split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally no substitute for a mobile phone, since you have to be outside and in clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure craft, and expeditions requiring data and voice long distance connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on how to connect to this service.
A growing popularity for people planning to take a year off is study and course offerings abroad.
This is especially popular with high school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their studies.
In many cases, participating in a bridging year abroad programme can actually improve your chances of getting a higher education in your home country.
The student must be able to work in a company or enter a business.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands  in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagoes.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to get to the archipelago and the lakes.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, with one in six or eight people owning a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one in forty).
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days, while returning in the evening and staying on the ship.
If you only land during your Bordeaux excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise lines list Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is no shame in that: It is nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning about the workings of airplanes and flight procedures can help some to overcome the fear of the unknown or the feeling of being out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for quick delivery of things, and time is often a very important factor in company documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and smaller companies have had difficulties.
When they sent things by air freight, unloading and customs clearance on some routes could take several days.
The only way to get through faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put a big buck in for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to cover the cost).
But it is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times the first class fare!
In general, it is pointless to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of pilots who are willing to pay a lot of money and demand a price for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Please treat this place with the dignity, reverence and respect it deserves, and don't make fun of the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not desecrate the site by putting or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is legally defined as the first official language.

The rough appearance of the Parisians disappears very quickly if you show basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, with mainly beech, fir and fir trees and a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.

Similarly, men must wear trousers that reach over the knees.
These can also be borrowed at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed for each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts.

Since light pollution was not the problem it is today during its heyday, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses that are easier to reach than those built in recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, with the parish celebrations often beginning at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands either swam, flew or swam here.
Because of its great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main land animal on the Galapagos Islands.
