Butler once again praises the young warrior, Tyler Hero, who takes over the future of Heath, “Thinking is not that of Luke” (Basket Count) - Yahoo! News
Photo: Getty Images Heat's first match was against Kings.
This match, which was won by 104-98, Duncan Robinson scored 18 points of Team High, 15 points followed by Tyler Hero and backcoat performance.
Robinson, the leading shooter in the league, and of course, the 13th nominated Luke, the hero’s step-up will be an important factor for the hit.
The hero missed 15 matches from February to March due to an injury to his ankle, and the last time the season entered a long interruption from the March 12th to the March 12th, when he returned.
The hero says, “I was able to get 100% back in condition because of the time it took, and it’s the best feeling I’ve ever felt,” but the performance at the screaming was more convincing than the words.
Due to the delay of the reunion of Kendrick Nunn, the advanced point guard, the hero's playtime increased and the form that took advantage of the opportunity.
15 points on a different role than usual, so it is worthwhile.
Team leader Jimmy Butler praised the “Favourite” hero this time.
“He can handle, score, and defend, he’s a player who can do anything for the team, because he doesn’t think about any position, he’s thinking about it, he’s looking at the video and he’s thinking about where and how his teammates can move freely and what he should do about it.”
From the beginning of the season, Butler liked the hero Lucky’s unbeatable force and stochastic attitude towards basketball.
That’s why I started training at 4 a.m. and started training together.
Butler once said, “He says his opinion to anyone, and he doesn’t retreat.
Butler is the type of person who always thinks what he thinks, and who knows that a clash will happen when he thinks that it will be for the team.
Thanks to this, relationships with teammates have worsened in the past.
Butler is a hero of his youth.
Butler’s character, which is sometimes too rough for teammates, is a good guide for those who have enough gats to come up with it.
If the relationship between two respectful teachers affects the entire team, the Heat will be a team that can go even higher.

Matsumoto said, “From now on, the level of the opponent will also rise, and I will go back to the runners.”
Sato, who became a joint voter, did not even step two cubs in a favourite bid to hold six times to one assault, leaving him to look at his intention for three years.

16 musicians from Fukushima Prefecture gathered in the singing world with local people (Fukushima News) - Yahoo! News
I want to convey the sound of the beach and the city to the whole world.
Sixteen musicians from Fukushima Prefecture gathered together to make a message song.
Walking towards recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima nuclear accident in Tokyo Electric Power, the Fukushima Prefecture’s stunning appearance fighting the new coronavirus is engraved in the lyrics.
Involving the singing of the inhabitants of the countryside, we will finish the "complete version" by the summer of next year, which will be the ten-year anniversary of the earthquake.
On the 24th, the song was published on the YouTube video post site.
It’s called “Pray from Fukushima.”
We put people’s positive attitudes on a bright and healthy melody of “I want to tell you from Fukushima.”
Under the influence of the new corona, the live house, a base of music activity, was pushed into shutdown, and many musicians lost their place to perform songs and plays.
It is because of the unlikely time to believe in the power of music that the singer-songwriter Nappo (Napo) (46), who lives in South Korea, and Dazu-O (Dazo) (37) of the music group “Mehikari Boys” of the city of Kyushu, planned it.
Napo composes and composes, while Dazo is in charge of rap.
When the project began in March of the coronavirus, singers from Fukushima City, singer-songwriter MANAMI (Manami) (28), and菅野潤 (38), agreed with each other, and instantly the circle spread.
Napo said: “It was an unthinkable luxurious appearance at normal times and I would like to enjoy this opportunity.”
There were no opportunities for sixteen people to gather as a response to the infection, each recorded in a live house or at home.
In an attempt to promote the project, the so-called city painter Miss painted an image character.
It covers Fukushima Prefecture and represents a blue and green nature-rich landscape.
The finished song will be broadcast to the world on YouTube and will also aim to be a CD.
Next year, ten years after the earthquake, the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics are also scheduled to be held.
Dazo said: “We have overcome the difficulties and we are very happy to be encouraged by releasing our songs at the show.”
The other musicians are as follows.

Social media, such as Twitter, has become a key medium to communicate information immediately after disasters or accidents occur.
However, it is difficult for people to always keep an eye on overwhelming information and extract useful information from it.
Specty has the ability to detect things related to natural disasters and accidents from information flowing from social media such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, analyze the content, and deliver to companies using it to determine the truthfulness of the information.
“Positioning events with negative impacts such as stopping or stagnating social activities as a “crisis” in a wide range” (CEO of the Executive Board of村上建治郎), a crisis management support service that visualizes the various crises that occur at home and abroad.
NHK during the earthquake that occurred in April 2016 was the first major use case of Specty, and then the adoption movement spread rapidly among companies.
More than 350 domestic media outlets, including TV stations and newspapers, as well as companies supporting social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, and local governments across the country, are currently using Specty.
Analyze the post and determine the type of “crisis” and where it occurs
Specty delivers information in four steps: “information collection”, “analysis and content classification”, “titling” and “true judgment”.
The company uses information to specify in advance the area where the information is collected (by prefectures and townships, etc.) and the category of crisis (disasters and accidents, etc.).
Specty collects posts covered by that designation using the API provided by the social media.
Next, analyze and classify the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if you see a fire car, black smoke rising from the building and orange flames coming out of the room, you can classify it as “fire”.
In addition, images of crossed cars are classified as "traffic accidents", and images of roads covered with water are classified as "roads".
Spectra also makes estimates of where disasters and accidents occur.
“Sometimes I don’t know where I’m from the posts, so I’m assuming that I’m combining a variety of information,” says the CEO of the village.
For example, if road signs and signs are displayed in images and videos, they extract information about the geographical name from it and identify the location in line with the geographical database.

I heard from the people of Chiba Prefecture "I really thought it wasn't a dialect" - Yahoo! news
People from Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo.
I have lived in the same province for 30 years since I was born.
The “broken crowd” meaning “broken” was used in conversations with friends at the university (Tokyo) for a moment.
I could understand the meaning of the flow and language, but I was told by the people of Tokyo, Saitama Prefecture, not to use it.
“Do you really want to cheat the crowd and get into it?”
If you are connected, you can guess somewhat.
Then another one.
This is not pointed out and not noticed, but the expression "my house" meaning "my house" is not used at all while reading books and so on, and it was a dialect if you did not ask from friends, when you became an adult.
“Our...” was it?
I also use it in my local area, but I did not realize that it was not used naturally since I became an adult.
Japanese “Cold Chinese” is not fun for Chinese ...?
“Cold Pastry” Is Not Popular (Modern Business) - Yahoo! News
In China, the Chinese are “Japanese cold fries.”
As stated in the introduction, cooling Chinese is a Japanese-born Chinese cuisine (Japanese Chinese) conceived on the basis of China's "cooling surface" (liambamien/cold mixing).
Therefore, it originally does not exist in China, but due to the diversification of food, it has become visible in Japanese restaurants in the summer.
Recently, Japanese shops have also featured an array of products featuring “Japanese Meat & Meat & Meat & Meat & Meat & Meat China” and “Japanese Meat & Meat & Meat & Meat & Meat China”.
Meanwhile, Chinese cuisine, such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine, is pushed by the effective Chinese cuisine, and the popularity of Japanese Chinese in China is not high at all.
Of course, the taste of Japanese Chinese is also familiar to the Chinese.
Therefore, it is not unpleasant, but it has a tendency to be criticized for lack of impact.
“Cold Chinese” is no exception, and it is still a minority in China.
As a result, the Chinese name for cold fries in China is “Japanese cold fries”.
It is recognized by the Chinese as one of the Japanese cuisine.
The summer season is “Cool”.
In China, the fried meal that feels like summer isn’t cold-skinned.
In Japan, I think there are many people who are unfamiliar, but cool skin is a flat fries made from wheat powder, rice powder, dump, etc. from Shaanxi (Shanxi) province.
It is said to have a 2000 year history.
In the order of the B-class gourmet that is also sold in the store, the price is 10 to 20 yuan (150 to 300 yen) in advance and is very affordable.
It contains the word “cool” but does not use ice, like in Japanese and Chinese.
Ordinary temperatures are basic.
On top of the fries, top your favourite ingredients such as thousands of slices of cucumbers and peanuts, boiled moyaches, and add medicines such as pacchi,唐辛子, ginger, and peanuts.
Finally, mixed with sauce and laurel oil, vinegar, peanut pasta and peanut pasta, etc., and finished with special flavourings.
In the fries that are frequently thrown through the throat, the sour taste is refreshing and thick, the chicken-sweetened fries are often intertwined, and even when there is no appetite, the fries are smoothly ingested.
Also, because it is permeated throughout China, there are various topings and tasting, and the variety is also a characteristic of cool skin and one of the ways to enjoy it.

Benefits of “Cold Water Shower” for Body and Mind - Yahoo! News
Treat muscle pain and inflammation.
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences, which examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (water therapy), found that the effects on physical and mental healing can be expected.
Drinking cold water after exercise can reduce muscle pain and other inflammatory effects.
According to Professor Douglas Cassà, director of the Korey Stringer Institute, which studies sports medicine and teaches at the University of Connecticut, “It is important to exercise and take a cold shower without taking as much time as possible.
Reduces fatigue.
If you exercise at high temperatures, your heart, muscles and skin will need more blood flow than usual.
“When you exercise, your heart rate increases and you get more blood flow to your heart, which requires more energy to shrink your muscles, and more blood flow to your skin to regulate your body temperature,” says Professor Cass.
“Cold water shower can reduce the temperature of the skin, so you can reduce the amount of blood flow sent to the skin. Instead, it sends blood flow to internal organs such as the stomach, so that the moisture and nutrition are easier to consume even after exercise.
Looking forward to the hormone effect.
Drozhevsky also explains that you can expect the “Hormis effect” to occur by bathing cold water.
The hormitis effect is the idea that it is better to have a little of harmful substances and stress than not at all.
“Low oxygen exercise, fasting, and cold water shower are representative examples of hormones that can be expected for health. Cold water shower can stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters and increase physical and physical strength and resilience.”

A statue of the great village of Zoro (1825–69) which is counted as one of the ten masterpieces of the modern era was spotted on the 23rd in the village of Yakuta, where he was born.
There was an inauguration ceremony in the courtyard of the established Pentagon Regional Exchange Center, and local and administrative officials celebrated the completion.
益次郎 was a military scholar, a western scholar and a physician of the end-of-the-new era.
After standing at the teaching hall of the Shogunate’s Western academic research and education institution, the Tohoku Shogunate, he opened his school in Edo, the “鳩居堂”, where he taught land science, military science, and medicine.
After returning to the Nanjing Clan, he also taught military studies at the Yakuta Mirren Museum.
The bronze statue focused on益次郎 as an educator.
He stood next to the Earth Rite, holding a book in his hand, and shaped the way he was giving lectures in Languages.
The statue is about 3 meters high (1,55 meters) and is made from the eyes of a disciple receiving the lectures of益次郎.
The design was made by the wife of益次郎, the descendants of琴ko, and the local designer,高實まりえ, 27 years old.

Corona Accident “Near the Art” Online Art Museum “HASARD” (from Osaka) launched (Daily East North News) - Yahoo! News
There is a museum where anyone can enjoy art free of charge whenever they like.
It ranges from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unnamed artists in the country.
The online museum “HASARD” has captured users with its convenience and novelty since its “openness” in April 2019 and has gained even greater attention as a result of a new lifestyle caused by the coronavirus.
The website was launched by the representative of the city of Ochoa, Hanoi, 26, who said: “I wanted to create a service where everyone could enjoy art easily and in difficult circumstances, I want you to touch the art.”
When you visit Azor, you will be surprised by the abundance of exhibitions and the beauty of the images.
Today, we have opened a total of 14 exhibitions of permanent exhibitions and project exhibitions, attracting viewers not only of colours, but also of ultra-high-resolution works that pass through to the texture of the pen.
No membership registration or entrance fee is required, and not only the viewers, but also the artists who want to open an exhibition do not cost.
Online appearances also attract attention.
One way is to move the painting.
In Clood Monet’s permanent exhibition “It Begins to Move Again”, digital processing is being applied to move clouds, flowers, grasslands and so on.
“I want people who are less interested in art to be able to get in” (野代表) from the idea, I can taste the feeling of being in the painting.
Her relationship with the artists began when she was a primary school student.
At the time, when I visited my family at the newly completed Aachen Prefecture Museum, I was shocked by the tremendous three paintings of Marc Chagall’s “Aleco.”
On the following day, the art lessons turned into a fun time, and even after going to Tokyo on the occasion of university graduation, I started to take my feet to galleries and so on.
At the same time, large project exhibitions not close to the museum were held only in the capital, and many people felt that from various points of view, such as the difficulty of raising children to go out, there were not many opportunities to get in touch with art.
So, in addition to working in an IT-related company, I spent about two months creating a site that can watch art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the initial 10 months, and after the spread of new coronavirus infection, it increased to about 30,000.
If anyone could see art in a free form whenever they wanted.
The goal of Azar was accepted by more people unwittingly due to the Coronavirus.
He emphasized that it will enrich the imagination about the significance of art appreciation.
“When your imagination is rich, you can reach out to those who are in trouble.
I want art to become a better society.”
A simple reason why the era of quality in China is over and the era of quality in Japan is coming (modern business) - Yahoo! news
Pandemics to change values.
There are many predictions and debates about the post-pandemic world.
On the business side, there may be a change in the article of July 8 “The job of ‘management’ is now beginning to disappear in Japan ... ! its cruel reality” and the article of July 4 “In the world after the Crown, the ‘Japanese manufacturing industry’ is likely to revive ... !”
Only the Japanese don’t know the “strength of Japan” – an unexpected reality seen in Asia
Also on the mental side, the articles of June 26 “Total burning gifts for those who have become aware of the end of life in the corona” and June 10 “Today, the corona is full of riots, let’s look at the effects of God’s prayer in times of suffering” seem to be mainstream.
And what seems clear to our eyes as the combination of the two “materials (economic and business)” and “spirit” is the great flow of “from Chinese quality to Japanese quality”.
For example, if a T-shirt or shirt is bad or faulty, it is annoying, but there is no difference in the life of the person who bought it.
On the other hand, the unprecedented quality of Chinese masks and artificial respirators that have recently been discussed ... ... The “Chinese quality” in such products that directly link to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap it is, you can’t buy such products.
Even if they pay a considerable price, they will seek “Japanese quality” products.
Of course, this trend does not happen only in Japan.
It is also evident that Western countries, which have fallen into difficult situations with a lack of masks and medical equipment, have "returned" one after another to the horror of "Chinese quality".
Safer and safer than peace.
Also, goods such as cars are goods that can be fatal (accidental death) if defective.
Even if the countries that start with China and Korea are attacking with the “cheap or bad” sell-off strategy, they can’t hit Japanese manufacturers at the end, and it becomes a situation like the one stated in the June 16 article “Will the world’s automakers win alone and fall to Toyota?” because the “Japanese quality” is strongly demanded in the products called automobiles.
And this pandemic reminded us that many other products also need to be “confident and safe.”
Also, comfort and safety are important not only in terms of “Japanese quality in manufacturing” but also in terms of “Japanese quality in services such as logistics.”
Like toilet paper bullying, even though the production capacity is proper, the intermediate circulation can be stuck and not reach your hand.
Moreover, like the April 17 article “Who is the real perpetrator of lack of masks! don’t forgive the Chinese Communist Party regime’s fireplace thieves,” it made me feel that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of “confidence and security.”
When it comes to success, it is very important for each country to make sure that its priorities are obvious and that it can obtain essential supplies such as masks (medical equipment) and food in its own country.

It was found that the teflon-processed white paint from the frypan increases the cooling effect with heat loss!
A great discovery!
This year was a rainy season with an unusual amount of rainfall, but if it is bright, the hot summer will be fully classified.
It's hot and hot, and even the heat of the day is so bad that it's even worse than the heat of the day... just imagine it, you're going to get rid of it, don't you?
Global warming is a major global problem, and how to survive a hot summer at least a bit comfortably has reduced the wisdom of mankind.
One way is to wear thin white clothes.
You don’t have to wear black clothes to absorb heat in the summer.
And the same principle is applied to the building of the house, and there are increasing cases where white paint is used.
White is white, but can not be painted with properties that reflect more light and do not absorb heat, which was also the latest field of research.
Recently, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and researchers at the University of Columbia’s Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics announced that they have found the most efficient way to reverse solar heat and enhance the cooling effect inside buildings.
Early implementation is aimed at.
The white coatings with the highest reflection rate of sunlight ever used titanium oxide, which reached a reflection rate of 85%.
The white paint that already uses titanium oxide is painted on the roofs of buildings in high temperature environments, helping to block solar heat and increase cooling efficiency.
However, the newly discovered is a white paint derived from polyethylene fluoride resin (PTFE) used in the teflon-processed frypan.
This white coating, which applies the Teflon effect, reflects the sunlight to almost 98% and allows for significant heat cuts.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the white paint that unexpectedly used teflon, it is easy to spend without being exposed to the heat.
Maybe that time is coming soon, right?
The roof of a Japanese house seems to be a lot of dark colors, but from now on the white system will become the mainstream.
When is Amazon’s biggest sales event this year?
CNBC on July 21 that Amazon has revealed the postponement of its annual large-scale sale "Prime Day".
It is held annually in July, but this year isly delayed due to the spread of a new coronavirus infection.
A spokesman for Amazon said in a statement that “the details will be announced soon.”
“Prime Day has become a special celebration event we’ve been looking forward to over the past five years.This year will be held at a later time than usual while ensuring the safety of employees and supporting customers and producers.”
However, it said that “the details will be announced soon,” but did not specify a specific date.
In the meantime, we decided to go to India.
Press release on the country’s website.
It was announced on August 6 from 0 a.m. to 48 hours.
Prime Day has been held worldwide at the same time so far, but it may take exceptional steps this year.
Amazon, a large event that sold 760 billion yen in two days, launched a major sale for its members in 2015 as a promotion of a summer market where sales are declining.
Initially it was a 24-hour event, but the scale expanded year after year, last year it was held from 0 a.m. to 48 a.m. on July 15 in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia.
According to the company, two-day sales last year surpassed previous sales of Black Friday (the first day of the end-of-year trade war) and Cyber Monday (the following Monday).
This event has also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers for paid membership "Prime", and last year the number of applications for the first day became the largest number of applications for one day, followed by the following day.
Last year, it sold 150 million goods worldwide.
In this regard, the online retail industry magazine Internet Retail that the two-day global total sales amounted to $7.6 billion ($76 billion), up 70 percent from the previous year.
Moving cell phone numbers and excessive retention.
What about payments and points?
News from Yahoo!
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has approved a review of the same number transfer system (MNP) that would be able to use conventional telephone numbers when changing mobile communications companies.
At a meeting of experts on the 21st, he presented a policy to revise the MNP guidelines adopted in 2004.
The specific arguments range from the way MNP fees exist and from the possibility of withholding those who wish to transfer.
Reactions from telecommunications companies are also expected to be linked to promoting healthy market competition.
The initial user charge fee was 2000 yen in 06 when the black MNP of communications companies was introduced, but now it is 3000 yen.
The MNP fee revenue of three mobile telecommunications giants is estimated at 15.9 billion yen per year.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs listed the current situation around MNP at the “Working Group on the Verification of Competition Rules” (WG) meeting of experts discussing the competitive environment of the communications market.
The receipt time for issuing the MNP reservation number needed when consumers transferred to other telecommunications companies was also highlighted.
Large telecommunications companies are receiving on the web, but due to the convenience of operating the core systems, the receiving time zone is mainly 9-20 hours.
WG documents clearly stated the principle of day-to-day response as the direction of future consideration.
It is also problematic for people who wish to transfer to MNP to seek withholding points from mobile communications companies.
Excessive retention may hinder fair competition.
North Juno, a partner at the WG-member Nohumara Comprehensive Laboratory, suggests that “you take time to explain the economic benefits provided or get permission from the user and immediately issue and terminate the number to the non-permitted users.
However, among a series of topics, the structural problem of MNP charges is that “the higher the customers will find it harder to leak out, so the motivation to actively lower it will be difficult to work” (in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs).
Businesses who are leading the way down the MNP fees are concerned that the company’s customer outflows will increase and the company’s efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also pointed out that many countries do not require user charge fees for MNP abroad, and it is possible that this will happen in Japan.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to summarize the achievements of the WG as a report around September-October, and then start the procedure for revision of the MNP guidelines.
The period of rectification is considered to be 21 years later.
Mobile companies are likely to bother their heads, including sales and customer support.

[G Osaka] 17-year-old FW唐山, what is the possibility of J1 debut in Kobe?
Home » Sports News » Sports News – Yahoo!
G Osaka director宮本恒靖 (43) on the 25th, responded to the interview ahead of the 4th consecutive victory in the Kobe battle (Novesta 26th) and revealed his expectations for high school 3-year-old FW唐山翔自 (17), who joined the top team for the first time in the precinct.
The commander became a bench member in the 22nd Hiroshima battle of Tangshan, who was the top elevator in this season's jumping class.
I didn’t give them a chance, but until now in J3 I’ve seen the strikers who left three points and results in this season’s 5 matches, “there’s a prominent part of taking points. I’m 17 years old, but I want to do more of that. I’ve seen the players go abroad as younger, but I want them to play with a high consciousness and desire.”
Tangshan scored 10 matches and 8 goals in J3 last season as a special designated player.
178 centimeters, 65 kilometers and a small body, but with the sense of taking the back of the DF in instantaneous movements, the calmness of the shoot before the intense opponent goal, J3 boasts 15 matches 11 goals and a remarkable score.
In the battle of Hiroshima, FW Ademiuson and MF O'Nozzi were injured and got off the bench and won a chance, but there was no chance.
In the face of the Kobe battle, the director explained the condition of Ademiuson and O'Neill as "both are not 100%, but they are trying to prepare with high will."
If both of them survive, there will be a chance to enter the bench again in Tangshan.
In G Osaka, MF堂安=now PSV= was 16 years 11 months old, FW宇佐美 made his J1 debut at 17 years 0 months old, and moved to overseas as a 10-year-old.
The current 17-year-old and 10-month-old唐山, who is looking forward to the next talent, is also looking forward to the J1 debut as a successor to them.
Ferrari stolen 26 years ago found at the bottom of a river to work (octane.jp ) - Yahoo! news

The time had passed without the police to solve it, but 26 years later, the World Cup was miraculously discovered.

By matching the VIN number with the database of the stolen car, it was possible to associate this Ferrari with the 1994 incident.
The car is handed over to the insurance company, its legal owner, and then sent to the scraper.
Scraper Lowie van DE Ooyevaar says, “There are still a few remaining parts, but it’s for the art of decorating. I’ve already received a lot of requests from those who want to make tables from the broken World Cup using engine blocks and glass plates.”
In the meantime, we do not think of any specific sales, and it is said that the scraper will store it as an object.

45% of households hold their wallets.
Is my husband happy or unhappy?
“I don’t have enough money this month,” said the husband, “or is there a woman who is upset with her, isn’t it?”
The family in which this conversation is held is the family in which the wife holds the wallet.
How many people in the world have a wallet?
Let us also look at the percentage of “parent portfolios” and “co-managed” together.
Who holds the home wallet?
According to the results of a survey conducted by Matsui Securities Co., Ltd. of 20-30-year-old men and women 400 (young couples) within three years of marriage, 50-60-year-old men and women 400 (mature couples) over 30 years of marriage, and an Internet survey of a total of 800 people, the “Survey on Couples’ Household Management Issues” (published in June 2012).
Who holds your home wallet?
Wife: 45,0% Husband: 24.8% The households where the wife controls the households were the most important results.
Regardless of which one manages, there is an overwhelming turnaround in household management, but there appear to be various episodes.
The wife manages the household: In the case of A’s son, A’s son is Arafif’s Wormma, who has a daughter from high school 3rd and high school 1st.
The family manages the entire household.
Before the university exam, there were a lot of months when the school fee deficit came out, so I negotiated to reduce the salary to my husband, but the proposal was decided to resist.
Then he said, “Tell me what the revenue is,” so I showed the household account.
I should have listed all the expenses, but when I looked at the household account it wasn’t enough to be a deficit.
My husband seemed to be caught up with "it's enough," but A's son didn't think, "I understand, my household account management is inadequate, so please manage everything" and if you cut off the profit, "I'm sure I'll please" will be returned.
Later on, A said in an interview with her husband, “Though I’m dissatisfied with the management of small payments, it’s true that I don’t have time or energy to manage the various outputs of the household (e.g. school teaching materials and PTA expenses).”
The husband manages the household: In the case of B’s son, the dedicated housewife, B’s son, is given the cost of living from her husband and is being cut off every day.
Last spring, the refrigerator part of the freezer was broken and B’s wife asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
But the husband said, “I can’t buy the freezer, but I can still use the part of the refrigerator because it’s okay.”
However, in the summer, the husband himself wanted to set up an environment where he could eat ice cream at any time and said, “Choose a refrigerator.”
Therefore, B’s son complained to his friend that “her husband is so ugly as he is.”
