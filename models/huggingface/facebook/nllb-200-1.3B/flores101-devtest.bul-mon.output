Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is now widely accepted, but it also gives details that fossils generally don't provide, like color and three-dimensional layout.
The feathers of this animal were brownish brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed handle called a rachis, but do have other feather features  branches and hooks, the researchers conclude that the rachis is probably a later evolutionary development, compared to other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight, but rather for temperature control or parade. According to the researchers, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult specimen, not chicken feathers.

You use satellite when you're calling someone who's thousands of miles away.
Satellite in space receives the call and almost instantly bounces it back.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope in space, you need a giant rocket that's over 100 feet tall.

below are medium-sized cats feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) who feed on far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat takes on, which keeps it from competing with others.
Leos are the most social cats, living in large groups called pride.
The larvae consist of one to three adult blood-related males, along with up to 30 females and juveniles.
The females are usually closely related, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Pride behaves much like pack wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behaviour, and equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as a well-rounded athlete, can climb (though not well), swim, make huge jumps, and pull with the strength of five healthy people.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger's roar does not exactly resemble the lion's roar, but rather resembles the utterance of rumble, screaming words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and almost all the animals the ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
scientists think that ocelots track and find prey animals by their sense of smell, by sniffing about where they were on the ground.
With their night vision, they see very well in the dark and move very quietly, the ocelots hunt their prey by merging with the environment and raiding their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it passes through a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it is difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
As time goes on, as the new population starts to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the rest of the population.
After all, thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can't be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Species formation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans expel.
Plantations produce their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of them. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The Mosaic was the greatest predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing except other Mosaics.
Long jaws were sewn with over 70 razor-toothed blades, along with an extra set of razor blades at the top of his mouth, meaning there was no salvage for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a split tongue, and his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have even been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that went into the water; it couldn't compete with even a giant dinosaur like T. rex.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also had some rather strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called sunflowers
The other difference was that while poor men and women ate, sitting on chairs, rich men liked to make banquets together, lying aside while they ate.
It's not possible that the ancient Roman cuisine included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no potatoes, no tomatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a magnificent temple to each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of the god.

Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which was only open to priests.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers called ziggurats were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
The majority of Jewish family life is spent outdoors.

The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.

It's likely that the notation was just added as a label.
With the D-Day landings and the ensuing battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was not yet free.
It's run by the French from Vichy, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies entered southern France on 15 August 1940 and the invasion was called Operation Dragon.
Within just two weeks, American and French forces are liberating southern France and heading for Germany.
Civilization represents a culture shared by a significant and large group of people working and living together, a society.
civilization comes from the Latin wordcivilis, which means civil, related to the Latin wordscivis or citizen and civitas, which is also city or city-state, and this somehow determines the size of society.
Culture in the context of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and natural diffusion.
THE CULTURES OF THE WORLD
Throughout the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government, and under the Articles of Confederation, the Congress was its only component.

Nor does he have the authority to veto tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The clauses required the unanimous consent of all states to be amended, and states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.

Popular sports include football, volleyball, basketball, cycling, water polo, fencing, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
The northern regions are most popular with winter sports, with Italians competing in both international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan owns nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!

Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes in local grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu features three main structures, namely the Temple of the Sun, Intihwana, and the Room of the Three Windows.


The most common still photography format in the world, for example, is 35 mm. This was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
still being produced today, but more importantly, its image format is inherited from the sensor image formats of digital cameras.
35mm is actually, somewhat confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer denominator) is therefore 3:2.
Equal to or very close to this ratio are very common formats (e.g. APS group formats).
The much-abused and often-mocked rule of thirds is simply a rule that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the most appropriate place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines separating the third-party photo vertically and horizontally (see example).

The Christian religion has united the nations of Europe for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.

The centralization of the church in Rome has continued for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been adhered to.
UK began a naval blockade of Germany

UK mines international waters to prevent ships from entering entire ocean areas, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
e the response to this tactic is limited, Germany expects a similar response to its unlimited war effort with submarines.
In the 1920s, most citizens and nations had a prevailing attitude of pacifism and isolation.

To accept a job at the Edison Company in New York, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poetry and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
In ancient China, there was a unique way to represent different time periods; for each stage of history or for each ruling family, there was a separate dynasty.
The most famous of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
during these periods there was a fierce war between many nobles fighting for the throne.

There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just to one ruler.
Also after the Revolution, the classes were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of the division in the army being class-based, it's now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. To meditate, he often visited the cave that became known as Hira on Mount Nur (light).
The cave itself, which has survived the test of time, conveys a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Situated on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
actually, it's not easy to find it, even if you know it exists. once you get inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
Nothing to see except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists.

The Great Pyramid is dedicated to Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples are dedicated to his wives and family members.
up is like a V, and down is like a telobod or a square with no bottom.
Up means you have to start at the top and press the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and then pull it out.
A bow pointing up usually makes a softer sound, and a bow pointing down is stronger and more confident.
Feel free to put your own signs, but remember that the printed bowstrings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Theresa, age 11, and Louis Charles, age 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of women in the marketplace.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, one of the crowd waved to the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
Filipinos themselves paid the military expenses of US imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines.
The US colonial regime forced them to pay taxes to cover much of the expense and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
The surplus profits from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people are, of course, the main gains of US imperialism.
To understand the meaning of Templarism, we must be clear about the context that gave rise to the Order.
The period in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the Late Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The real Middle Ages was preceded by the Early and followed by the Late, which by convention ends around 1500.
"TECHNOLOGICAL DETERMINISM" is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by logic, related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Two general ideas are shared between most interpretations of technological determinism: either the development of technology itself is going on a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, or technology itself is affecting inherent rather than socially conditioned societies.
t, for example, one might say that the motor vehicle inevitably leads to the development of roads.
though a nationwide road network will not be economically viable for just a handful of cars, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Car ownership has also led to a higher incidence of road accidents, which has necessitated the invention of new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romantism contains a large element of cultural determinism, originated by writers such as Goethe, Ficht and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, customs and culture emerged associated with this geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Paris being the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is considered to be the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury dates back to around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC.
The status of the church declined in the 12th century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as spices and silk, which were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.

Gothic reached its peak between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.

Through the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to tie their clothes, which was one of the greatest developments of the time.

The Commission has also assessed the feasibility of the project and the potential for further improvement.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded people who feel left out by societal standards. They allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical nature or a combination of factors.

One of the most commonly used tools to illustrate the importance of socialization is the example of several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, mistreatment or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during the child's growing years.
neopitomeni or wild. Some untamed children were held captive by humans (usually their own parents); sometimes the abandonment of such children was due to the rejection of severe intellectual or physical disability of the child by the parents.
The wild children may have been severely abused or traumatized before they were abandoned or fled.
others are thought to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully animal-bred, the wild child demonstrates behaviour (within physical limitations) almost entirely similar to that of the particular caregiver animal, as well as his fear or indifference to humans.

Construction of a ladder is not a training method, but rather an aid that provides support to individuals going through a new learning process, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scales can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of scales, and so is the little guy with the clamps in Microsoft Office.
The software has built-in virtual skeletons that are designed to ask questions, remind and explain procedures that might be too difficult for the student to handle on their own.

No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, caring and educational, but it is happening.
We feel the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving people to care for, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care is supposed to provide everything necessary that was missing in the home from which they were taken.
Internet combines elements of both mass and individual communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the use of the satisfaction approach.
learning and socializing are cited as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement andsustained relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Imay and McCord (1998), when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
It is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sachs, in his work "The President's Speech", points out how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are able to perceive a sincere attitude.
He even suggested that similar abilities to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th century studies have shown that there are 2 groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
segregação e recombinação mistura as variações para trás e para trás entre os dois pools com cada geração.
In the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its amino acid requirement through available plant resources.
Plus, the consequences of failure are severe: growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources to get are the proteins from the leaves and seeds of the legumes, but they're hard for us to digest unless we cook them.
The food of animal origin (termites, ants, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a high amount of proteins, which contain all the essential amino acids.

interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual sleep time and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
lf you find yourself turning the clock off in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The less stress, the more positive the life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
anyone can achieve enlightenment. our own tension and negativity are the only things that stand in the way of achieving this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is extended by many techniques from Indian Yoga and the Mahayana way of love.
Tibetan Buddhism is built on a very simple principle. consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Germany was a common enemy during WWII, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, differences between the system, process and culture led to conflict between these countries.
2 years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the cold war had begun.
It continued for the next 40 years, and a real battle was fought through mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Cuba, to Afghanistan, and many other places.
September 17, 1939 Polish defenses are already broken and their only hope is to retreat along the Romanian landing strip and reorganize themselves.

The use of cargo ships is the most efficient way to transport huge numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
The role of the navy is traditionally to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
one of the most recent notable examples of this was the north atlantic campaign during world war ii where the americans tried to move people and supplies across the atlantic ocean to help the british.

Goats were probably first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Goats were usually raised on herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often accompanied by goats, who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd.
The railway lines were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Though the rails consisted of just parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to achieve greater speed and to pull larger loads than on the more uneven roads of the time.
Travers were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place, but gradually it was realized that rails would be more effective with a strip of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Gradually wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known way to move was by walking, and humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sakhalanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.

In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.

After being passed by Congress on the 4th of July and signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, the manuscript was sent to the John Dunlap printing press located a few blocks away.
"Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as Dunlap broadsides".
The document was first read out publicly by John Nix in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
one was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops on July 9th in New York. a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 one-sided copies of Dunlap on large sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.

Almost all computers in use today operate on the basis of manipulating information which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Poisoning internally does not always manifest immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals may be the best indication for internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "bubble" is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both flying bugs and common bugs are colorless, living in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among youths and middle-aged people.

Studies show that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the parental rights of the biological parents are terminated, after which the other couple can be the parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method.
Not only is experimentation, although experiments are also used to eliminate some of the possible hypotheses, the asking of questions and the use of guides also accompany scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers work more with classical texts, and in particular with the Latin Bible.
Aristotelis's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of Greek declined, the West was cut off from its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
In physiology and behavior, many of the observed rhythms often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
periodic rhythms, which are more than reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to perform a free-movement cycle even if there are no external signals.
One of the leading theories that DNA is genetic material was the experiment that Hershey and Chase did.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they either tagged the DNA of phage with radioactive phosphorus, or their protein with radioactive sulfur.
depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells, mutations can have a wide range of effects.
Only mutations in cells from the germ line can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is attractive to people who are interested in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wild plant and animal species.
The activities that can be carried out here are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
Visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo are examples of this.

Thanks to the fact that drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range, traffic flows have some logical sequence and can be represented approximately mathematically.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics are defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
The Commission considers that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid their enemies more easily and to find food and to breed more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back over their body.

Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as normal teams, but there are subtle differences.
The virtual team members often function as a point of contact with their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
(Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
Invisible team is the management team to which each member reports.This team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? Innovation is in fact one of the goals of implementing the concepts of organisational learning.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be manifested.
