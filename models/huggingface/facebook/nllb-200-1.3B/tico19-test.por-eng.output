Rapidly progressive cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that while at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and UTIs should prepare more for an outbreak of COVID-19 patients who will need care and, especially, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a portion of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to a more serious illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases progress to a critical illness requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 has spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
The March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 to supplement this Regulation by laying down detailed rules on the application of this Regulation.
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the countries' Ministries of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8 a.m.
This data was used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported for each country by 15 March 2020 at 8am, and compare it with Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK overall followed those in Hubei Province in China (Figure 1).
Overall, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and increased significantly thereafter around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It highlights that by 15 March at 8am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in cumulative COVID-19 incidence suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar pace in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems, and possibly different country case definitions and different protocols for selecting patients who should be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including testing for updating.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization for COVID-19 cases in a hospital and/or a TIU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic manner to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
A study carried out between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of IU and SIC beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal per 100 000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 IUD and SIDS beds for a population of 100 000 in 2010-2011).
Modelled scenarios related to health system capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalizations associated with a risk of more than 90% of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment.
Since cases have so far been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and ICUs generally serve a defined population of regional scope, information on cases and ICUs should preferably be made available in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
The example of Italy and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and UTs should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care, especially intensive care, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions properly, if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to step up their control initiatives to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will have an outbreak of patients requiring intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
Meanwhile, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible, and it affects older people more than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the new disease, this article aims to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the research subject, which is developing rapidly.
We will cover the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope this study will help in understanding and eradicating this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to stay confined for the entire holiday and for several subsequent weeks due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus bears a strong resemblance to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the respective disease was named CoV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovering and more than 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number one", and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequencing of the virus isolated from several patients.
This article aims to summarize the progress of research in this new and rapidly developing area.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as other pressing issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds.
However, we've found two highly pathogenic human CoVs this century, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic that originated in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and that soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
So the current COVID-19 is the third COVID epidemic in recorded human history.
As demonstrated in Fig. Fig.1.1, a portion of pneumonia cases with unknown origins was initially reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequencing was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case in Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, contagion from healthcare workers was reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, Wuhan city was closed, with all public transportation disrupted.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of the start of the infection by an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease had spread to China and almost 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. (Fig.2).2).
As the situation is rapidly deteriorating, the final extent and severity of the epidemic is yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, mainly in the age group of 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, some were under 20, and only 14 infected were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in groups, mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time to death based on onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The baseline number of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people grew exponentially before 23 January 2020, corresponding to the time of mass transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality in patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a single strand of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha-coronavirus and beta-coronavirus are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively and membrane fusion subsequently occurs.
The genome of the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing viruses, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of betacoronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the same original outbreak site, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of the epithelium of the human airways.
Human ECA2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human protein ECA2 more weakly than the SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of human full-length ECA2 at a resolution of 2,9 Å in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for screening of drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The originator and the intermediary
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered to be the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like bat CoVs named bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
Meanwhile, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross species barriers and infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission has yet to be discovered.
Ji et al. suggest that snakes carry the virus from bats to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins, elongated-snouted mammals that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the 99% genetic homology between a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a large difference; therefore conclusive results for concrete tests are awaited (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are for the most part still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with 40% to 50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only consult previous studies on other CoVs, especially on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptor (TLR), NOD-type receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-type receptor (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus escape the immune response.
Before long, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
Collaborative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help in the defense of the cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including complementary antibodies such as C3a and C5a, is also essential for fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated immune system reaction generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, multiple organ failure, even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, affects older people with comorbidities and pregnant women more.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a higher chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and most often 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thereby preventing infected persons who do not show symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, individuals exposed to or infected with the virus usually need to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended by 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which may come on its own or be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, corneas, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have experienced dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia one week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In severe cases, patients progressed rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulation.
Patients with fever and/ or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in the diagnosis by lung imaging, should be screened for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster with transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients required ventilation support much more than COVID-19 patients, which consists of higher mortality from MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and sore throat (13% to 25%) were shown to be the main symptoms, and ventilation support was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
As of February 14, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%, when the world's confirmed cases reached 66,576.
By comparison, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the basic R0 reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4 only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and with SARS-CoV with respect to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table Table1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The onset of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same group or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients generally have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing symptoms, and cured patients who have been discharged from hospitals can contract the virus again, which raises an alarm for extending the quarantine time.
Patients have normal or reduced numbers of peripheral white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count below 4 x 109/L including a lymphocyte count below 1 x 109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Levels of enzymes and myoglobins in the muscle and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and red cell sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, was elevated and the lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are present in most COVID-19 patients, and they present bilateral irregular shadows or opaque dark glass in the lungs.
Patients usually developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely impair gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocytes dysfunction decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the lung's ability to expand, and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most severe chest X-ray results usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the peeling of pneumocytes, formation of the hyaline membrane, infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and syncytial cells into the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase  reverse transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which has now been derived not only from RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to reach an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microliter of input) using a measuring rod in less than one hour, without the need for complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, physicians can provide, to the best of their ability, palliative treatment for COVID-19 patients, while at the same time trying a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed previously for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovering patients has been suggested as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified alternative cardiopulmonary technique used for the treatment of severe heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
The cytokine cascade is known to result from the exacerbated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, are being used to treat the cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for the cytokine cascade include modulation of the targeted immune response to T cells; blocking of IFN-y, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAKs, blinatumomab; suppressor of 4 cytokine signaling; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause serious side effects, mainly avascular osteonecrosis, drastically affecting prognosis.
However, short periods of low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroid treatment have been recommended for cautious use in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
Meanwhile, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir has also been shown to potentially inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead supplied the compound to China to conduct some tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be monitored closely.
Plasma from cured patients and antibody generation
The collection of blood from patients who have been cured of a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contracting the disease has a long history.
In fact, cured patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in their blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight off pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19, and injected into 10 patients in a critical condition.
His symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are needed in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients in a critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight an epidemic of global scale.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or to screen for effective antibodies against essential virus proteins.
So we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend enormously on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of TCM.
Most of the effective components remain unknown, or are vague, as it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The best cure rates of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, achieved the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between Western medicine exclusive treatment and Western medicine combined treatment with TCM.
It was found that the time required for body temperature recovery, for symptom resolution and for hospitalization was considerably shorter in the Western medicine and TCM group than in the Western medicine group alone.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the Western medicine and TCM group than for the Western medicine alone group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the Western medicine and TCM group than in the Western medicine alone group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await further, properly controlled testing at larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are generally very afraid of the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritable.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early phase of the SARS epidemic, various psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychosis symptoms, delusions, and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of the public health system's actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and the stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people suspected of the disease and people who have had contact with them, as well as the general population in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and on treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the chain of transmission from reservoirs of infected animals and people to susceptible hosts, and are usually complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives have been taken to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate potent and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older subjects and their lethal challenge patterns and protection against zoonotic virus infection have yet to be determined before the start of a clinical trial.
This is probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long period (18 months on average) required for the development of a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its full clinical evolution, affecting thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without any side effects.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
So building a prognostic model for disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with scarce resources.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table (Table33):
Age: age was the most important factor in the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily affects people between the ages of 30 and 65, with 47.7% of patients being over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive treatment were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not require intensive treatment (mean age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive treatment are more likely to suffer acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Heart attacks were the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ECA2-positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It's important to note that age and underlying disease have a strong correlation and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and eventual recovery.
The correlation of CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also aid in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are present in abundance in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So they're traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues for predicting outcomes/complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants typically used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
As high doses of corticosteroids have been widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors have suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low dose and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress as they go through long quarantine periods and uncertainties, and witness the death of loved ones and other patients.
Providing psychological counseling and lasting support is essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from the characteristics of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and causes no symptoms in the early stage of infection (or only mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or in the incubation period may produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty for epidemic control.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV has been considered to occur when patients are severely ill, with most transmissions not occurring at the early stage.
So the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Major efforts are currently being made in China, including the containment of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population, in the hope of stopping the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic will end by March, and the slowdown will last between 3 and 4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and mid-cornea swabs of patients who had recovered and been discharged from hospital within the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the newly identified virus may become a flu-like cyclical episode.
However, promising indications have emerged in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, may become weaker in its infectivity and, at some point, become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing and sneezing and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, which raises a new possibility: that of oral-fecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 healthcare professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially healthcare professionals, social workers, family members, co-workers and people in direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defence that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series No. 1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected individual from being carried into the air or from sticking to the surfaces of objects where they can infect other people.
However, only N95 masks (series No. 1860s) protect against inhalation from viruses with a size of 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of viruses being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since particulate matter can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals should wear isolation vests to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent face shields or protective eyewear when attending patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay home in isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
One meter is considered an appropriate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus to humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have caused a major alert to China based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of Wuhan's Disease Control Center reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of transmission and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message made people more relaxed, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for containing the disease in Wuhan on a minimal scale was missed.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, such agencies should: (1) be more cautious in making public pronouncements, as everything they say is absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information coming from hospitals, rather than waiting for formal statements from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive in containing a potential epidemic in its early stages, rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) issue more frequently targeted and effective simulations to raise public awareness about epidemic diseases and periodically test and improve society's response system.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world as of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic has generated a sense of SARS coming back.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are seriously ill, which makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can test positive for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several crucial questions still need to be addressed, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologue has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat CoVs, we cannot yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, say, the bat, to humans?
Without the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut off the transmission and the epidemic could recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and an effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or have a seasonal recurrence like the flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to find answers to the above questions and many others.
However, whatever efforts are required, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause a mild illness, like a common cold.
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed what was thought about CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating an HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put CoVs in the spotlight again and surprised everyone with its high transmissibility and its reduced pathogenicity compared to its sibling SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is of great use.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are nonpathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of disease in humans.
Investigation of animal CoV host interactions may also provide important information on human CoV pathogenesis.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing information on the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that we do comparison and contrast between different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current epidemic of CoV 2019 (COVID-19) disease is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of encapsulated, positive polarity and single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which have the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, have been termed "CoVs" because of their crown morphology when observed under an electron microscope.
As for the structure, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two overlapping open-reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
The polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins designated nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific lineage accessory proteins are also encoded by different strains of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV, and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV genus contains the majority of HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed species boundaries, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the bark of common cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people, with a gross case-related mortality rate of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm is sounding, and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is coming.
All seven HCoVs are of zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where the viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This may also guide and facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in preventing future viral migration between species.
In this article, we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlighted and discussed the common theme that parental HCoVs are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoVs, in which increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of the B814 strain of HCoV-229E from the bark of patients who contracted the common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the last decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted for growth in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have had symptoms of the common cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in lactating mice brains.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
Overall, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, with the disease accompanied for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have developed severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS was in 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across several countries and continents.
With the exception of the "super-spreaders", it has been estimated that each infected person can infect approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the onset of the peak viral load on the tenth day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by later symptoms of dyspnea, coughing and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, hepatic dysfunction and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophage counts are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients require intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation at some point.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys may also be affected in these severe cases, usually with a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy from a relative of patient zero who was traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of rickets, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered throughout the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring, and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63 that was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Overall, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to persist continuously in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which is characterised by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very peculiar to MERS among HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high confirmed case-related mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to man.
From mid to late December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which was known retrospectively to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross case-related mortality rate of 3.4%.
It is noted that the fatality related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the fatality outside that city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, as do SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they may contribute to the rapid spread of the virus in the world.
Comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease evolution are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four community-acquired HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presence of nonspecific, mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is somewhat lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns in both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
It remains to be clarified in future studies whether or-faecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 may exhibit seasonality, as in cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity, and sustained spread after its passage to humans, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of past HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and people who develop severe disease from HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to humans.
If adaptation is adequate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
The four Community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in human populations for several years, causing the common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans, and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and take the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible, as are community-acquired HCoVs, at least so far.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It remains to be found whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among us without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbors a directly related ancestor, sharing high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and nonpathogenic to that host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts HCoV continuously and durably.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host shortly before or near its introduction to humans, it does not adapt adequately to the new host, and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmit it to humans and increase the scale of human infection.
An HCoV may have infection stopped if it cannot sustain its transmission at the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that SARS patient zero had a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a hound dog in live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no further SARS was reported after the slaughter of all civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild or farmed masked palm civets without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets could be only the amplifier intermediate host but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that various species of small mammals could serve as amplifying intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All of these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, named SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese horseshoe bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no CoV, with the exception of the designated WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) is known to be the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from bat fecal samples has been shown to use bat, civet and human ECA2 as a receptor for entry into cells.
It's intriguing that the serum from recovering SARS patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to the homologues in bat betaCoVs identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive for MERS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies, as are Middle Eastern camels in several African countries.
Live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from nasal swabs of dromedaries, increasing evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that generally mild symptoms, but with massive virus transmission, have been observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels transmit viruses not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of viruses in bats.
However, answers are still lacking as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which can plausibly be attributed to transmission between people or to transmission routes involving unidentified animal species harbouring MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat RaTG13 CoV, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless near-identical bat CoVs are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that the animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be set up between wild species sold and slaughtered at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, to which many of the early cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also harbor SARS-CoV-2 related ancestral betaCoVs.
These new pangolim CoV genomes share 85% to 92% homology in nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also similarly directly related to RaTG13, with about 90% identical nucleotide sequence.
They group into sub-lines of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In a huge contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 DLRs are more divergent, although they exhibit a high degree of sequential homology across the genome.
A recent study on diseased pangolins also reported the detection of consensus viral sequences from lung samples that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used different configuration and manual curation methods to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to confirm the direct origin of pangolin SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related betaCoVs.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 related betaCoVs of pangolins.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has yet to be elucidated.
While the highest sequence homology was found in DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the SARS-CoV-2 related betaCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest broad genomic sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the DLRs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin betaCoVs stems from selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
A contrary argument is made for recombination between SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin betaCoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is highly present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat CoVs, while the parental viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were discovered in rodents.
A bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American Tricolor Bat was reported to be directly related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and chameleons are also suspected to be its intermediate hosts.
For clarity, current knowledge on the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarised in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species and infected humans from domestic animals around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlphaCoVs from bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been discovered.
Among them is an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, but not alpacas, can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have direct contact with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alphaCoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphaCoVs have caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphaCoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas obtaining HCoV-229E-related alphaCoV from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that are pathogenic to humans, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as the HCoV-229E gene pool, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has been corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, high-density colonies, close social interaction, and high flight capability are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "virus spreaders".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV in dromedaries goes back decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and has migrated from an intermediate host to a natural, stable reservoir host.
MERS-CoV is a mild disease causer and has a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is accidental, and humans remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, as its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Specifically, pangolin betaCoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for SARS-CoV-2 related betaCoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the amplifier intermediate hosts, into which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has been newly introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is needed.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered to be 'moderate' to 'high' with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, per site, depending on the adaptation phase of the CoV to new hosts.
CoVs have exoribonuclease with revision mechanism, exclusion of which results in excessively high mutability and attenuation, or even inoperability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog remdesivir suppresses CoV replication by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Moreover, the mutation rate is usually high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low, suggesting its higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, it has already adapted to another host that maintains contact with humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in modifying the genome for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of interspecies coevolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and protein functions encoded relative to the last three inches of the genome's end.
Third, CoVs swap patterns randomly and frequently during RNA replication by means of a unique 'copy-choice' mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing vessel, tape exchange occurs frequently during transcription of CoV RNA.
Long highly homologous and subgenomic RNAs can recombine to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Host-virus interaction with regard to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between isolates of SARS-CoVs from humans and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with mutations in the S protein DLR.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is selectively targeted by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is at the 318th to 510th amino acids in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ECA2 as well as its correceptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV DLR is able to recognize the ECA2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing for interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only six amino acid residues were observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in the DLR, and four of them are located in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
Cytate SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implies that the binding affinity of its S protein to human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, an electron cryomicroscopy study indicates a 10 to 20 times greater affinity for this link than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other correceptor may be necessary for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of the S protein.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetyl for HCoV-OC43.
They could also account for the effective adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other host-dependent and restriction factors.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp host-dependence factors and subvert host-restriction factors for effective interspecies transmission.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction have yet to be identified and characterised.
Non-bias screening with genome-wide reach of host-dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to square one
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid genetic mutation and recombination also drive the evolution of HCoVs and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is believed to be important in its adaptation to humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated, but they have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A nucleotide 29 exclusion feature of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with lineages of alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that epidemic MERS-CoV has undergone cross-line recombination events, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, probably resulting from the relief of selection pressure on viruses, such as the pressure on the host immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses, alpaca alphaCoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a change in the frames.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure on their reservoir hosts.
No symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
Bats are likely to be well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell inhibitor receptor and the low degree of expression of the class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ERO) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease revision, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoVs could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
So it's no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic, or at most cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without triggering a high immune response from the host.
This document explains the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of severe cases in humans.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and the cytokine cascade, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was disconnected from CoV replication.
The same strategy of immune response switching off could have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of interferon type I at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is deficient.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While it has been discovered that bat betaCoV shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a bat CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals in markets have been found to harbor viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs from pangolins, with high homology to SARS-CoV-2, have been discovered, indicating that pangolins may serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or betaCoVs from pangolins may contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by humans accidentally or intentionally.
CoVs have returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human-to-human transmission.
Widespread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civets in markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in those markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission in the face of the discovery of multiple betaCoV strains of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans via pangolins and other mammals, and how it is transmitted, is yet to be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transportation, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather, and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to slaughter all camels for MERS control as was done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
Specifically, the CoVs of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crises, a better response and preparedness plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there's a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people will be in contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing transmission from animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for people to stay away from ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, how people come into contact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal is the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
If it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parent viruses will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for 'suspect case' and 'confirmed case' of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid guidance guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 (2019-nCoV) novel coronavirus infection. This guide conveys our experience and is a good reference for combating this global pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the constant discoveries of research and experience in clinical practice; because of this, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 (2019-nCoV) coronavirus caused an outbreak, which is now officially termed as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted excellent attention since publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the constant discoveries of research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in context in some.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We endorse your significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs updating according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, one item of the epidemiological history elements must be combined with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or three items of clinical manifestations must be fulfilled if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and nearby areas or in other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious SARS-CoV-2 cases (positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and nearby areas or from other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (greater than or equal to two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging capabilities of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count exhibiting normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the early stage of symptom onset.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the complete viral genome exhibiting high homogeneity to the new known coronaviruses; (3) positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies in serum testing; or any change of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody from negative to positive or increase in titer greater than or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can note that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples has been added to the second and third edition (of 18 and 22 January 2020 respectively).
Pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth editions (27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020 respectively), and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped to bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is growing evidence that reminds us to look out for atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated as it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in further studies and clinical practice.
In conclusion, we await further direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspect case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that you check and follow the latest guidelines from your home countries.
Our team will also update our guide to help you in a timely manner.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, highest daily
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths on the day.
That's the highest number of deaths in one day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research of Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news report, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two were between 51 and 60 years of age, and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video online statement, Bengal's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport would be paralyzed for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport shutdown began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential goods (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on 8 March, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million, data from Johns Hopkins University indicated.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. from coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the complete blockade of the city until May 1.
On the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to be paid without coming to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the entire day, previously from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew from 10pm to 4am
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce toilet paper limits by transaction
On Saturday and Sunday night, Australian retail chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the restrictions on buying toilet paper to two packages and one package per transaction, respectively, at all stores in the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a one-package limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages on the boxes and Facebook pages of the networks.
In fear of COVID-19, shoppers were supposedly stocking up in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited home delivery toilet paper purchases to one package per order.
These changes came after the previous four-pack per transaction restriction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, reported that even with the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still running out of stock in less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales had a "significant increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco's store in Camberra also limited the allowance to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made available early stock from a promotion planned for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers try to increase inventory, but that restrictions by the local board on the frequency of truck deliveries make this difficult.
He expects high production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after early stock release, some stores will not be able to hold the Wednesday promotion.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores replenish their inventory every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that when it is sold out, it leaves many empty shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion [that] if there was an abundance on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and antiseptics could be [purchased] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday they'd run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24/7 to maintain supply, according to a News.com.au report.
Real estate website domain.com reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to early bidders at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being held with buyers coming in on the extended Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a Darwin daily, included an eight-page insert intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Initially, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on shopping.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited its purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packs.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of COVID-19  the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus  to be a pandemic.
While the word "pandemic" indicates only the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to push governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize populations for a response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is an "unprecedented" pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "apart from influenza, no other respiratory virus has been monitored from its emergence to its continued global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we have never seen a pandemic started by a coronavirus".
And he went on, "and we've never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time".
The new pandemic status follows the January decision by WHO to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that the outbreak "will get worse in a nutshell".
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, was declared an international public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known specific antiviral vaccine or treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping people away, and monitoring and isolating people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and the closure of establishments.
The pandemic has caused severe global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic-induced shopping.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The majority of cases were linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus causing the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has close links to the bat, pangolin and SARS-CoV coronaviruses. The first person with symptoms known to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019 and had no visible connections to the later group of the seafood market.
Of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to be market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case pointed to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei province, which may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that as new reported cases were decreasing in China but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had surpassed the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 or under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose tests have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and several countries had official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, it was estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections had gone undetected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may be much higher, as it may not include people who died without being tested, for example, who died at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official count of COVID deaths by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the official death toll] is underestimated", a statement corroborated by episodic underreporting reports in the U.S. This underestimation often occurs in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
By February 28, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and general health.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall fatality rate is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the fatality rate fell from 17.3% (in people with onset of symptoms between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other measures include the fatality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not static in time and follow a specific infection population through case resolution.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the infection-lethal rate for the pandemic overall is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University stated that "without proper control, infectious epidemics usually peak and then decline when no more hosts are available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any adequate projection at the moment as to when it will occur".
The Chinese government's senior medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "it could be over by June" if all countries mobilize to follow WHO recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably continue to circulate for a year or two".
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated: "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, since it's highly transmissible" and "that it could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of the re-emergence will depend on the group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively nonspecific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion production (catarrh), loss of olfactory sensation, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and blue-colored face or lips. It is advisable to seek medical help if these symptoms are present.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but with test results that confirm infection, so researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a confirmed infected person be monitored and examined closely to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days, but is usually five days.As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and subsequently dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are yet to be determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and by small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or talking, with close contact considered to be 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering your mouth can cause droplets to reach from 15 to 27 feet (4.5 to 8.2 m).
Some people have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation.
The droplets may land in the mouths and noses of people nearby or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in airborne spread.
Spread can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches one's own eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread through feces, the risk of this happening is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There have been positive tests for the disease up to three days before symptoms emerge, suggesting that transmission is possible even before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three other people.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard and for up to four hours on copper.
Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans, but British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus resemble those of related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B). Two strains of this same lineage are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity, across the genome level, to other bat-derived coronavirus samples (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolin virus and that of humans.
Comparison of the whole genome so far has found at most 92% sharing of genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but definitive confirmation is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography (CT).
A study done in Wuhan comparing rRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its imaging characteristics coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT be used for screening or as a front-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test may be done on breath or blood samples.
The results are usually available from a few hours to days.
This test is usually performed in nasopharyngeal swab, although throat swab is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that can detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these had been shown to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for general use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The peculiarities of X-ray and CT images of symptomatic persons include asymmetrical peripheral opacity in dark glass and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is putting together an international online database of imaging results in confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that while the imaging is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a research tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed for detecting characteristics of virus imaging with X-rays and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands, coughing or sneezing on a paper towel and placing this towel directly in a waste container.
It's advised that anyone who's been infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted or discouraged non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. Healthcare professionals caring for individuals who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use.As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Some misconceptions about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash, which has proven ineffective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, however, several organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective coat.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum alcohol content of 60%, when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises against touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (within one minute of disinfectant exposure to a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 6271%, isopropyl alcohol at 50100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0,5% and iodopovidone at 0,27,5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in the event of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in a location such as an office or daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and electronic boxes used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a paper towel when coughing or sneezing, and immediately discarding any towel.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of movement of exhalation droplets when talking, sneezing, or coughing.
WHO has published instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing masks can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without proper hand hygiene".
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their own face.
In several countries, the use of face masks by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical face masks made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when coming into close contact with another person (stay 1 meter or less apart).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a surgical mask when using public transportation or when staying in crowded places.
Health authorities in Thailand are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without wearing a mask or covering your nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that everyone wear a face mask when going out in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has required that everyone entering supermarkets must wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents have been asked to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has required passengers on inter-city trains and buses to wear face masks from April 1.
In Panama, the use of face masks is mandatory when going out, while at the same time, it has been recommended to produce masks at home for those who cannot afford to buy them.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing down the transmission of disease, by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping centres.
Social distancing methods can be applied by everyone by staying at home, limiting their travels, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact greetings, and keeping distance from others.
At the moment, many governments are mandating or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no knowledge of COVID-19 transmission in a region) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.[citation needed] Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face a higher risk of serious illnesses and complications, with the CDC advising them to stay home as much as possible in areas of community epidemics.[citation needed] In late March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, virtually or at a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to implications that complete social isolation was needed rather than encouraging contact by other alternative means.Some authorities have published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Home self-isolation has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have required or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive self-quarantine instructions were issued for those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate those infected, as well as introduce other infection control measures and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are made to reduce it: the measures now taken are aimed at slowing down the spread and reducing its adverse effects on the health system as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures may be taken simultaneously or in combination.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic to a baseline reproduction rate of less than 1. Managing an infectious disease outbreak is partly about trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, face masks and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling events leading to congestion; community involvement to stimulate acceptance and participation in these interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning of contact surfaces. The most drastic measures to contain the outbreak were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak became clear. For example, entire cities were quarantined and travel bans imposed.
Other countries have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea, for example, introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, those infected were given financial support when they quarantined themselves, and those who did not were severely fined.
In Taiwan, there has been an increase in the production of face masks and those who stockpile medical supplies have been punished. Simulations conducted in the United Kingdom and the United States show that reduction (slowing the speed of transmission without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (i.e. reversing the growth of the epidemic) present major challenges.
Ideal reduction policies could reduce peak demand for health services by two-thirds and deaths by half, yet still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, while also overburdening health systems.
Suppression may be the best alternative, but it must be maintained as long as there is circulation of the virus through the human population or until a vaccine is available, if that happens sooner.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic carries with it social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug that is specific to COVID-19, however, there are efforts towards drug development, which include testing of existing drugs.
Using nonprescription cold medications, drinking plenty of fluids, and resting may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection or respiratory assistance may be required.
Steroid use can make the condition worse.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some "homemade and traditional" medicines can relieve symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes capacity building and adapting health care to the needs brought about by COVID-19 as fundamental measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Office for Europe issued guidance for hospitals and primary health care services to shift their resources at various levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, the cancellation of non-compulsory procedures and the separation and isolation of patients with positive COVID-19 test results, as well as increased intensive care capacities through staff training and increased available beds and ventilators.
There are various theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the novel coronavirus was on 1 December 2019, in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in the region gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market. The market also sold live animals, leading to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed to have a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients were observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital. The next day, the doctor informed the Wuhan Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Center.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-type coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for sounding the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31 issued a statement to the population and informed the WHO.
Enough cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, facilitated by the Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub as well as a major railway connection point.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Later official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed the symptoms by January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States overtook China and Italy, with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. By April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people had died, and more than 364,000 had recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The countries' reactions included containment measures, such as quarantines (also known as home confinement orders, home confinement orders or lockdowns) and curfews.As of 2 April, about 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are in some form of confinement in the United States, over 50 million people are in confinement in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in confinement in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are in confinement in India.
By March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were already under some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests an earlier case, from November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26th. Her hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Center on December 27th.
Initial genetic testing, on 27 December 2019, in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A statement to the public was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was informed on the same day.
When these reports came out, Wuhan doctors were warned by the police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war", to curb the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a sanitary cordon was announced on 23 January to halt travel to and from Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, reaching some 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations on January 25 have been cancelled in several localities.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to serve more patients.
Along with the newly built hospitals, China converted 14 other establishments in Wuhan into temporary hospitals, such as convention centers and stadiums.On January 26, the government launched more measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Travel restrictions were implemented in and out of Hubei.
Public transportation was modified, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Public movement controls have been implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) have been subjected to some form of exit restriction.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all international travelers arriving in the city. On March 23, mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in this case, through a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, except for Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. China's Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020, that the entry of individuals with visas or residence permits would be suspended from March 28, with no specific details on when this policy would be terminated.
Those wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, giving packages of financial incentives to businesses. The State Council declared a day of mourning beginning with a three-minute moment of silence nationwide on April 4 at 10 am, coinciding with the Qingming Festival. The central government, however, asked families to pay their respects online, observing physical distancing to prevent a new outbreak of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country's national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Jesus Church.
Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
On February 22, among the church's 9,336 followers, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported having symptoms.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea have been quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline schedule was also affected and modified. South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organized population screening program in the world for the virus. The country also isolated infected people and tracked and quarantined those who came into contact with them.
Screening methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms for those arriving from international travel via a mobile app, drive-thru virus testing, with results available the next day, and increased testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people a day to be tested.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak, although it has not put entire cities in quarantine.South Korean society was initially divided over the crisis response given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment on the grounds of government mismanagement of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in four weeks.
On 29 March it was announced that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad should be quarantined for two weeks.
Through media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for help with testing for the virus from 121 different countries.

Iran has five trillion riyals available to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that he had no plans for quarantined areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities before the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. Iran became the centre of the spread of the virus after China during February.
Amid allegations of cover-up of the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries tracked their Iran-related cases on February 28 indicating that the extent of the outbreak could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to that date.
The Iranian Parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members testing positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The body said there is a higher risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions such as detention centers, which also suffer from lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number since the outbreak began in the country.
At least 12 incumbent or retired politicians and government officials have died from the disease as of March 17.
As of 23 March, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there should be five times more cases in Iran than are being reported.
It is suggested that US sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be eased for the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group not associated with COVID-19 cases was subsequently detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the outbreak areas, people are forbidden to enter and leave.
Suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On 4 March, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities across the country when Italy hit 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, had to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least a month.

As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, with the majority of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an aging population in Italy and the inability to test everyone who had the virus by that time may have contributed to a high death rate.
The UK's response to the virus first emerged as one of the mildest of the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has been criticised for its acknowledged lack of diligence and intensity in its response to the problems faced by the population.[citation needed] On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising the suspension of all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting that people work from home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and gyms should be closed as soon as possible, and pledged to pay 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of £2,500 per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis.

WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays".
On 23 January, in reaction to the decision of the main authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that "that was certainly not a WHO recommendation" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated".[22] On 30 January, following confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was invoked because of the "risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and travel".
On February 5, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency to assist these countries that "have no systems in place to detect people who have contracted the virus, and even if it does emerge".

On 14 February, a WHO Joint Mission Team with China was empowered to provide international and WHO experts on the ground in China with assistance in domestic management and to assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through workshops and meetings with key national-level institutions and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and municipal levels, including urban and rural landscapes". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", stating that although it was too early to declare a pandemic, countries should still establish "a preparedness phase".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would be raised from "high" to "very high", the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the Emergency Health Program, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality to every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready", insisting that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan further stated that current data did not authorize public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus".
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was "deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction".[22] WHO faced much criticism for what was seen as inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.

The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro for the management of the pandemic, which started in China's Hubei province.
Provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been fired because of their approach to quarantine-related efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected early recognition of the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, favouring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus" saying that China's censorship "overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which was, in turn, condemned by some critics as racism and "a way to deflect the administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast got a detailed communication strategy from a United States government cabal with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with one strategy being quoted as "This is all about China.
We were advised to try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and television appearances". Channels such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have indicated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus is part of a propaganda for global influence.
The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a biased point of view and 'generosity policies'.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China also asked the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while allegedly sending aid to those same countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on April 3.

This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity.'
On March 22, after a phone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
The President of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "in offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good phase, they would also act reciprocally if necessary".
The planned NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be kept on a reduced scale.
Secretary-General for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it puts at risk the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate". The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of parliament infected, as well as fifteen current or former political figures.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted the United States to adopt social policies common to other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts anticipated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected as president in the 2020 election.
South Korea criticized Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at government-designated locations.
South Korean society was initially polarized over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment over what they called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising his response.The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency laws in response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections, and punish those deemed to have spread false news about the virus and the government's management of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of supply shortages, stemming from the increased use of global outbreak equipment, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The United States Food and Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and supplier disruptions.
Several locations also experienced the panic-driven shopping event which led to empty shelves of essential items such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including shortages of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has been warning of delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this would put workers' health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers, he said, to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food products, both areas were spared from an acute food shortage.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been successful, avoiding the acute food shortages that were predicted in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, with its significant agricultural production, has not seen a large reduction, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves have only been found temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials have released pork stocks to ensure adequate food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
Damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on March 16, the economy in China was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to shorten the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges about possible outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could surpass the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis indicated a 300 billion dollar impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years.

Many consider a likely economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including tourist spots, and government recommendations against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry was of an unprecedented level.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass crowds, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday to February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year celebrations.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a drop of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping center operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have occurred in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's 300 million migrant rural workers were left at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily wages) unemployed.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme.
The German programme for the remuneration of parttime workers has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organisations as well as people - both employed and self-employed - globally.
Arts and culture sector organisations have tried to maintain their (often publicly funded) mission of providing access to cultural heritage for the community, maintaining the safety of their staff and the public, and helping artists where possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at various levels, museums, bookstores, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms.Another recent and rapidly accelerating repercussion of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion events.
The film industry also experienced a breakdown, with the Vatican announcing that the Holy Week rites in Rome, which were to take place during the last week of the Christian Lent period, had been canceled.
Many dioceses have recommended that elderly Christians stay home rather than attend Sunday masses; some churches have made church services available via radio, live streaming online or television while others offer drive-in-style services.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies have also canceled services and limited public gatherings at churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as their residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most major events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered with plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled for a date after 2020, but not later than summer 2021".[21] Casinos and other gaming venues around the world were closed and in-person poker tournaments were also postponed or cancelled.
This led many players to gamble online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new sign-up rates.
Many big theaters like the Broadway ones also canceled all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work online as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming concerts or creating online "festivals" for artists to perform, share and publicize their work.
Online, various internet memes about the coronavirus are being spread as many seek humor and entertainment amidst uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism directed at people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people from the focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, distrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
February results (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserving the virus or being justly punished for what they provoked.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is targeted at those in the areas hit by the virus.
Following the advance of the outbreak in new focus countries, citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia.Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions pushing for a ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been added to Twitter's Trending Topics.
Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported increasing levels of racist slurs as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term considered by critics to be racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeast India, which borders China, and students in major cities in India have reportedly suffered persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The state unit chairman of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, claimed that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "that is why God has turned against them".
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, who called it "misguided". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents was ignited by the pandemic, with foreigners being branded "foreign garbage" and targets of "disposal".
Many paid-access newspapers have removed them from some or all coverage of the coronavirus.
Several scientific publishers have made scientific articles related to the outbreak available in open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings as soon as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and designed only to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It's used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) may be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or who remained asymptomatic.
An accurate disease mortality rate and herd immunity level in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the amount of testing carried out in countries.
This variability is likely to still substantially affect the mortality rates of the cases recorded, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test may be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or saliva sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing with a swab of the pharynx is reliable only in the first week of disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
For infected persons tested in the second week, as an alternative, material from the samples may be removed from the airway bed by suction catheter or material expelled by expectoration (secretion) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It searches for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronavirus, and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the China National Medical Products Administration for its PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel for Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories by Reagent Resource International.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits generated inconclusive tests for faulty reagents and a test bottleneck at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout the month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only then were local and state laboratories allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of RT-PCR-based testing for COVID-19.
Quest Diagnostics also made testing for COVID-19 nationally available from March 9, 2020.
No quantity restriction has been announced; collection and processing of samples should be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service.[citation needed] On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.[citation needed] On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.[citation needed]
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a US FDA approval for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can produce positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S., and Abbott hopes to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and binds it specifically to the nucleocapsid protein (protein N) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "chest X-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT findings may be present even before symptoms emerge".
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobar opacities in opaque glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetrical distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its imaging aspects coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".[5] As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals who started 7 days or shortly after symptoms, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection step is not required before testing. On March 26, 2020, the FDA designated 29 entities that notified the agency as required, and are now eligible to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA with an emergency use authorization.[citation needed] In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
Antibodies are normally detected 14 days after the onset of infection. e UK considered in early April that none of the antibody test kits purchased were suitable enough to be used.
Hong Kong has set up a system where suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient", they must expel saliva into the tube, send it back and get a result shortly after. The British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they go to hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if any is used. In drive-thru testing for COVID-19 in suspected cases, a health professional collects samples taking appropriate precautions.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea conduct some of the fastest and most comprehensive testing in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, with 10,700 being tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since week 12 of 2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to week 12 of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, collecting the samples and performing additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, a makeshift 2,000 m2 laboratory for emergency detection called "H-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the modeling revealed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost of dealing with quarantine would have doubled if this testing capability had not had online access.
The Wuhan lab was quickly followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily yield was 50,000 tests per day.[citation needed] Open source multiplexed models released by Origami Assays were released as capable of testing up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19, using only 93 trials.[citation needed] These balanced models can be run in small labs without the need for robotic manipulators for liquids.[citation needed]
In March, shortages or insufficient quantities of reagent became an obstacle to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free up RNA genomes for further testing.[citation needed] On 31 March, it was reported that the UAE is now doing more per capita testing in its population for coronavirus than other countries, and would be on track to increase the level of testing and reach most of the population.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capability, and the acquisition of a lab for mass population-scale processing from Group 42 and BGI (inspired by their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection labs in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to operate outside China.
Different testing methods targeting different components of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany's method for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that have no resources to develop their own.
The German method was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, there was a delay in testing made available to the US and China and the US faced problems with the reliability of test kits at the very beginning of the outbreak, and these countries along with Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet demand and recommendations for testing by health professionals.
In contrast, experts say South Korea's wide availability for testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Testing capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization indicated that strengthening testing programs is the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests in private US laboratories to be delayed, and the supply of cotton swabs and chemical reagents has been affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC showed "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results could be the consequence of a failure in sampling or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Minister of Spain stated that it would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China generated incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that were considered to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be disposed of in the Danube.[citation needed] Ates Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health said that Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that he would not "use them".[citation needed] The UK acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced that they were not useful.
Testing, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and monitoring of those with whom people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two stages of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases discovered were quarantined.
With movement to the commune restricted, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much more slowly than in other developed countries, and without drastic restrictions such as mandatory closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to seriously advise residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened as planned after the March 23 holiday.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, country travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
One statistical study identified that countries that did more testing, relative to the number of deaths, had lower mortality rates, probably because those countries are better able to detect those with no or few symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that lack testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column 'Positive in % of tests' is influenced by the testing policy of the countries.
A country that tests only people in hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all its citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Hand washing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the oropharynx.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as the flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five crucial times during the day when washing hands with soap is important include: before and after defecating, after cleaning a child's butt or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals, and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash.
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, animal feed or animal waste.
Clinical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main purpose of handwashing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections.
And lowering the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study found that better hand-washing practices can lead to small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, child mortality rates related to diarrheal and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to areas in need.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes may be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs), as a routine behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the leading AID, is the leading cause of death among children under five, claiming the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, making hand-washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet a long-standing habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually associated with other sanitary interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dryness of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a peeling and irritating skin condition known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five crucial times during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the toilet (urination, defecation), after cleaning a child's butt (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating, and before/after preparing a food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other situations where proper hand-washing technique should be practiced to prevent the transmission of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of hand washing with soap.
A 2015 handwashing study in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households had the habit of washing their hands with soap.[citation needed] A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 percent; the United States near the average at 77 percent; and China had the lowest rate at 23 percent.[citation needed] Several methods for behavior change currently exist to increase acceptance of handwashing at critical times.[citation needed] Mass handwashing for children in schools at certain times of the day is an alternative in developing countries to inculcate handwashing in children's habits.[citation needed]
The "Essential Health Services Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, supplemented by daily hand washing with soap, daily fluoride brushing, are at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleansing agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, components of organic dirt, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
Bar soap, due to its reusable nature, can retain bacteria accumulated from previous uses.
A small number of studies that have examined bacterial transmission from a contaminated soap bar have concluded that transmission is unlikely since the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
The CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic dosing controls is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been widely publicized to the health-conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants could lead to the selection of organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are advertised.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protective agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid, and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).[citation needed] A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps are as effective at preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands as antibacterial soaps aimed at the end consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, hot soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing the natural oily matter that holds dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using hot water is not effective in reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic water-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizer, antiseptic hand sanitizer, or hand sanitizer) are beginning to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a moisturizer, such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity, and hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol effectively kill germs.
Alcohol-based sanitizers kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (MRSA and ERV), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost totally ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) virus, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.Hand antiseptics or alcohol-based hand sanitizers may be used to wet or cover both hands well.
The back and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their extremities are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand sanitizers, especially when the hands are visually dirty.
The growing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and quick extermination action against micro-organisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers may cause skin dryness unless skin emollients and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of the alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by the addition of glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Contact allergic dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives in alcohol-based hand sanitizers rarely occur.
The lower tendency to cause irritant contact dermatitis became an attractive one when compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water-based agents do not clean your hands of organic matter, only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is highly dependent on substances and formulation, and has historically fallen far short of alcohol and alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to have reduced efficacy after repeated use, probably due to increasing adverse reactions on the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford a soap and instead use ashes or dirt.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than pure water, but it may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms the spread of disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, since it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
The WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand-washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with cold or hot running water.
It is recommended running water as fixed washbasins may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not seem to be relevant.
Rubbing your hands with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap instead of plain water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer removes more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Washing in a sink can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let dry in the open air.
Wet or damp hands are more likely to re-contaminate, and the areas most commonly overlooked are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Split nail polish and artificial nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin lesions that increase the risk of infection transmission.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where running water and/or soap are not available, for example, pouring water from a gallon or kettle with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations with restricted water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "improvised taps" and other low-cost options.
An improvised faucet is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water into the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective way to dry in public toilets.
A growing volume of research suggests that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the towel paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels presented by towel paper, heated air hand dryers and the latest air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to be, on average, 194 percent higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254 percent higher in the rest of the palm.
Air-jet drying caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, of 42% in the palm area near the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with towel paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm.
The air jet dryer, which projects air out of the unit at rated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to expel microorganisms from the hands and the unit potentially contaminating other bathroom users and the environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spreads micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
Towel papers did not show significant dissemination of microorganisms.In a 2005 study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Handwashing with wet hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative to the lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers shall contain at least 60% alcohol.
Clinical hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with its use.
Clinical hand washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to soap and rub all parts of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the entanglement of the fingers.
If there is debris under the nails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing remains unacceptable in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a bulletin demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and friction in healthcare sectors.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines of the organisation can also be found on this website for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstrated regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body fluids/blood
before an ascetic task, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (medicinal or antimicrobial soaps) gives an exterminating effect to a hand washing agent.
Such extermination may be desirable before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are predominant.To "clean" the hands for surgery requires a tap that can be opened and closed without touching the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine antiseptics, sterilized towels to dry the hands after washing, and a sterilized cleaning brush and other sterilized tools for cleaning under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing of the hands and forearms to the elbows, usually for 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When washing, water from the forearms should not flow into the hands.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are wiped with a sterile towel and the surgical robe is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after treating a sick person.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit from hand cleaning in the first 20% of washing, and a slight additional benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.
Washing with plain soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand sanitizing with an alcohol-based solution to washing hands with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each revealed that the alcohol-based hand sanitizer reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in reducing influenza A virus, H1N1, and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands.[citation needed] Interventions to increase hand hygiene in hospital settings may involve staff awareness of hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and verbal and written warnings to staff.
More research is needed on which interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an essential, economically viable tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable sources of water, soap or handwashing resources in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal handwashing.
For example, in most of rural Africa, handwashing faucets near any public or private toilets are rare, although there are cheap options for building handwashing stations.
However, low hand-washing rates may instead be the result of ingrained habits rather than the absence of soap and water.
Encouraging and advocating handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of handwashing and provoke a long-term behavioural change in the population.
Monitoring and evaluation are necessary for this to work effectively.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.An example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Three-Star Approach" which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the maximum three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of handwashing promotional campaigns aimed at reducing childhood disease and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness campaign that tries to achieve a change in habits.As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF announced the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall cost/benefit relationship of hand washing in developing countries in relation to DALY classification.
However, one analysis suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health  especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals  was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two forerunners of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
Back then, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-care-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have sparked increased awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, signs with "techniques for proper hand washing" have been hung near hand washing sinks in public toilets and in office building and airport toilets in Germany.
The expression "wash your hands" means declaring a reluctance to take responsibility or to be conniving with something.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase of more general use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience in relation to the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It was also found that people, after remembering or witnessing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and tend to place more importance on handwashing equipment.
Furthermore, those who can wash their hands after such a view are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of "cleaning", such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water but not soap, to wash hands is part of a characteristic ritual hand washing in many religions, including the Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washbasin in Christianity, and ablution in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam allow hand washing after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam allow hand washing before and after meals.
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational health and safety methodologies to hazard controls for the prevention of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace hazard controls depend on the workplace and the workplace itself, based on risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.
According to the Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA), jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, maintaining a respiratory label, and a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium-risk functions include those that require frequent or direct contact with people who are not known to be infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or travel abroad.
This includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-density workplaces, and in the high-volume retail market.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with the use of high-efficiency air filters, protective coverings, and the provision of personal protective equipment in the event that a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that healthcare and mortuary workers who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures on people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 aerosol generation and collect or handle specimens of these people.
Suitable hazard controls for such workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment appropriate to the work being performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have a number of effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they become ill, because they have to care for others, or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of which products are in demand and the means of acquiring those products (such as shopping outside peak hours or through delivery or drive-thru services).
Finally, the dispatch of items from areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be halted. An infectious disease preparedness and action plan may be used to guide protective actions.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising at home and in the community, and individual worker risk factors such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls needed to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Infectious disease action and preparedness plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting those at highest risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimising adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a widely used structure in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behaviour and may be the most cost-effective implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes to work policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of hazard to the worker, adjusted appropriately as needed (e.g. respirators), used appropriately and continuously, inspected regularly, stored and replaced as needed, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of appropriately to prevent contamination.
According to the United States Department of Health and Safety (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick and wearing a breathing label, including covering sneezing and coughing, preparing containers for napkins and common waste, preparing for teleworking or staggered shifts if necessary, discouraging the use of tools and equipment by other workers, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a key step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they have no fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or alleviate other symptoms, and also recommends that sick leave policies be flexible, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that they be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium-risk jobs include those that require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known to be confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to current community transmission in the company's location, or because the individual has a recent history of traveling abroad in a country with high COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-density workplaces, and some high-volume retail stores. Engineering controls for this group and for high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic bulkheads, and installing a drive-thru window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk groups include encouraging workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, establishing staggered shifts, canceling non-essential meetings with COVID-19 epidemics, developing communication plans, including a forum to respond to workers' needs, providing training on the use of hand-held protective equipment, providing workers with access to the workplace, providing training and other tools that are necessary to protect workers from COVID-19, and providing the public with access to and information about the use of hand-held protective equipment, providing training and other tools that are necessary to protect workers from exposure to COVID-19 and preventing exposure to the environment.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include isolating the sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, with a crew member assigned to serve the sick person and provide a face mask, or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
Crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick patient has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazardous waste bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include delaying the journey by the sick passenger, self-isolation and immediate reporting to the on-board medical centre if anyone develops a fever or other symptoms during the journey.
For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has been present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or choral classes, or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between tables, more stringent arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors, and the use of a separate health care location for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, prolonged school absences may be considered.For law enforcement officials who perform daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who come into contact with individuals suspected of COVID-19 or with confirmed illness follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers should clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before reuse using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow standard operating procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE and for containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and morgue workers to be in high or very high risk exposure categories.
High-risk roles include workers in drug delivery, health care, laboratory and medical transportation who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol-generation procedures on confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, or collect or handle specimens of such patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive specimen collection.
High-exposure morgue jobs include workers involved with preparing the bodies of people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at the time of their death; the risk of exposure becomes very high if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, including when aerosol generating procedures are performed.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some mortuary and healthcare scenarios.
Specimens shall be handled with biosecurity level 3 caution.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients admitted to hospital be separated into two separate waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case for COVID-19. In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals working within 6 feet of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for professionals performing aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 particulate filter facial respirators or higher quality respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adjustment testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of suits, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
WHO recommends only a surgical mask for screening personnel at the point of entry.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective eyewear or face shield, surgical apron and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct patient care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE needed for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing it while treating multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

We are in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and community building, which are the foundations of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we've seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is a remarkable validation of the incredible human beings we've had the privilege to work with.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have all of you as my coworkers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
This person reminded me how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol it is that this essential resource remains online and available to everyone.
Your work makes that possible, because you keep the workplaces running, pay our coworkers and keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
At that meeting, we discussed what we thought was an appropriate course of action for what we are experiencing and how best to keep the organization sustainable during this period.
We want to reduce stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to take a little time off, that's fine.
For all officials, service providers and contract workers:
Our expectation of working will be four hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until otherwise ordered.
We're not declaring a holiday, so if you can work during normal hours, you could be useful to our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and whether you need to care for loved ones, shop for groceries, or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, you don't have to work.
That rule would not even need to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
No certificate or paid leave is required, just ask your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are being met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of the training and certification sector so that his sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate management attention.)
Staff working by the hour will receive full pay.
We've said this before, and we're committing to honoring our commitment to our contractors and hourly employees.
Everyone will receive their wages based on their normal work record under normal circumstances.
Wages are independent of whether you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll give you our full support.
Many people view work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Reminding them that their well-being is more important.
We just ask that you let your manager know, so we know what to expect and we can help with the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities we should continue to perform.
The Sites Reliability Engineering, HR, Reliability and Security and Fundraising teams (among others) carry out key activities that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and shift our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is much to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt us in the future.
We have no intention of "working double time to make up for lost time" after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for the budget, and for employees to prioritize essential work, personal care and caring for loved ones, while accommodating those who need or want to work on a reduced commute in the coming weeks.
The extension of the schedule greatly reduces the current planning workloads and pressure on the entire organization.
We'll present our proposal to the board next week and update the representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the annual planning team for their leadership in this process.
Status, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our coworkers in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, as a precaution, we have employed an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and all the elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is employing its own due diligence protocol using products that are safe for its patrons.
We're relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all Washington employees.
Last week, our Washington office moved to a fully remote configuration, in keeping with the shared guide with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we're also discussing the rental of an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time colleagues who work remotely know it can be a fit, and they'd like to offer some advice:
Limit the length of meetings to no more than one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them into several days.
Set the meeting, have a schedule, and send in advance reading materials.
Use video as your default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make it easier to collaborate and connect in real time.
Have a leader to facilitate the meetings, someone to monitor the chat questions and the list of participants, and someone to help take notes (or collaborative notes).
Email tech support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to assist in the increase of remote work at the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community aid to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editing marathons, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We warned them that we understood that our cancellation request and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete their agreed grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying their goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the global community seems to be one of sadness at the shutdown, but also of relief at the clarity and ability to keep focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia and in other situations.
The media resources team is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to them.
Keeping up to date on COVID-19 related issues
We'll send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with the staff.
We'll use that time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together, and we'll help with whatever it takes.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information in this email and all other COVID-19 related information on the company's wiki.
The communication resources team will update these pages and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff who live in countries currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or about the coverage challenge, or anything else you might need help with, feel free to notify it and work with the communications resources team.
We're here to help provide support and collaboration as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, email Bryan Judan, Global Operations Director of HR.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that at this time our work and obligations will probably need to adapt in a way that we have not adapted in the past.
These are the steps we believe are necessary as support at this time, so that we can continue to work, providing our movement with the support it needs and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months, ahead.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need you all to take care of yourselves and your families so that you're in the best shape when you need it.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!

Angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme coupled to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug targeted for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelium and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal amino acid and colectrin transporter domain in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single-pass type 1 membrane protein with its enzyme-active domain exposed on the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cell membrane of major type II lung alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ECA2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of the ECA2 is to act as a counterweight to the ECA.
ACE clears the type I angiotensin hormone into type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn cleaves the carboxymino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also cleaves several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradicinine, apilin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 functions as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike protein S1 to the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into endosomes located inside cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the serine-protease host TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to hypothesize that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help in fighting infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing the inhibitor pattern of ACE and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analyses published on 11 July 2012 found that "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
In addition, ' the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at high risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia".
Human recombinant ECA2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications to assist monitoring in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Various frameworks for creating contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues were raised, particularly with regard to systems based on tracking the geographical location of application users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with a person with COVID-19.
It's in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be ceded to the government.North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking app was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for distribution in weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are planning apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia is planning to implement a geo-delimitation app for diagnosed COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if the acceptance of the application is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of fake or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple is setting limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them to "official" or otherwise respected organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The organisations declared eight conditions for government projects:
the surveillance should be 'legal, necessary and proportionate';
Extensions of monitoring and surveillance should have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid the aggravation of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for by law;
safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse should be in place;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) in Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from its device operating systems when it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy problems.
However, not all central server systems need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created to use central servers for intercommunication only (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracing.
Instead of using a single application, the system gathered tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate text message alerts for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information publicly available, which is permitted due to sweeping changes to information confidentiality laws following the country's MERS outbreak.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites.
As of 6 April 2020, details had not yet been disclosed.
Privacy-preserving contact tracking is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific literature dating back to at least 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-respecting solutions, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other mobile devices.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that covers centralised and decentralised approaches, and is not a single protocol.Decentralised protocols include Decentralized privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for using privacy preservation techniques during the collection and use of location or cross-roads data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication "Apps Play Dirty: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a privacy technology developer and originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and controllers without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that came together around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global interoperability of alerting and tracking applications, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BlueTrace protocol used by the official government application has become open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed to preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be implemented in three stages:
developing tools to enable the government to create official coronavirus tracking apps while preserving privacy
Google and Apple plan to address the persistent and assumed surveillance issues by first distributing the system through running system updates, and later removing it in the same way once the threat is over.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug reproposal, re-filing, re-assignment, or therapeutic replacement) is the reproposal of a drug approved for the treatment of a medical condition or disease different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the lines of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug-eluting proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analysing these link points provides the reasonable design for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphatease.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds which they then refined and analyzed for their structural similarities to the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical trial design.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs being studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in New York state would begin on March 24.[citation needed] On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an Emergency Use Authorization (AUE).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised through the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when "there's no other option".
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within an average of four days, while the duration of illness in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 pneumonia patients, half were treated with favipiravir, and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the evidence to support the medicine is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to stockpile it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals where it would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has been opening up to the Trump administration about purchasing the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease, when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about redirecting resources to repurposing drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir exhibited in vitro antiviral activity against phylum, pneumonia, paramyx and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the resistance developed by mutations, which can lead to transmission or more serious diseases.
There are several clinical trials underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more severe disease.
There are three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials taking place for hospitalized and seriously ill people with COVID-19: two of them are placebo-controlled (in China and Canada), while the other has no control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) in Japan is planning a clinical trial of Teijin's Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
A phase II study with a type of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from the severe hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
At the moment, researchers at the Heart Institute in Canada are investigating the role of colchicine in reducing lung complications and inflammation in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women, breast-feeding women or women not using effective contraceptive methods were not included in the trials.
Several blood thinners are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used in the treatment of patients, leading the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study involving 300 patients is looking at the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and therapeutic dosages.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, there has been considerable attention in the scientific community to give new purpose to antiviral drugs approved and developed for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as being able to receive a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19 patients:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6) receptor: approved in China.
There are also trials in Italy and China.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with completed clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop it.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A large outbreak spread in 2020, which led to considerable investment and research activities for developing a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Coalition (CEPI) initiative stated in April that the needs for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 diverse technology platforms being researched and developed during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The targets of the largest platforms that have advanced to the Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (stage I developer and candidate for vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and candidate for vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute).[14] Another 37 have been announced but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being designed).[15]
A phase I-II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing. It is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and multicenter, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing disease while also monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (still in preclinical research).
On 24 January 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential for a vaccine with a molecular staple, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On 24 January 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, with the goal of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine with similar technology to that used for neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were beginning trials.

in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for preclinical trial and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 isolates and even at an accelerated pace, it would take at least between one and a half and two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a Coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in research in the lab, with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian stated that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac "large sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" under protest from the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162, an mRNA-based vaccine candidate, currently in preclinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have preclinical trial results in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could depart for human trials in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to $29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receipt of the sequencing from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 COVID-19 medical countermeasure research projects, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
During almost the same period, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if further outbreaks of Coronavirus occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines that elicited potent antibody-specific responses to antigens [in the mouse] that were evident to have started 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a possible nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be engineered to replicate within a human bacterium to produce harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities joined forces to access IBM supercomputers, in combination with cloud computing from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
A subsequent randomized trial in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines in development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate vaccine efficacy using animal specimens specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE2-mouse, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, indicates a need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures to handle live virus, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in non-human animals.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS became prevalent, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there has been one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that has completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are virus-vectored vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media posts point to existing patents for gene sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Betacoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The exposure time to onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but may vary from 2 to 14 days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured, and the virus is spread among people primarily through direct contact, usually through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
Although these droplets are produced by exhaling, they usually fall to the ground or stay on surfaces rather than remain infectious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first 3 days after onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
Wearing masks is recommended for people suspected of having the virus and for people responsible for their care.
Recommendations for mask use by the general population vary, with some authorities recommending non-use, some recommending use, and others mandating use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries by all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty staying awake, and bluish face or lips.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only tightness of the chest and palpitations.
In some, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is normally six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic agents in transmission is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Spit and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking out loud releases more droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering your mouth can cause droplets to reach 15 feet (4.5 m).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside people's rooms contained positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolised and therefore airborne.
Although there is concern that it could be transmitted through feces, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, normally one person infects one or two.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
This, however, depends on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly, and soap products degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, deactivating it and removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load, while the sixth patient had the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with household soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a spike (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage was observed in 12% of infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe illness.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in patients in the ITU with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis.[citation needed] Necropsies of people who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for ACE2-expressing respiratory tract epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic T cells secreting GM-CSF have been shown to correlate with IL-6 secreting inflammatory monocytes recruitment and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported in the autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard testing method is polymerase chain reaction via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal swab, however a nasal swab or catarrh sample may be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) were in development but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experiment with testing has shown that its accuracy is 60 to 70 percent.
The US FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in bilateral multilobar opaque glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common at the onset of infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (thick lobular septum with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
The following conditions are observed:
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of giant multinucleated cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukocyte-erythroblast reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when you cough or sneeze, as well as covering your mouth with the inside of your elbow if a handkerchief is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals.[citation needed] Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart from each other.
No effective drug is known for COVID-19 prevention. Since the vaccine is not expected to be released before 2021, a key point for COVID-19 control is to try to slow the peak of the epidemic, also known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
It also recommends using alcohol-based hand antiseptic with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.For places where commercial hand antiseptics are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity is via ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand asepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be helpful for those with mild symptoms and in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
US intensive care physicians and pulmonologists have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some healthcare professionals recommend acetaminophen instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risks of virus transmission, especially in the healthcare environment, when procedures that can generate aerosols are being carried out, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in airborne infection isolation (AII) rooms in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions.
The recommended equipment is: an EPI blanket, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorized the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for uses not described.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive airway pressure in two levels.
Whether either of these leads to the same benefits for people who are seriously ill is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to stick with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles, compared to high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, limiting the health system's ability to deal with the sudden escalation in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
One study in China noted that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans with a high level of PEEP and a pressure control mode are needed to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung and pneumothoracic injury associated with ventilation.
High PEEP may not be available in older fans.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials are underway with several antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to be developed, several of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medication can be tested on people with a variety of diseases.
The WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in the testing of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has given temporary authorization for the use of plasma from convalescing people as a treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies necessary to show its safety and efficacy against the disease have not yet been conducted.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are requested to provide their name and ID number.
The app can detect "close contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends quarantine but also alerts local health authorities.Big data analysis of cell phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and people they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the government of Israel authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who are suspected of being infected with coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect people who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Back in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect whoever is violating quarantine.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was told by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are still on the road".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The rise of social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress, and an economic crisis is a perfect storm to damage people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may be mild, with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, as data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, are available, but data from COVID-19 are lacking. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to adult distress respiratory syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically increased prothrombin time, were described in 6% of COVID-19 hospital inmates, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who have COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the median time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung scan looked like acute respiratory distress syndrome.
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was detected due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had pre-existing comorbidities.
Estimates of comorbidity mortality vary due to these regional differences but also due to methodological difficulties.
Underreporting of mild cases may lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die, compared to nonsmokers.
The Hong Kong hospital authority has seen a 20 to 30 percent drop in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests have indicated organ damage.
This can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and long-lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported where recovery from COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are thought to be the worst of a prolonged infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, through overflow infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection has become almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency CID-10 disease codes U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 deaths without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the case-fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection-fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small town of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing a relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally recorded as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as seen in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had confirmed death from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in the 50s, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between the sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immune differences by sex, lower prevalence of female smokers, and the development by men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were men.
As of April 2020, the US government was not tracking data on sex-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020, that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus explained that "CO" is for "corona", "VI" is for "virus", "D" is for disease and "19" is for when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatisation.
WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and " 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease" as interim names for the virus and disease, in line with the 2015 guidance against using placeholders in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare materials such as nasopharyngeal swabs and respirator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital was in urgent need of a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it on time, a local startup reverse engineered and printed the 100 valves needed overnight.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged, which quickly spread across the Internet.
Apparently, humans are capable of transmitting the virus to some other animals.
The study could not find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is ongoing in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization started the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with the most likely efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, the researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the whole virus.
The use of this virus, whether it is inactive or dead, is aimed at provoking a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.
There are over 300 clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Anti-viral drug redirection makes up the bulk of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries due to a report in late April.
A dynamic review of clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was underway in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There has been an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for further study in vivo after demonstrating low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that the initial spike protein in preparation by serine transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine-like anti-seizure properties.
A non-randomized phase 2 trial at national level is underway in Italy, after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to counteract these developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of steroid-induced refractory cytokine release syndrome by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for SRC.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy may mediate a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of strongly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after becoming aware of the spread of the virus.
