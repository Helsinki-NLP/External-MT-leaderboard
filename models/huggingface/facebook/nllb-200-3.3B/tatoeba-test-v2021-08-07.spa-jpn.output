I hit a tree.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
️ Are you going to cut down all the trees in here?
This tree bears no fruit.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
With these trees, you can't see the landscape.

What's your book?
aaaaaaaaaa
Thank you for the book.
️️️️️️️️️
️ Do you have any idea how much I've read?
         
I'll give you this book.
Do you have any books on Armenia?
A book fell from the shelf.
"Kitab itu di mana?""Di atas meja".
Put the book on the top shelf.
Please remove your book from this table.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
How many books have you read?
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Put the book back where you found it.
      
I bought this book for 300 yen.

You'll find that book in the history section of the library.
          
I love this book.

No, that's not true.
It's not a real apartment.
It can't be true.
Maybe that's true.
     
A true friend wouldn't say a thing like that.
Paul kissed Lily on the lips?
I love my grandma very much.
️️️️️️️️
  
I think that rumor is true.

If you're not in a hurry, would you be so kind as to help me out a moment?

Is my dad really Santa Claus?
Only truly dedicated girls can stand this job.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️
That's a really great idea.
Tell the truth, please.
️ What do you really mean?
I'm not your father.
Give him back this book.
Sara's got thirty-one feathers.
- You can take the book.
️ I'll bring the book back tomorrow.
Who wrote this book?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Put the book back on the shelf.

Unfortunately, that's true.

I've changed my mind.
Tom is losing consciousness.
Tom said he understands how you feel.
- Oh, well, that's too bad.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Don't worry, I'll take care of them for you.
Tom's got a gun!

I was going to go with her, but I was too busy.
I sat next to her.

I guessed she'd be 40.
I made her angry.
I got a letter from her.
I noticed his hands were trembling.
I've seen all his movies.

I advised him to take the morning train.
I'll wait here till he comes.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I've hurt her feelings on purpose.
I understand what she says to me.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
I tried not to look her in the eye.
I know those girls.
I know her well.
I'm sure she'll join us.
I don't like the way you mock her.
I want to go skiing with her.
- We listened to her for a while.
I can't forgive her.
I valued her very much.
I waited till she spoke.
We picked out a nice birthday present for him.
I saw her cross the street.
aaaaaaaa
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I don't like him either.
I not only read his novels, but his poems as well.
️️️️️️️️
        
I consulted him about his new book.

I owe you a debt.
️His son we call Jimmy.
I didn't like his opinion at all.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I cuffed him.
I accepted his invitation.
I'll hire whoever he recommends.
I went to church with him.
I waited awake till ten o'clock.
I have a letter written by him.
I learned a lot from your books.
I thought he'd come.
️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️
I lent him a CD.
I discovered it when I was stealing pears in the orchard.
I think he's honest.
- Did I hurt your feelings?
I can't help feeling sorry for him.
I interpreted his silence as consent.
Unfortunately I didn't get to his speech in time.
100$. - 100$. - 100$. - 100$. - 100$.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
    
I can't make him do my will.

He laughed at me.
️️️️
I was his tennis partner.
I'm shorter than him.
I treated him like my own son.
       
I couldn't understand what he was saying.
- I don't care what he says.
I've never exchanged a word with him.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I couldn't talk to him.
i am not as tall as him.
   
️️️️️️️️
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
I can't get in touch with him.
I paid him the money.
I don't have as much money as he does.
I convinced him that he was wrong.
ąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąą
I saw him go up to the second floor.
I asked him where I could park the car.
I wanna wait for Tom.
         
I acted in accordance with the rules.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I need a massage.
Tatoeba doesn't have all the languages I need.

       
I forgot it.
Don't forget about us!
I think so too.
️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️
    
I'm not in such a hurry.
I had a quick lunch.
I'm ashamed of my son's laziness.
I held my breath and waited.
       
  
John has spoken to me in a rude way.
aaaaaaaaaaaaa
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
ąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąąą
I agree with your opinion.
- Do you like me?
I may have hurt your feelings, but that wasn't my intention.
ᴏᴏ ᴏᴏᴏᴏᴏᴏᴏᴏᴏᴏᴏ
I'm grateful.
I can't thank you enough.
Don't hate me. Don't hate me.

When I came back, the car was gone.
I showed my ticket at the door.
Do you want me to help you?
You want me to help?
Do you need our help?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I asked him to reply as soon as he received my letter.
️️️️️️️️️️
   
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

️️️️️️️
I've got two cameras.
I've got the tape.
I have a pen.
Bring me my glasses.
I'll bring you lunch.
This is the only camera I have.
Bring it to me.
I was looking for you.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I found the key I was looking for.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
200 bua aaaaa
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
After school I don't study.
- I'm a teacher. - Mm.
I prefer English to math.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Is my sentence correct?

I haven't shown you my new Mustang?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I want to buy a new camera.
I can't afford to buy a new car.
