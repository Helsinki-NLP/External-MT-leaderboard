While there appears to be one experimental vaccine that could reduce Ebola deaths, so far, no drugs have been found that are suitable for treating existing infections.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, was initially promising in this area, but official studies indicated that the benefit of this cocktail was less than the benefits sought in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as the control standard, meaning that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the message of the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the U.S. Olympic Committee that the interests of athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by advancing meaningful change within our organization, rather than by withdrawing licenses.
The United States Gymnastics Association is supporting an independent investigation that could highlight that the Larry Nassar survivors' courageously descriptions of relative abuse could have gone undiscovered for a long time without embracing any necessary and appropriate changes.
The USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee have the same goal - to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to achieve their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowered environment.

Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a common theory already, but it also provides details that fossils generally fail to provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The discovery also gives a deep insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a fully developed bony series, called the "backbone", but possess other features of the feathers - such as protrusions and miniature protrusions - researchers concluded that the backbone was likely a later evolutionary outgrowth of these other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or for display. The researchers suggest that although this tail belongs to a small dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not a tail like a chick.
The researchers noted that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult bird feathers rather than a kitten's feathers.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.
The governor's office said 19 of the injured were police officers.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: it is found that the activity of all the stars in the system is governed by their radiance and rotation alone.
The photons and rotations together determine the star's specific Rosebud number, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the lower the star's activity relative to the magnetic fluctuations.

The 802.11n wireless standard operates at 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz.
The ability to operate on two frequencies allows the standard to be compatible with its predecessors, specifically 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided that the base station is equipped with dual radio sets.
802.11n speeds are much faster than its predecessors with a maximum theoretical output of 600 megabits per second.
Duval, married with two adult sons, made little impression on Miller, who was the center of the story.

The work done is mostly theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations made of the Arrow galaxy.
The effect the team investigated is due to the interstellar forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon attracts the earth and causes tides, the Milky Way attracts the Milky Way.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that natural matter does.
It explains that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a halo-like state, and it's small particles in large numbers.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the drug-resistant tuberculosis or what is known as XDR-TB in the KwaZuluNatal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new mutant bacterial form is "very disturbing and very frightening because of the very high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll believes that some patients, including two hospital staff, may have contracted the virus inside the hospital.
Within a year, an infected person may contract 10 to 15 of the closest congeners.
However, the percentage of drug-resistant TB in the total TB population remains low; 6,000 of the 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Their thermal behavior is not as constant as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Northern Arizona, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experiment: voters lock themselves in a polling booth, and put a pre-printed paper ballot indicating their preferred candidate in a wrapper.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box, and signs it on the voters' list.
The French electoral law regulates the procedure with unfavourable rigor.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can be sure that there are no envelopes at the start of voting, and that only envelopes of registered and duly authorized voters and commissioners are added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under intensive supervision following a specific procedure.

Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We arrested five men who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanjar, Rambru Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Director Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
But the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred has been temporarily closed while emergency services has released the driver of a red Audi TT.
He had initially been admitted to the James Baggett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been on trial in Edinburgh's Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
She's being held pending indictment and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness could be questionable because her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered that the publication of the images is potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "it seems to me that journalists are certainly going in a dangerous direction if they publish photos or similar of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that there will be no further comment until at least after the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 borders in the Middle East.
Other topics reported to have been covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is considered an important issue for both peoples, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in Ghor for 10 years, once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a continuous presence for only five years.
The guards had to closely supervise the shooters in the complementary pest control experiment, as the experiment was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia, eligible volunteers were selected under the Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of NPWS's Parks and Heritage Conservation, the four hunters selected for the first hunt have received comprehensive safety guidance and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday by a newly elected nine-member provisional council.
It's the fifth Martelli by-election in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the provisional electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was in the process of responding to Martelli's widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, have erupted over the failure to hold elections scheduled for 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of hacking, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded to Apple's call for a delay to the report as "really unfortunate".
The quake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday 9:19 p.m. GMT).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office has stated that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there are no indications of a potential tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took two Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages were released early, including children and elderly people, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographer later took the place of an elderly lady because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Leggins followed in his father's footsteps and took medicine as his profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and then started work at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Leggins began investigating premature births during his spare time, while working at the hospital.
He showed through his research that when given one of the hormones it would accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders or what is known as the "black box" on Wednesday.
As fellow wrestlers praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Lona was the first radical queen, my first manager, Luna, died on the night of the moon, a strong, unique woman".
Dustin Goldst was quoted as saying, "Lona was as eccentric as I am... and perhaps more so than I am... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Among 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the percentage opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed agree with this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
In terms of the two opposing sides of the poll, 29% of those polled thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never be a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist's fitness was questioned because of his condition. He was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He couldn't take the pain medication because it's not allowed in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people were working on the discovery using different hardware and software as February began, and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comets may have been a source of delivering water to Earth along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the Earth formed after comets collided with it long ago.
Comeau, 53, began his reign earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense".
He's likely to run for president in 2016.
Nioxigen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-linked technology as opposed to the old technology that used ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint the location of an aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more specific information.
There is no additional transport, no overhead trains stop at Wembley, and no car parks, parking facilities and ground rides.
Concerns about lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the match will be held behind closed doors, without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the evolution of new species took only two generations - though it was thought to take much longer - because of breeding between the endemic Darwin's sparrow, the medium-sized ground sparrow, the migratory cactus sparrow, and the sharp-nosed ground sparrow.
Gold can be shaped into many forms. It can be wrapped into small forms.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be rolled up and unrolled. It can be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin, and it could be glued onto another metal, and it could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "Luminary Manuscripts".
It's called the chemical's pH number, and you can make an index of this number using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The level of hydrogen peroxide is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are electron-deprived protons (where hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Turn the dry powders together and then grind them with clean, wet hands until they are ball-shaped.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a kind of cover.
The towns of Harappa and Mohingo Darou had a flush toilet in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
The remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the cities of Minoan, Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would use them together in a mixed company.
When you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The space satellite receives the call and then reflects it back at roughly the same time.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the atmosphere of the planet distorts some of the light and visibility.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways, but it's still the easiest and fastest way to get around.
We've brought the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
In a row below them are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits, turkeys, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray cats) that eat the smaller prey that are more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is a sense of status, a special job for each cat that keeps them from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of the cats and live in large groups called "coupes".
A lion family consists of one to three adult males, plus up to thirty females and cubs.
Females tend to be closer to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
The black wolf pack behaves like a wolf pack or a dog pack, and surprisingly, the animals are similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are very deadly to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well) and swim and jump for long distances and pull with five times the strength of a man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the tiger, and the yoruba. These four are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's full-voiced roar, but it is closer to the roar of angry words.
The pygmy leopard prefers to eat small animals, hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the pygmy leopard hunts are smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that the orchid cat tracks and finds prey by its sense of smell; it can smell where it has been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and they move very stealthily as well.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main group of populations to which they belong (for example if they have moved across a mountain range or river, or moved to a new island where they cannot easily return), they will find themselves, often, in a different environment from the one they were in before.
Because this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the new group will need different attributes or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than what it needed before.
The Aborigines haven't changed at all, and they still need the same ways of adapting as we did.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they gradually become less similar to other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
We call this process species evolution, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Moosa was the dominant predator of its day, so it was afraid of nothing, except for the other moosaurs.
Its long jaws were coated with over 70-year-old blades and another set in the roof of its mouth, which means there's no escape for anything that stands in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been carnivorous.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex was no match for it.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans have their share of odd or unusual holiday items, including wild boars, lobsters, lizards, and a type of rodent called the caterpillar.
There was another difference, that while the poor and women ate their meals sitting on benches, the rich men liked to have banquets together, where they were reclined on their side while they ate their homework.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included the foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods and it was considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods during ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard leading to a safe enclosure that only priests can enter.
Sometimes unique pyramid-shaped towers called zigguras were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for the god.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, home was not of great importance.
Most of the Jewish family's life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open antiques looking out onto the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was expensive.
The Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, the Eskimos used to live there.
There were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of the countries of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, even though each country was Scandinavian.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence is written on the back with the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, inverted.
Although the author of this portion of the text is not known for certain, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was a folded shelf at the beginning of its existence.
So, it's likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The landings of the day and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south had not yet been liberated.
France was ruled by Vichy, that's the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France, and they were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is an individual culture shared among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a community.
The origin of the word civilization is from the Latin civilis, which means civil, which is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, which is also defined in terms of social bloc.
Self-governing cities are the ancestors of nations. Urban culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, the preservation of cultural imprints and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Microcultures often disappear without leaving any real historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole element - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any authority to impose taxes, and because of its lack of national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
In addition, it has no authority to override tax laws and tariffs imposed between states.
The articles required unanimous approval by all the states before they could be amended and the states so ridiculed the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the clusters of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to geographically as an archipelago.
Taiwan's journey of recovery began in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Lha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change native grain production practices and employ Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) armies dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been recovered and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 millimeters, the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, the image sensor body of digital cameras has inherited the image width-to-height ratio.
The 35mm model is actually, a little bit confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this picture is (when divided by 12 to get the ratio of the simplest integer) so it's going to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the Advanced Image System suite of formats, for example) are equal to or approximate this width-to-height ratio.
The misused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in a clear form.
The most striking place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertical and horizontal (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity has bound European countries together for over a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The overwhelming power I possessed affected everyone from the king to the common people.
Among the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's cash funds are specifically for this reason.
For over a thousand years, the church in Rome was the central authority, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question the extent to which the requirements of the faith were met.
Britain quickly began to encircle Germany by sea after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating generally accepted international law, codified in several international conventions over the past two centuries.
Britain has blocked international waters to prevent any ship from entering whole sections of the ocean, threatening even neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were one of peacefulness and isolation.
After seeing the horrors of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid that situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each of China's stages or each dynasty was in power of a different kind.
In addition, each ruling dynasty had its own era of divided provinces, most famously the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war broke out between many nobles in pursuit of the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era is one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the highest seats in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from authoritarianism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just the ruler.
And after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military because instead of being class-based, the military's classifications are now based on rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class sons in other countries to unleash their own revolts.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this earthly life, and he used to frequent a cave known as the Hara on the mountain of light for meditation.
The al-Ghar itself, which has survived through the ages, offers a very vivid picture of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, and it's completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it at all, even if you know it exists.
Nothing can be seen but the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century of the present era, the Great Pyramid is one of the huge pyramids built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Cemetery City of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and the Aghul.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up" looks like a V, and the "down" looks like a square without the bottom.
A high sign means you should start at the end and push the bow, while a low sign means you should start at the end of the bow (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull it.
The upper arch usually produces a softer sound, while the lower arch is stronger and more belted
Feel free to draw your own markings in pencil, but remember that printed curves are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected as a rule.
Terrified, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Thérèse, 11, and Louis Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789 by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a huge crowd of people shouting and chanting against the king and queen.
A mob of revellers managed to force the King and Queen to open their car windows on their windowsills.
A gangster once waved the head of one of the royal guards killed at Versailles in front of the panicked queen.
The Filipino people have borne the cost of the US imperialist war in its invasion of the Philippines.
These people had to pay taxes to the American colonial system to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will be the main gains of American imperialism.
We have to understand the context of the organization's creation, to understand the Templars.
The era in which these events took place was known as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, all of which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the drive for technology or technological necessity to the strong sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic that is tied to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Two general ideas are shared by most explanations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on connected societies, rather than on society.
For example, one might say that the engine of the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But building a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for a handful of cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car ownership also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which leads to new technologies in health care to treat damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism derived from writers like Goethe, Vonnegut and Schlegel.
In the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geography-related customs and culture emerged, and these, as they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed rules.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its decline during the 12th century was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were worth much more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
And at this time Paris was named the fashion capital instead of Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
At first, Byzantine culture in the East heavily influenced clothing.
However, because of the slowness of the communication channels, the patterns in the West may be as much as 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to tie clothes.
Surplus farming is farming that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
The most commonly used form of organic farming is a simple system of stored seeds adapted to the ecosystem of the area, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Most farmers have historically worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures reconcile like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, race, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture's distinctiveness may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership through a different and symbolic use of style that includes clothing, costumes, and terminology.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of social nurture is to rely on the unfortunate few cases of children who have suffered, through neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, social disconnection from adults during their upbringing.
Some lost children have been locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment was due to the parents' refusal to disable the child's severe mental or physical disability.
The child predators may have been abused during childhood or severely traumatized before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) that are very similar to those of special-care animals, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping to provide support for individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and real, and in other words, a teacher is a form of interactive learning, and so is a Microsoft Office paper clipper.
Interactive learning is supported internally in the program and is intended to ask questions, motivate and explain actions that a student may find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, abuse, to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not based on nurturing, nurturing and education, but they are.
We know that the foster care system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and dependable health care.
The foster care must provide all the necessities they have missed in the homes they left.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and modes of fulfillment.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialisation" as important drivers of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reaction on websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting precise facial expressions, facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting subtle expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks points out in his paper that the president's speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are able to accurately assess honesty.
It suggests that these abilities to analyze human behavior are shared by some animals, such as pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of Chinese varieties: the hidden and the apparent.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection is removed from the expression pool.
The processes of separation and recombination randomly bring variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, primates with human-like digestive systems have a hard time meeting their requirements for amino acids from available plant resources.
Failure to do so will lead to dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most abundant plant resources were proteins that could be obtained from leaves and shoots, but these proteins are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termites, and eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high amounts of protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in some way similar to how chimpanzees do in the savanna.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep after a short period (10 to 60 minutes).
And this can be done easily using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options, based on biology, include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing a person to get up to pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The less stress, the more positivity that life gives strength. Everyone has the inherent ability to find peace and contentment.
The only thing that's holding us back is our own negativity and tension.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been extended through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, and it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces everyone.
You awaken the energy of Kundalini through yoga poses, breathing exercises, chanting and visualizing, with Kundalini Yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the god Yuga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the cooperation of the Soviet Union and the United States of America, but as the war ended, the clash of regimes, procedures and cultures led to the outbreak of conflict between the two states.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This war was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and to be fought on the ground, by proxy armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman Bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered the Soviet Union and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Tradition has it that the Navy's job is to ensure your country's ability to move your people and their goods, while at the same time, intercepting your enemy's ability to move theirs.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean in aid of Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to counter this invasion with its submarine force.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to invade Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
The domesticated goats were generally raised in herds roaming the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the widely known shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
Wagonways were created in England as far back as the 16th century.
Although the old railway carriages were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to pull greater loads than the roads that were considered more rugged at the time.
Train poles were invented relatively early to secure tracks, but it was later found that over time, putting an iron bar over the track made it more efficient.
This became the norm, but iron led to more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first complete iron bars were introduced.
Walking was the first form of transportation, humans started walking erect two million years ago, coinciding with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright in a steady way.
Two-legged species were found in the fossil record of the Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahylanthropus may have walked on two feet seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to some degree reduce future suffering.
This is just like treating the symptoms in many cases, but if we want a solution that's not just temporary, we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to end it.
It is clear enough that the world has changed so much because of man's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have become greater because of man's increased population and luxurious lifestyle.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary of the Treasury Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks from the building to John Dunlap's printing press.
And overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Cash Notes".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap scrolls represent the oldest surviving copies of the American Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs has survived and is alive today, and we call them birds.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have protective outer legs and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaur.
Virtually all computers in use today rely on processing information encoded in the form of binary digits.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, if we use the language of the term computer.
An immediate diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms such as vomiting, which is sufficiently common, appear.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be an open container of toxic medication or household chemicals.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions for the specific toxin.
Insectologists use the term "bug" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term is derived from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to intrude on humans.
Both killer and bed bugs have long incubation periods and are adapted to living in the nest or in the home of their host.
In the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely to develop MS as males.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to develop an adoption plan for their children.
In the adoption process, the original parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works through a scientific method, which is actually the way most scientific research is guided.
Although not unique in this regard, experimentation is a test that can be used to refute one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and, especially, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are critically dependent on the existence of, and often produced by, circadian cycles through the body's biological clock.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external cyclic signals, have been documented for most organisms, including those of bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Our biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue for periods of consecutive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chess used viruses or mites to insert their DNA into the germ.
They did two experiments to tag either the DNA of the amphibian using radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are from the germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells can only be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and fauna of the wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about the Bornean organgatuangs.
People leave small towns in their cars every morning to go to their workplaces and are met on the way by others who work at the place they just left.
In this vibrant transportation medium, everyone is somehow supported and connected by the transportation system that is the private car.
Science now suggests that this carbon-based mega-economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the past million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses transportation systems. Everyone complains about transportation systems.
You rarely hear such levels of complaints in developed countries about water quality or bridges that fall down.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic studies are difficult because you can't predict the behavior of a driver with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; with this, traffic has a reasonable consistency, which can be expressed mathematically approximately.
To better illustrate the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air, and their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to fold their wings backwards along the length of their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings today are the wasp and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many people thought otherwise; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel the earth moving, do you?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying eight times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times up to six miles wide.
20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the ancient Egyptian kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were not surpassed in size and technical excellence in construction.
The ancient Egyptians in the modern kingdom were amazed by the remains of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most state employees, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All the people of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, where all these elements can be detected in nature in their original form and can be extracted in a relatively easy way using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle postulated that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also assumed that they transform into new materials to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be minerals. And of course there are minerals like silver and gold as well.
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fill the space of the dot at the end of this sentence.
And then, the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it came out.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing instruments, the pencil has been relegated to a less prominent and useful position.
People now type messages on computer screens, without the need to use a match.
One has to wonder what the keyboard will be when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works by gathering energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
It's like a heavy cart rolling up a hill, the core breaks again and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no movement.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner underneath the Maria and thicker underneath the Highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is less dense.
Content theories are about finding what excites or draws people in.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that manifest spontaneously when they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want the things they do and the things in their environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's second factor theory.
In general, behaviour can appear when managers start to lead their former peers one of which is trying to remain "like the others".
This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary action, performance appraisals, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
And on the other end, the individual becomes unrecognizable, feeling that he/she has to change everything the team has and has done.
In the end, the leader is the one who is primarily responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflict between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical collections.
They often have greater autonomy than traditional team members as their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a real "secret team" has been described by Larsson and LaVasto (1989, p109) as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member reports to the Invisible Team management team, where the Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Innovation is one of the goals of implementing the concepts of institutional learning.
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be achieved.
As a result, synergies within the organization to overcome obstacles can result in the emergence of new innovative procedures that meet customer needs.
Before an organization is able to innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the continuity method as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neuroscience data provides tangible evidence of the theoretical approach to knowledge inquiry, thereby narrowing the field of inquiry and making it much more precise.
The link between neurology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the structure and processes of the brain in ways we never could before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves building machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Things like this have become separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have been used to build various home computer and video game applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often, a teacher may like to take her students to places where bus travel is not considered possible.
The technology enables the solution through virtual field visits. Students can view the museum's artifacts, visit the aquarium or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their classmates.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to recall a particular trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are kept online as a record.
Blogs can help students improve their writing. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience changes that overall.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be resourceful and useful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; by responding effectively to material on the web, students can identify their own positions in the context of others' writings as well as their own opinions on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital with a host of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
To the far south are Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the beautiful, untapped nature of Muscova and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as being what outsiders consider to be Canadian.
Large areas in the north are somewhat sparsely populated and some almost uninhabited.
To compare a demographic that surprises many: the number of African-American residents in the United States is more than the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island on the planet, and it's an independent continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it has spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the African coast, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Regardless of actual social status, women travelers should declare that they are married.
It's worth wearing a ring, but not the one that looks so expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they may consider harassment and that it is common to be spotted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't make it okay!).
The Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port called "Anfa" after its founding by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Darou to Padia, and Spanish merchants named it Casablanca who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least exciting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city, such as crocodiles, pottery, leather goods, shea and all kinds of cheap goods, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo, which flooded most of the city streets, and the city center in particular.
Any visits outside of Goma should be searched for to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province, whereas Goma is reasonably safe.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest trails for gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can ride a boda boda (a motorcycle that acts as a taxi) to get around the city of Goma, and the usual price (locally) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Besides being relatively inaccessible, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for faraway, strange lands.
Timbuktu is a poor city today, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, as well as its airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
One of the main stations was for Henry Louis Gates on the PBS series Africa's Own Wonders of the World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it is characterized by an Arab character rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park is 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is considered one of the attractions of South Africa, and its park is considered the main national park in South Africa (South African National Parks).
There is a daily fee for maintaining and entering the park, as in all national parks in South Africa.
It may be useful to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to enter a select group of South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is the place where many tourists consider their first stop.
The row of buildings that mark Hong Kong's skyline resemble a brightly-drawn diagram that appears over the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists took their place, so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt of coastal turtles in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) in the coastal areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is located within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they are some of the last evidence of the dense scrub that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometres, about one third of which is covered by water/marshes.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 brown deer in the area.
The inter-regional (across the river) internal buses depart during the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bomthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between neighbourhoods are often full, it is better to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by the small Japanese Kooster buses, which are comfortable and strong.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get around to nearby places, such as Barrow (Nu 150) and Bonaka (Nu 200).
The Ouyabouk River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Ouyabouk River to connect the cities of Ouyabouk in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-Louyabouk in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long, and have two 3.50 metres wide corridors.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, at the same time as the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay. The Guaraní lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, collecting plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies", arose as a result of a confrontation between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December, on the polo fields of Las Canitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches can be viewed here at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo games, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are often inserted.
In remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners beforehand to find out which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so the money must be exchanged before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is there when winter is in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; it is common for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make the weather colder than the thermometer indicates.
Rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year, with no distinct "rain" and "dry" seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay away from bears and wolves at least 100 yards per meter, and from all other wildlife 25 yards per meter!
As obedient as they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost every other large animal may attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't stay at a safe distance. These animals are big, they're wild, they're considered endangered, and that's why they have to be given their own space.
In addition, be aware that the smells are attractive to bears and other wildlife, so avoid handling or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
The capital city of Samoa is Apia, on the island of Upolu. It has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval skirmish in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 American and German personnel were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the death of the supreme commander, Toboah Tsamasis Lilovi III.
Because of Auckland's location between two harbors, there are many beaches, the most popular being located in three areas.
North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbor region) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and allow for safe swimming, and most are shaded by botox trees.
Tamaki Roads Beach is located on Whittematta Harbour, on the outskirts of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded with a good array of shops lining up on the beach.
The main popular beer is known as "Number One", which is not a complex drink, but a pleasant and refreshing drink. The other local beer is called "Manta".
French wines are plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more widespread.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find, if you're nervous.
For Australians, the idea of flat white coffee is a strange one. Small black coffee is espresso, cappuccino is a cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, fruit juices are excellent, though expensive.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and reef injuries rarely occur for any of these reasons.
However, seek advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near the beaches and estuaries from October to April 1770 north, and can occasionally be found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles don't normally live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A reservation assures the traveller that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Although you may find that it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with certain hotels.
Travel agents have traditionally offered packages including breakfast, airport transportation arrangements or even combined packages including flights and hotels.
They can also keep a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site, considering it an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the events, you have to get in early and get a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music at the main stages may have ended, sections of the festival may still play music late into the night.
Some festivals include special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as crossing the ice causes extremely noisy conditions for the most affected people.
Passengers on cruises are exempted from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money that guests spend.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment, to keep the guests in a good mood, and keep them in the building.
Some places offer free drinks, but drunkenness hinders good judgment and teaches all good gamblers the importance of keeping a sharp mind.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive as smoothly as if you were driving on soft ground.
And during blizzards, there may be enough snow to stop you for a very short time.
A falling ice, a gust of ice, a condensation process, or the presence of ice on car windows can cause limited visibility.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic is mostly continuous throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to cross-country travel to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, leopards, and tigers are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalking or a hiking) consists of a long walk, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
After Tokyo hosted the 1964 Olympic Games, it will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice.
If you book your 2020 flights and accommodation before the postponement is announced, you may face a situation of embarrassment.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not back until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with a typical cost of around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have a stove and a table for borrowing, even if it is not in the room.
If there is no air conditioning, or if you do not prefer to wear socks with air conditioning, then you can try using an air dryer, if available.
Do not overheat the fabric (which may cause it to shrivel or burn in the worst case).
There are different ways to purify water, some more useful against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, and in other areas, it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have any concerns, consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to them in their native areas.
They can spoil food, cause discomfort, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
The infectious diseases themselves, or the dangerous animals that can forcibly infect or kill people, are not usually described as pests.
Shopping in the free market is an opportunity to buy goods free of taxes and duties in certain places.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can, at times, save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Vermont contains the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as it passes regularly through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are always steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is more important than otherwise.
Oddly enough, it seems that cell phone service is stronger here than in many other areas stretching along the way, for example the Pennsylvania woods.
German pastry is very good, and in Bavaria it is very rich and varied, similar to the pastry of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry is popular, with apples being cooked in pastry throughout the year while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, walnuts, and other nuts. Folk cakes are often specially eaten with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small, rich pastries, try something called berliner or vanquokken or krabfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
A curry spring may be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes, while in South India and some other coastal areas of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines that are spread around Indonesia, given that there are 17,000 islands in Indonesia to differentiate between them.
But if used without additional terms, the term tends to mean that the food originated in the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of simply spicy dishes, the predominant flavours of Javanese preference being peanut, pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The legs are the supports for the rider's feet, resting on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can have safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If the rider falls off the horse but his foot is left stuck in the leash, he may be dragged if the horse runs away. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce that risk.
First, most equestrians wear riding boots with heels and a very tight soft heel.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the passenger's saddle to fall off the saddle when pulled back when the passenger is lowered.

Due to the underwater terrain, the backflow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a fast current may form into the deep water there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue in trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you swim out of the current, the swim back is no less easy than usual.
Try targeting a place where you're not being held by the current again or, depending on your skills and whether anyone notices your presence, waiting for rescue may be another option.
