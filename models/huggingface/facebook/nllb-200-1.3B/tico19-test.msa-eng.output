Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows a similar trend in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, although the extent varies by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the Italian experience, the country, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the surge of COVID-19 patients who will require health care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent of the disease was a new coronavirus now called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that about 80% of COVID-19 patients develop mild illness, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, with the majority of these patients recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progressed to a more severe illness and required hospital care, while the remaining 6% of cases developed a critical illness requiring intensive care.
Mortality rate of hospitalized patients from COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this study, we examined the cumulative trend of COVID-19 incidence in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared it with incidence in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 experienced a wider geographical spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following the dynamics of the pandemic in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first European with a confirmed COVID-19 case based on the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected across 30 EU/EEA and UK countries, between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 inclusive, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported by countries around the world is updated daily at 8.00 am. This figure is obtained only from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data was used to assess the COVID-19 trend in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compare it with the trend in Italy.
As a proxy for the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we counted the cumulative incidents over the past 14 days, so taking into account the natural travel of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and UK, in the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported by country as of 15 March 2020 at 8.00 compared to the Italian cases during the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
The 14-day cumulative incidence trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (Tiongkok) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, cumulative COVID-19 incidents started to rise around 21 February, and then sharply increased around 28 February 2020 (Additional material).
This trend was mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar trend in the increase in cumulative COVID-19 incidence (Additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
The data highlighted that, as of 15 March at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases comparable to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trend in cumulative COVID-19 incidence suggests that the pandemic is increasing at a comparable pace in all countries.
This is despite the differences in the levels experienced by countries, variations in public health responses, and possible differences in case definitions between countries and differences in protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region described the situation as around 10% of COVID-19 patients needing intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA level are available for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, data should be collected in a systematic manner to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 showed large variations in terms of the availability of intensive care beds and medical care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and mid-care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases for each EU/EEA country and UK associated with a risk of >90% exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
As cases are so far clustered in specific regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve a specific regional service coverage population, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the level of the Regional Unit Designation for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is expanding very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as occurred in the affected regions of Italy.
As demonstrated in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approach is critical to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from containment approach to mitigation approach, as the rapid increase in case numbers, as anticipated, may not give enough time to decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the appropriate response if it is not implemented sooner.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity when countries have the possibility to further enhance their management efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the pressure on healthcare.
If it fails, the healthcare systems of other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a surge of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing catastrophic human deaths.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality rates than SARS, but is more contagious and affects older people more than younger people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on this emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding research subject.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
While there are still many unanswered questions, we hope this study will help us understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were ordered to stay at home during the holidays and the weeks after due to the outbreak of the new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being discharged and 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is public enemy number one and has the potential to do more damage than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020 that established virus sequences isolated from several patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, covering its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review seeks to summarize the research progress in this rapidly evolving new subject area.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-caused diseases, namely Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis as well as some other unanswered but urgent questions.
Traditionally, CoVs are considered nonlethal pathogens to humans, primarily causing about 15% of colds 4.
Yet, in this century, we have found two highly pathogenic CoVs to humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing outbreaks that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to many other countries with appalling morbidity and mortality.
As such, COVID-19 is currently the third coronavirus outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a pneumonia cluster of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, a healthcare provider infection was reported, indicating that human-to-human transmission may occur.
On January 23, a provincial quarantine was imposed in Wuhan city and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients who came into direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market were considered to be the initial site of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. 2).
As the situation develops so rapidly, the final scope and severity of the outbreak has yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following more updated epidemiological picture (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but mainly in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, only a few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 infected were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is spreading in clusters, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The mean time from incubation to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproduction figure (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the appropriate R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, coinciding with the time of mass transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality in patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a large subfamily of sample-containing viruses containing single-stranded sense RNA.
CoVs can be divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoVs known to infect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cell receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and dipoptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA is joined by the envelope glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid protein to form a virion-containing vesicle, which then undergoes fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic similarity among the 10 samples sequenced; the samples were taken from the site of the outbreak, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the very thin epithelial part of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than it does to the S protein of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections that are not as severe as SARS-CoV infections in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded by orf3b and proteins secreted by orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b protein may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete human ACE2 cryo-EM structure at a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has both open and closed conformations, is composed of dimer-forming molecules and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins, which are evidence for CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target in drug filtration to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original host and intermediary
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from bats and are respectively transmitted to humans via foxes and camels.
Through phylogenetic comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the original hosts of SARS-CoV-2 as this new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helps the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans is still unknown, and the route of transmission has yet to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans involving homologous recombination in the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that the common ant-eating long-nosed ant-eating mammal in traditional Chinese medicine, may be a SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host based on 99% genetic homology to CoVs found in the ant-eating ant and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread across the genome is still a large difference; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Fig. 3).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, acetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, effectively inactivated the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies reporting on immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other previous CoV studies, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).4).
In general, after invading a host, the virus is recognized by the innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and the synthesis of type I interferon (IFN) which restricts viral spread and accelerates the phagocytosis of viral antigens by macrophages.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid an immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect the cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complementary, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies is also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system produces large amounts of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst-case scenario, organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by a chronic cluster, is more prevalent in elderly with disease participants and pregnant women.
Generally, people who are exposed to large amounts of the virus or whose immune function is impaired have a higher chance of being infected than others.
Estimates of the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 are 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as described above, suggest that the incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust effective quarantine times based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent people who are infected, but without symptoms, from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people exposed to the virus or infected are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early symptom of COVID-19, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients develop dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia one week after onset of disease.
In severe cases, the patient's disease progresses rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/ or acute respiratory and febrile symptoms, even without pulmonary imaging disorders, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the symptom percentage was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, one in family clusters and the other in clusters caused by transmission from asymptomatic people.
By comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients require ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with higher MERS-related mortality than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were indicated as the primary symptoms and ventilation support was required for about 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was at 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
By comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that SARS-CoV-2's R0 reached as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV's R0 ranged only from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 is given in Table 1.
The figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread rate than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but does not equate to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Clustered flows are often found within a family or from a group or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients in the last two weeks before transmission.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, prompting caution to increase quarantine time.
In the early stages, patients have normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell (especially lymphocyte) counts.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes a lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Liver and muscle enzyme and myoglobin levels increased in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive protein and blood clotting rate increased in the majority of patients.
In patients with severe cases, levels of D-dimer, the breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, increase, and the number of lymphocytes decreases progressively.
Photothoracic dysfunction is found in a large proportion of COVID-19 patients and is characterized by bilateral hazy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often have atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly exacerbate the gas exchange disorder.
Type I and type II pneumocytosis decreases surfactant levels and increases surface pressure to the extent that it decreases the lung's ability to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
So the worst findings on the thoracic scan often parallel the most severe disease rates.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocytosis, formation of the hyaline membrane, and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as multi-nucleated sensitized cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, consistent with viral infection pathology and ARDS as well as similar to the pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false negative rate, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurs with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is crucial and a must for making an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang's group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a dipping stick in less than an hour without requiring complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and ease if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with new CoVs, physicians primarily offer supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying out a range of therapies that have been previously used or proposed for the treatment of other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).2).
These therapies include current and potential therapies with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been proposed for therapeutic use.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the major threats to patients and the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential for symptom relief and saving lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, electrolyte balance maintenance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protection of vital organ function are also of great importance for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
An overreaction of the immune system is known to cause a cytokine storm in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storms are a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, which include TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals which are the primary cause of ARDS and complex organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the management of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; suppression of cytokine 4 signaling; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Conversely, steroids can cause severe side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which greatly affect prognosis.
However, short-term administration of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids is recommended to be used with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in a COVID-19 patient from the United States.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, again for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition against other single-stranded RNA viruses, which include MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound for China to conduct a series of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medicinal products used by patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody manufacturing
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from contracting the disease.
Indeed, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
An antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight off pathogens as well as other foreign bodies, recognize unique molecules in pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, accompanied by decreased inflammation and viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification would need to be done to propose such methods for large-scale use before specific therapies are developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effects, several plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
Blood concentrations of antibodies are usually low and large amounts of plasma are needed to treat critically ill patients.
Developing and producing specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic is difficult.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic code that binds to effective antibodies or performs effective antibody screening against proteins that are important for the virus.
This way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of various components in the formula.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify those components or their optimal combination.
Currently, as effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 are not yet available, TCM is becoming one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illness.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsule and the Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest cure rates in COVID-19 patient therapy were observed in several Chinese provinces that used TCM at 87% of their patients, which included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM at only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, have to be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) therapy alone with combined WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, symptom relief, and hospitalization was significantly shorter in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
More impressively, the rate of symptom worsening (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients feel very frightened of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely, and angry.
Furthermore, infectious symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as side effects of therapy such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor disturbances, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even schizophrenia have been reported.
Mandatory contact history tracking and quarantines, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantines, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspects, and people in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with routine and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapy plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to break the chain of transmission from the reservoir of infected animals and humans to vulnerable hosts and often complement antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by emergence of the virus.
Efforts have been made to develop an S protein-based vaccine, which in the long term and effectively creates a protective antibody and/or immunity that neutralizes against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, a live-attenuated vaccine has been evaluated in experimental animals.
However, the in vivo efficacy of this vaccine candidate in the elderly and in lethal challenge models as well as its protection against zoonotic virus infection has yet to be determined before clinical studies are initiated.
This is probably because SARS subsided 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and have been partially evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easily overcome due to the long time to develop a vaccine (average 18 months) and the dynamic variation of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show its full clinical pathway in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the development of disease prognosis models is crucial for healthcare organisations to prioritise their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs mainly in the 30-65 age group with 47.7% of patients being over 50 years of age in the 8,866 case study as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care tend to have participant comorbidities and complications and are significantly older than patients not requiring intensive care (median age 66 years versus 51 years), which suggests age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more males than females (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to have acute heart injury and arrhythmias.
Cardiac events are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind to ACE2-positive colangiocytes, which may result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying disease are highly correlated and can influence each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and are proposed as potential prognostic factors for disease, response to therapy, and eventual recovery.
A correlation between CRP levels and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, increases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict end results.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So these enzymes are the traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: Thoracic photography and the development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other factors to predict the end result and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants widely used as supportive therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of the disease end up suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short durations in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients suffered extreme stress as they had to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be provided to help the patient recover from stress and return to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have a different epidemiological picture from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, in the early phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which poses great difficulties for controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV is believed to occur when patients are severely ill and most do not occur in the early phase.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is far more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, a major effort is underway in China, which includes the quarantine of Wuhan province and surrounding cities as well as the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of interrupting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
While this action has severely damaged the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new cases has declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase lasts for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are less optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-conch and throat saliva of patients who had recovered and returned from the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the re-identified virus could be a recurrent episode, similar to influenza.
However, promising signs are showing up in China, based on the decline in the number of new cases, suggesting that the current strategy may be successful.
Ebola is predicted to re-emerge with a million cases and half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease is finally under control.
It is also possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappears or becomes a less pathogenic virus that can coexist with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Fig. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in feces, which raises the possibility of a new transmission, fecal-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be due to nosokomial infection, which included 17 patients with other pre-existing diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions should be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, and even people who happen to be in contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (serial number 1860s) help to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent the spatter of saliva from potentially infected persons from entering the air or sticking to the surface of the material, where the spatter can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions with sizes as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions being able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, both measuring around 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked into one, health care providers who come into direct contact with patients should wear N95 (serial number 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation garments to further reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflammation of the eye.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear a translucent face shield or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
Three feet is believed to be the best distance to keep from patients.
These measures are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection as well as preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus to the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should be a great reminder for China which has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured the population by saying that the new virus has low transmission characteristics and limited human-to-human reproductive capacity and that prevention and containment of the disease is not a problem.
This message has greatly calmed public fears, especially as the entire country is preparing for the Spring Festival, until this critical time is too late to contain the small-scale disease in Wuhan.
The disease control agency in China should learn from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, the agency should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is noted by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from the clinic than to wait for an official report from the doctor or authorized officer; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain the potential epidemic at an early stage, and not try to calm the public; and (4) more frequently issue targeted and effective training to raise public awareness about the epidemic and test and improve community response systems on a periodic basis.
The COVID-19 outbreak is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that began spreading in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the outbreak has spread throughout China and more than 50 countries around the world as of this writing.
As the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, the COVID-19 outbreak has the effect of a recurrent SARS outbreak.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are crucial to contain the epidemic and manage patients.
COVID-19 affects more elderly than young people and more men than women, and the death rate is also higher in older than young people.
SARS mortality was higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are severely ill. This makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains part of the reason SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can again test positive for the virus.
This finding greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, several important issues remain to be resolved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite finding a 96% genetic homology between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like SARS-like CoVs, we have not yet been able to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
What animal species are the intermediaries for transmitting the virus from the original host, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing answers 1 and 2, we can't effectively disrupt the transmission and the plague could re-spread at any moment.
While molecular modeling and biochemical origins suggest that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does this virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will this pandemic become a global pandemic, ending like SARS, or recurring periodically like the flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are important, but they may take time to find.
However, at any cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zoonotic origin of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its host, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the situation and revealed how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought the CoV back into the spotlight and surprised us with its high transmission, but with a lower pathogenicity than its sibling, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis. Therefore, understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs will be beneficial to us.
Most HCoVs originate in bats. In these animals, the virus is not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of several HCoVs have also been identified.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human disease.
Animal studies of host-CoV interactions may also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoVs in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current knowledge about the seven HCoVs, focusing on their history of discovery as well as their zoonotic origin and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast these HCoVs from the point of view of evolution and genomic recombination.
The current 2019 (COVID-19) CoV disease epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host transition and the implications of viral evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
The coronavirus (CoV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of enveloped, positive-stranded, single-stranded RNA viruses.
It has the largest genome at 26 to 32 kilobytes among RNA viruses called "CoV", due to its crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Based on its structure, the CoV has an unsegmented genome that has a similar arrangement.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that overlap each other, both of which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
The polyprotein undergoes further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open reading frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which includes the bulge or spike (S), the sheath or envelope (E), the membrane (M), and the nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complementary proteins specific to specific lineages are also encoded by various CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among those four genera, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoVs and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while poultry are the major reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed the species barrier and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
To date, there are seven known human CoVs (HCoVs).
Of these seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower-grade respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and having a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung organs.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the ingus of a cold-stricken patient in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-healing symptoms.
In fact, it was widely accepted that HCoV infection was generally harmless, until the SARS outbreak occurred.
The SARS outbreak of 2003 was one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a crude mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a sustained epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to various other parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), hereinafter referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic, which has claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm has sounded and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins from bats, mice, or pets.
There is ample evidence supporting the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats. In bats, CoVs are well adapted and nonpathogenic, but show considerable genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed extraordinary medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges to China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origin of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces, and limiting factors of occurrence of interspecies transmission.
The study may also guide or facilitate the search for reservoir hosts, intermediates, and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which has important implications in preventing future spread.
In this review, we provide an overview of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCoV pathogenesis.
We specifically highlighted and discussed the general topic that HCoVs are typically nonpathogenic in their natural reservoir, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trends of HCoVs that increased transmissibility is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The end result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the ingus of cold-affected patients, various CoVs had been isolated from a variety of infected animals, which included turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
The HCoV-229E strain was first isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, which was subsequently adapted for growth in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E show symptoms of the common cold, which include headache, sneezing, dizziness, and sore throat, accompanied by fever and cough seen in 10~20% of cases.
Subsequently in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and sequential serial bands in the mammalian brain.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection appears similar to infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from other respiratory tract pathogen infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed and tend to be most transmitted during winter in temperate regions.
Typically, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week and is followed by a sickness period of about two weeks.
Based on a human volunteer study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems show lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first well-documented HCoV-caused pandemic in human history and its etiological agent was SARS-CoV, which was the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from super-infectious, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load seen on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, dizziness, and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough, and shortness of breath as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and elevated creatinine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Alveolar diffusion damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophage have also been observed in SARS patients.
Furthermore, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys may also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be fatal, especially in patients with weakened immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of patient zero who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially very common in young children, the elderly, and debilitated patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
Chorionic, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are commonly found in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from nasal specimens of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, the virus has actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses and its peak occurrence occurs in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.
These four communities of HCoVs have all adapted to humans and generally have a low probability of mutating into highly pathogenic diseases.
Generally, when gaining the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend itself in humans, the virulence and pathogenicity of these HCoVs also decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contact have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to the clinical manifestation of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute renal failure, which so far has only occurred in MERS among HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high case fatality rate, i.e. of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most fearsome viruses known to man.
In mid to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude case fatality rate of 3.4%.
It should be noted that case fatality in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, while case mortality outside Hubei was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with the appearance of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea has also been found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their high nucleotide sequence homology, of 82%, the two are clustered into branches of different phylogenetic trees.
The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, but more contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects have been reported and may have played a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation time and duration of HCoV disease travel are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows a general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four other community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more general picture seen in Community HCoV infection, which includes a picture of mild or even symptomless nonspecific symptoms.
On the other hand, a small proportion of severe COVID-19 cases can be seen as SARS-CoV infection although at a slightly lower ratio.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting pattern characteristics, having similarities with community HCoVs as well as SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community HCoVs.
On the other hand, the decline in the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 after several strains in humans has yet to be verified, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from fecal samples.
"Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role, as in the case of transmission of SARS-CoV, at least in certain situations, has yet to be clarified by further studies".
It is also very important to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of community HCoVs.
However, the outline of SARS-CoV-2, which includes the ability of transmission, pathogenicity, and sustained spread in multiple pathways in humans, will greatly influence the eventual fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
Four communal HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoVs and humans may be ancient HCoV pandemic survivors.
The HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans that suffer from severe HCoV disease have been destroyed.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient quantities to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations to fight host restriction factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community CoVs circulated in the human population and triggered colds in immunocompetent people.
This virus doesn't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoVs and MERS-CoVs have not adapted to humans and their transmission in humans is not sustainable.
Both must defend themselves and breed in zoonotic reservoirs and seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar profile to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community HCoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 is very transmissible like community HCoVs, at least for now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoVs and is not as pathogenic as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether SARS-CoV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without reservoir animal hosts or intermediates.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, we need to discuss the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplifier definitions and characteristics of HCoVs.
Animals act as evolutionary hosts of HCoVs if they have a closely related ancestor and share high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and nonpathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the reservoir host carries HCoVs continuously and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host for the HCoV or parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoVs have only entered an intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus has not adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
These intermediate hosts can serve as zoonotic sources of human infection and act as amplification hosts by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate, then transmit it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoVs can become deadly if they cannot sustain transmission in an intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemisticity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveal retrospectively that zero SARS cases have had a history of contact with game animals.
Further seroprevalence studies indicated that the animal sellers had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Moon foxes (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in live animal markets were the first to be identified carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the foxes in the market were killed.
However, it was reported that moons from wild or farmed non-exposed to live animal markets were largely negative for SARS-CoV. This suggests that moons may only act as an intermediate amplifier host, but not a natural reservoir for SARS-CoV.
It should be noted, since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be excluded that possibly many small mammal species also serve as SARS-CoV intermediate amplifier hosts.
All of these hosts appear to be end hosts of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV further revealed a closely related bat CoV, called Rhinolopus bat CoV-SARS relative HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
This study laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts for emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from bat faeces samples was shown to use ACE2 from bats, foxes, and humans as receptors to enter into cells.
Interestingly, the serum of a convalescent SARS patient was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest-related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, with 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high level of homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not hosts of the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same cluster as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat-HKU4 CoV and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), as the virus entry route.
The RNA polymerase-dependent RNA sequence of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to its matches in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be direct reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East showed that Arab camels gave seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, similar to camels native to the Middle East in some African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal mucus of the Arabian camel. This further indicates that the camel is the actual reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive viral decay with usually mild symptoms was observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that infected camels transmit the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of the virus from bats.
However, the question remains unanswered as many confirmed MERS cases have no history of contact with camels prior to onset of symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with the bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from the bat Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to establish a parent relationship.
In other words, bats may not be hosts of the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, unless a near-identical bat CoV is discovered later.
It is likely that the animal hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate were among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggest that a group of endangered small mammals, known as the trellis (Manis javanica), may also carry an ancestral beta-CoV that is related to SARS-CoV-2.
The new alligator CoV genome shares 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoVs are closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
Both are grouped into two sub-lines - the SARS-CoV-2-like virus lineages in the phylogenetic tree, one sharing a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4%.
Remarkably, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are significantly different, although the level of whole genome sequence homology is higher.
Previous studies in sick alligators also reported the detection of contig virus from lung samples, which also turned out to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different composition methods and manual curation to produce a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the complete virus genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility of alligators as one of the animal hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 originating directly from quail due to sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and quail's SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV relatives.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and its SARS-CoV-2 cousin beta-CoV.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, crustaceans, and other mammals has yet to be determined.
While the highest sequence homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 algae, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest sequence homology at genome-wide sequence level.
It is over-speculative to say that the high degree of similarity between RBD beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 of the ground squirrel and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by convergent evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
The comparison hypothesis supports a recombination between the beta-CoVs of the SARS-CoV-2 relatives of the pencil-needle and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driver, recombination is common among beta-CoVs.
Researchers have yet to decide on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been investigated.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 parent viruses have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American triple-colored bats showed close affinity to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with Camelidae also suspected to be its intermediate host.
For clarity, current knowledge of the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of historical occurrence of HCoVs interspecies transmission.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed species from livestock to infect humans, a pandemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E interspecies transmission is not very clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E have been identified.
Among them, there is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have come into contact with bats in shared ecological niches.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are diverse and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoVs cause outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoVs are not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas acquiring the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility is that while bat alpha-CoVs serve as the HCoV-229E gene loops, alpacas and Arabian camels may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just as MERS-CoVs do.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to Arabian camels and from Arabian camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was known at the initial identification of the virus and was also reinforced by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats are a rich breeding ground for virus species for interspecies genetic fragment exchange and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, a tightly-organized colony, close social interaction, and strong flight abilities all favored conditions for bats to be ideal 'virus spreaders.'
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering the Arabian camel for decades.
The virus has adapted to camels that have changed from an intermediate host to a stable, natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans occurs by chance and humans remain the final host for MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of quail, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, the trellis beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in trellis.
The rooster may be the final host for the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV, similar to the fox in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 interspecies from animals to humans should be considered or ruled out.
First, bats could be a reservoir host for the SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is nearly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share the ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, quail may have been one of the intermediate amplifier hosts for the newly introduced SARS-CoV-2 related virus.
Humans get the virus through slaughter and meat consumption.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody tests on pets and wildlife are needed.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that comes into contact with both bats and crustaceans.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three main factors from the viral side are also important to facilitate CoVs crossing the species barrier.
First, the relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of CoV mutation can be considered moderate to high with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of the CoV to the new host.
CoVs have a corrective exoribonuclease, the elimination of which results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of mutation of the CoV is about a million times higher than the rate of mutation of the host.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CoV has not yet adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoVs which have a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is actually lower, suggesting a higher degree of adaptation with humans.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also the case in MERS-CoV which has adapted to Arabian camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift will quickly render vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs provides extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thereby increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is favorable for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by the abundance of unique open reading frame and protein functions encoded toward the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often change templates randomly during RNA replication through a unique select-copy mechanism.
In hosts that serve as mixing vessels, strand switching occurs frequently during transcription of CoV RNA.
Complete and highly homologous subgenomic RNAs can undergo recombination to form new CoVs.
Phyllogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Host-virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptors is another major factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a special case, which also shows evidence of positive selection during the incidence of interspecies transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between human and fox isolates of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV is suspected to undergo rapid adaptation in a variety of hosts, particularly with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and intensively becomes a target of host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid on the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its correceptors as a viral entry pathway.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, which include bats, foxes, rats, and raccoons, thus allowing for interspecies virus transmission.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed differently between human and fox virus isolates in RBD and 4 of these were located in receptor binding motif for interaction with ACE2 receptor.
Fox SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of the interaction of the proton protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be crucial for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies that the binding affinity of the S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed the binding affinity of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein to be 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also important to know whether other correceptors may be needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-therasethylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans following interspecies transmission from its animal host.
In addition to cell receptors, the end result of interspecies HCoV transmission is also governed by other host dependence and restriction factors.
These host protein differences between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arabian camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must take over host dependence factors and break through host restriction factors in order to be successful in interspecies transmission.
In this case, the molecular determinants in this important virus-host interaction domain have yet to be identified and characterized.
Unbiased whole genome screening to look at the host's dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using state-of-the-art CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to the beginning of the outbreak
Bat CoV diversity provides a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, the bat CoV functions as a gene locus for the HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein-coding gene has the potential to drastically modify the viral phenotype.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans because isolated SARS-CoV-CoV related bat virus was found to encode a diverse ORF8 protein.
SARS-CoV with a characteristic of 29 nucleotide deletion was found in strains isolated early in the human epidemic.
This deletion separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that supports host transition.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineages, with a large number of smaller recombinant regions identified in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and partially nsp14.
Similarly, the incidence of recombination between different lineages was shown to occur in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs have recombined with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can play a role in unintended changes in the viral genome, most likely caused by the release of the virus from the selection stress it undergoes, such as by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to the removal of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 was observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpacas showed single nucleotide insertions that resulted in skeletal shift.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressures in their reservoir hosts.
Mild or no symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoV, indicating mutual adaptation between CoV and bats.
It appears that bats adapt well to the CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a defect in activating the proinflammatory response in bats would efficiently reduce CoV-induced pathology.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats was suppressed due to increased regulation of the NKG2/CD94 inhibitor natural killer cell receptor and low levels of expression of the class I major histocompatibility complex molecules.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from high bat metabolic activity can suppress CoV replication and affect correction by exoribonucleases thus putting selection pressure on the production of highly pathogenic virus strains upon entry into new hosts.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
CoVs replicate vigorously without triggering a strong host immune response.
Herein lies the secret of an asymptomatic carrier and the cause of severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are primarily due to overactivation of the immune response as well as cytokine storms, with lung damage becoming more severe if the immune response becomes stronger.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been spared from replication of the CoV.
The same strategy for determining the correlation of immune responses may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, inflammasome activation of NLRP3 in bats is defective.
For this reason, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by MCC950 may be useful in the management of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoVs that share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also bat CoVs that share 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although foxes and other animals in the market were found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, direct intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been found.
A highly homologous pentagon beta-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, suggesting that pentagon may act as one of the intermediate hosts or that pentagon beta-CoV may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While questionable, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans either intentionally or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have significantly changed our perceptions of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs for HCoVs in human transmission.
There is considerable evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and foxes in wet markets, it is likely that the closure of the wet market and the killing of all foxes in it effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, quail should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several beta-CoV lineages of quail that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans via crustaceans and other mammals has yet to be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arabian camel for a long time.
The camel serves as an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local community.
The Arab camel is widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we cannot kill all camels to control MERS, as is done in the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop a vaccine for camels that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we can eliminate this virus, a new genotype could emerge and cause an epidemic.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, the bat CoVs that are potentially zoonotic are highly diverse.
There is a high probability that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparedness and management plans should be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet since ancient times.
These viruses are in their natural reservoir until there's a chance for spread.
Although bats possess many characteristics that support the spread of the virus, the chances of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are instructed to stay away from wildlife.
Continuous surveillance of mammals should be undertaken to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which would prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to keep a distance from the ecological niche of the natural reservoir of zoonotic viruses.
Some pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not been discovered.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to alligators, the conditions when bats and alligators share ecological niches are important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans contact bats should be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that acts as an actual intermediate host, the way that mammal interacts with other species, which includes humans, bats, and penguins, should be explained.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infection and surveillance should be undertaken.
Whether it is a bat, a penguin, or another mammal, it is hoped that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent virus can be identified in its natural host in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and management of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating of diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 should be done
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and management of the new 2019 (2019-nCoV) coronavirus infection.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnosis and management strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we respond to one of the comments in our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases based on the Diagnostic and Management Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is currently formally called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide was published online in Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
The guide has attracted much attention since its publication.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnosis and management strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Management Guide for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the commission issued a total of seven editions with some of the context changed considerably.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., who introduced a proposal for a modest score based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guide and is a valuable reference for the global pandemic.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also requires updates based on the latest Diagnostic and Management Guide for COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and the latest studies.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case a combination of one of the epidemiological history descriptions with two clinical manifestations is required to make a comprehensive analysis, or the fulfilment of three clinical manifestations is required if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and its surrounding districts, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with a contagious case of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and its surrounding districts, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in 2 weeks in a small area, such as a home, office, school classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts indicate normal, decreased, or reduced lymphocyte counts at the early stage of onset.
Diagnosing confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) whole-virus genome sequence showing high homogeneity for the new known coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM-specific antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing; or change of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies from negative to positive, or increased titer ≥4 fold at recovery phase above the rate at acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing of nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogenic detection on blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on the researchers' ongoing research to find optimal nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood collection, which enhances the availability of various specimens, and supports the inclusion of positive results of specific antibodies into the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is growing evidence that warns us to be wary of patients with atypical and asymptomatic conditions.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in future clinical practice and studies.
In closing, we hope more direct evidence will emerge and ask readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of suspected and confirmed cases, we recommend following and adhering to the latest guidance in their respective countries.
Our team will also update our guidance periodically as a backup.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in one day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the total number of recorded infection cases including 114 active cases and 33 cured cases living at home.
There are 17 deaths.
In an online news release, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two cases were between 51 and 60 years old, and one case was between 41-50 years old.
It also says the two victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport would be suspended longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The public transportation shutdown has been in effect since March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of basic goods -- medicines, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on 8 March, in two people who had just returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19, all three were cured.
SARS-CoV-2 infections surpass one million worldwide
As of Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak occurred on the same day as Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States (US), there have been more than 244,000 cases of the coronavirus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reports, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there are more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world are announcing tighter measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the regional quarantine until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russian citizens would continue to be paid without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament held a vote to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions, and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to all day; previously, the curfew was only in place between 3pm and 6am.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the curfew until May 1.
Stores in Australia lowered the limit on toilet paper purchases per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian retail chains Woolworth and Coles respectively lowered the purchase limit of toilet paper to two and one packs per transaction at all stores nationwide.
ALDI also imposes a one-pack limit, on Monday.
The restrictions were announced as a message on the cashier and on his Facebook page.
Buyers are reportedly piling up supplies due to fears of COVID-19 if the community is forced to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one packet per order.
The change follows the four-pack limit per transaction previously applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
In its media statement on March 8, Coles reported that with the imposition of the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still running out of supplies within an hour of shipment", calling the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales "surged sharply" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco in Canberra also limited the allowance to two packs last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of shipments, Woolworths ordered additional preparations, while ALDI made preparations for special Wednesday promotional activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers were trying to improve their inventory, but local government agency restrictions on truck delivery times made it difficult.
It anticipates rising production costs, as suppliers struggle to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to having unpacked early, some stores could not hold special Wednesdays.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist from Queensland University of Technology, said the store fills up with supplies every night.
It emphasizes that toilet paper is a bulk commodity so that the supply is low and, if sold out, creates so much empty space on the shelves that scarcity becomes more noticeable.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there are lots of items on the shelf, if products like toiletries and sanitizers can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, panic may be minimized, says Russel Zimmerman via ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet tissue Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissues, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, stress they work 24/7 to keep supplies, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidders of an auction in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held as buyers took a break for the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of inserts intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were actually reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, saying they had no plans to impose any purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitizers, dry foods, hand soap, and flour.
Similarly outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the British online supermarket Ocado was observed to restrict the purchase of Andres's toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak - the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus - as a pandemic.
While the word "pandemic" refers only to how widespread the disease has become, not how dangerous the cases are, WHO notes the need to urge governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, and mobilize their people in response, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO.
We are very wary of both the alarming rate of spread and severity and the alarming slowdown in action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
It said, in a note published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, no respiratory virus has ever been traced from its emergence to its continued global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus".
It continues, "and we have never seen a pandemic that can be managed at the same time".
The new pandemic status follows a decision by the WHO in January that declared the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "The bottom line is, it's going to get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the ongoing pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and is caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a Worldwide Public Health Verification on 30 January 2020, and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been cured.
The case fatality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide ranges from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptom onset is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth during coughing, maintaining distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation of people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, night curfews, workplace hazard management, and closures of facilities.
The pandemic has caused severe global socioeconomic disruption, postponements or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sporting activities, and widespread supply shortages of goods exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have been closed both nationally and locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the student population worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has been spreading online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions are declining.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei province), reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is suspected to have zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus and is related to the bat coronavirus, the hawker coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and the person had no apparent connection to the later mentioned wet market cluster.
Among the initial cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case traceable to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was likely the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, with new cases reported declining in China, but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China has exceeded the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported among young people, with people aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.
Cases refer to the number of people who have tested for COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocol.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have adopted official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections went undetected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was estimated to be higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure was likely 5.7.
Most of the COVID-19 patients are cured.
For those who did not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death was between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing health conditions, which include cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual fatality rate from COVID-19 may be much higher, given that the official figures probably do not include people who died without testing, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the total surplus death toll during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death calculations by a factor of 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual figure", a statement reinforced by unscientific reports of undercounting in the US.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
As of 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths have been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy respectively.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
This figure varies by region and over time, as well as being influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case-to-case mortality ratio was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
This figure varies by region.
In China, the estimated death-to-case ratio decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptom onset 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptom onset after 1 February 2020). Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a particular disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) people who die from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates the infection fatality rate for the pandemic as a whole to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper range of these estimates is in line with the results of the first randomized testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO has confirmed that the pandemic is manageable.
The peak and end of the duration of the outbreak is unclear and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University states, "Without control, infectious outbreaks typically flatten out and then begin to decline as the disease runs out of available hosts.
However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at present as to when it will happen".
Senior medical adviser to the Chinese government Zhong Nanshan argued that "the outbreak may end in June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for up to one or two years".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical restraint and other measures would be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, because it's so easily transmitted, could disappear completely" and that the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year".
The virulence of the repeats will depend on the herd's immunity and mutation rate.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively nonspecific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms were fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory sputum (phlegma), loss of the ability to smell, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including difficulty breathing, depressed chest or stagnant chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and blueness of the face and lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear.
Some infected individuals may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who have close contact with confirmed infected individuals should be closely monitored and screened to ensure they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic ratio to range from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) typically ranges from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days.
Details of how the disease spreads are still being investigated.
COVID-19 is believed to be spread primarily by close contact and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has found that an uncovered cough can cause drip droplets pushed 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers speculate that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that linger longer in the air and are produced when speaking.
The droplet may fall into the mouth or nose of a person nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary cardiac resuscitation (CPR), can cause respiratory secretions to be converted into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Transmission can also occur when a person touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then touches eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus could spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government dismissed the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by fecal-oral route. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may occur before symptoms are apparent and at later stages of the disease.
People tested positive up to three days before symptom onset, indicating transmission may have occurred before significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of asymptomatic cases have been laboratory confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by several countries during contact tracing research.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease is spread, one person typically infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All of the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are associated with the coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by exposure to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the early SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two strains of bat-derived.
The virus has 96% similarity at genome-wide level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only a single amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the Tengri virus and the human virus.
To date, genome-wide comparisons have found the most 92% similarity in genetic material between the coronavirus tenggering and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that tenggering is a mediator host for SARS-CoV-2.
Infection by the virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is eventually made through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on infected secretions or bypassing CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19".
WHO has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, which was first distributed on 17 January.
Testing using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be done on breath or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is done on nasopharyngeal swabs, but throat swabs can also be used. A number of laboratories and enterprises are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these serological tests have been shown to be accurate enough to be widely approved for use.
In the US, the serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of radiographic imaging and computed tomography (CT) in symptomatic persons include asymmetrical peripheral glass ground opacity and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although less specific for infection, imaging was so faster and more sensitive that it was recommended to consider it as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging features of the virus with X-rays and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining comprehensive good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing a towel when coughing or sneezing and immediately disposing of the towel in the garbage.
People who may already be infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical restrictive measures were also recommended to prevent transmission.Governments in various provinces have restricted or called for the cessation of all non-essential travel to and from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached community-scale spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in the community, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers dealing with people who may be infected are advised to take standard precautions, contact prevention measures, and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has sparked privacy concerns, with statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of a user's distance to another mobile phone.
Furthermore, users will receive messages if they are in close proximity to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Misspoints about how to prevent infection are circulating; for example, rinsing the nose and flushing with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are visible; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that breaks down its protective layer.
Furthermore, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60% by volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people do not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (in one minute exposure to disinfectant for stainless steel surface), including ethanol 6271%, isopropanol 50100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.27.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed COVID case in a public facility, such as an office or child care center, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the patient, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with curved elbows or use a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and then dispose of the tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and range of exhalation droplets that are dispersed when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch the face with unsanitary hands, which is a major source of transmission". Masks are also recommended for people who care for others who may have the disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as people caring for COVID-19 patients, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by members of the public.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical face masks made of fabric. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to healthy communities, especially when in close proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) to others.
Hong Kong recommends the wearing of surgical masks when using public transportation or staying in public places.
The Thai Health Office encourages people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit their citizens from going out in public without wearing masks or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks when going out in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone entering the barracks to wear a face mask.
Israel asks all its citizens to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, requires passengers on intercity trains and buses to wear face masks as of April 1.
Panama mandates the use of face masks whenever outdoors, and recommends the manufacture of homemade face masks for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restriction (also called physical restriction) is an infection control measure intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods of social restriction include quarantines; travel restrictions; as well as the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can implement methods of social restraint by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding public areas, using non-contact greetings, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Currently, many governments are imposing or calling for social restrictions in affected areas.
The maximum number of people to gather recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced, from 250 people (if no COVID-19 distribution was known in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings in public areas involving more than two people. The elderly and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and impaired immune systems who are at higher risk of serious illness and complications are advised by the CDC to stay as much as possible at home in areas with community-level outbreaks.
The use of the term "social restraint" implies that people should isolate themselves completely socially and not encourage people to stay in contact with others through alternative means.
These recommendations include encouragement to have sex only with people who live with you and do not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions are issued for people who belong to high-risk groups.
People who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to countries or regions with widespread spread of COVID-19 are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
The strategy in epidemic management is containment or suppression, as well as mitigation.
Containment is carried out at the early stages of an outbreak and is aimed at tracking and isolating infected people as well as undertaking other measures for infection control and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of disease, further efforts turn to the level of mitigation: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health care systems and communities.
The combination of containment and mitigation measures may be carried out simultaneously.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproduction rate to less than 1. Part of managing an outbreak of communicable disease is trying to lower the peak of the epidemic, known as bending the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overwhelming health care and gives more time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to address the epidemic include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community-level measures aimed at physical restriction, such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as measures at the environmental level, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also implemented various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass filtering and local quarantines, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support to infected people who self-quarantine and imposes heavy fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and penalized the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations for the UK and the United States show that mitigation (slowing, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the growth of the epidemic) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce peak health care demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelming health systems.
Suppression is selective, but must be maintained as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this is first achieved), as otherwise transmission will bounce back rapidly as suppression measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic have had social and economic impacts.
No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, which include testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter flu medications, drinking enough water, and resting may help to alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and respiratory support may be needed.
Steroid use can worsen the patient's condition.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO said that increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a key step in the response to the outbreak.
ECDC and WHO regional office Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to shift resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible canceling elective procedures, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, as well as increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the novel coronavirus can be traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has gradually increased.
The cases are mostly associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus originated from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for issuing warnings.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public announcement on December 31 and informed the WHO.
A fair number of unidentified cases of pneumonia were reported to the health authorities in Wuhan which subsequently triggered an investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migration during the Lunar New Year and as Wuhan is a major transportation hub and rail transit point.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data showed that 6,174 people had developed symptoms on 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area restrict free movement and establish border controls.
The national response included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-at-place orders, or provincial quarantines) and overnight curfews. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were in some form of provincial quarantine in the United States, more than 50 million people were in provincial quarantine in the Philippines, about 59 million people were in provincial quarantine in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were in provincial quarantine in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some sort of regional quarantine, which rose to 2.6 billion people two days later, or about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed COVID-19 case can be traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates the earliest case was on 17 November.
Zhang Jixian's doctor observed a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown cause on December 26; this observation was reported by his hospital to Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Preliminary genetic testing of a patient sample on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
The public announcement was released by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was notified the same day.
When this notice was issued, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by Communist Party of China general secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
In a quarantine described as the "biggest quarantine in human history", the cordon sanitaire was announced on 23 January to stop travel in and out of Wuhan, and was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
The Lunar New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.

A CNN report said that what contributed to the high fatality rate was a combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test all those infected with the virus.
Initially, the United Kingdom's response to the virus was one of the most lax among the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government has not imposed any social restrictions or mass quarantines on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received criticism for being perceived as being unresponsive and ineffective in responding to public concerns.

Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concerns about the quality of Chinese-made masks and testing equipment.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus test kits with an accuracy rate of only 30%; meanwhile, the Netherlands withdrew 600,000 defective Chinese-made face masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable masks, allegedly from China, but actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched an emergency support operation for developing countries.
WHO praised the Chinese government's efforts in managing and containing the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak when Chinese authorities were accused of covering up to hamper prevention and containment efforts and the current crisis with the central government "giving routine updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday".
On 23 January, in reaction to the central government's decision to impose a transport ban on Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that although the measure "is clearly not a WHO recommendation", it is also a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where the outbreak is most concentrated" and called it "unprecedented in the history of public health".On 30 January, following confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak a World Public Health Emergency Confirming (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first implemented during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was indicated because of the "risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries that do not have adequate health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to impose measures that unnecessarily disrupt international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO urged the global community to contribute $675 million that will be used to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency to support countries that "do not have systems to detect people infected with the virus if an outbreak spreads".
Further, Tedros made the statement that "the limits of our power are at the weakest point of the chain" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later". At a press conference on February 11, WHO designated COVID-19 as the name of the disease for the virus.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary General António Guterres had agreed to provide "a response in the form of the handing over of the entire power of the UN system".
The UN then activated the Crisis Management Team to enable coordination of the entire UN response, which according to WHO would allow them to "focus on the health response, while other agencies can use their membership to address the impact of the epidemic in the social, economic, and wider developmental spheres".
On 14 February, a joint Chinese Mission Team led by WHO was activated; this team aims to provide international and WHO experts in China in order to assist domestic management and to evaluate "the severity and transmission of the disease" by holding workshops and meetings with relevant national level bodies and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of the response activities at the provincial and county level, covering urban and rural settings".On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for the possible coronavirus pandemic" and said that, although it is too early to call it a pandemic, countries should remain in its "prepared phase".
In response to the growing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would be raised from "high" to "very high", this being the highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergency program, warned that, "It's time for every ruler on the planet to face reality: Wake up.
The virus may be coming to you and you should be prepared", and urged that the right response measures can help the world avoid "the worst".
Further, Ryan stated that current data does not allow public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, adding that such a declaration means "we basically accept that every human on the planet will be exposed to the virus".
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General said that WHO was "deeply concerned at the alarming rate of spread and severity, as well as the alarming rate of slow response".The WHO received sharp criticism for its assessments of inadequacy in dealing with the pandemic, which included delays in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
One of the harsh reactions included a petition signed by 733,000 people on April 6, addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to request his resignation.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed respect for the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group stated that everyone has the right to life-saving intervention and that the government bears responsibility for this.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance cannot be used as justification to discriminate against certain groups.
Members underlined that every individual has a right to health, including people with disabilities, minority groups, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, people living in extreme poverty, people in prison, refugees, and other groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are working to address the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a programme to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, along with views and suggestions.
From policies to strengthen the world's health and economic systems to overcoming the impact of regional quarantines and travel restrictions, the digital hubs include the Country Policy Trackers, and aim to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response in facing the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has received criticism from the United States, United Kingdom Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro, for its handling of the pandemic that began in China's Hubei province.
A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed in connection with the handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, which is a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of the political establishment in dealing with the epidemic in the province.
Some commentators believe that the move is meant to protect Communist Party of China general secretary Xi Jinping from the public outcry over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected previous admissions of a coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
US President Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "China's covert actions are giving strength to the virus that is now turning into a global pandemic". This statement was eventually criticized by a number of critics as racism and "distracted attention from his administration's failure to address the coronavirus".
The Daily Beast obtained a US government message outlining the communications strategy and clearly originated at the National Security Council, with the strategy cited as "All about China.
We were told to try and convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and appearances on television". Media outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claim that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda drive to influence the world.
The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is a "geo-political component, which includes the battle for influence through fact-finding and 'politics of generosity.'"
Borrell also said that, "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the US, they are a responsible and reliable partner".
China also called for the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, and reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid intended for other countries into their own countries.
There have also been reported mask-related disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey took hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity".
On 22 March, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin deployed Russian troops to send military medical personnel, specialized disinfecting vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid "is useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of carrying out a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm attack.
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering assistance to colleagues in the US, [Putin] assumed that if US medical equipment and materials manufacturers were given the opportunity, they would also be able to respond if necessary".
The NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" planned in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, the exercise not only endangers the lives of US troops and many participating European countries, but also the population of the countries where they operate".The Iranian government has been hit particularly hard by the virus, with around two dozen MPs infected along with fifteen current or former political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and said that his country was struggling to fight the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions on Iran.
Political analysts suspect that it could negatively impact Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at government-designated locations.
Initially, the public opinion in South Korea was divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions, both calling for Moon's impeachment, based on their claims of government failure in handling the outbreak, and praising his response.
Some commentators expressed concern that it could allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and general elections, and punish those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for cases of supply shortages, stemming from the increased global use of equipment to fight the epidemic, panic purchases, and disruptions to plant and logistics operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Some districts also experienced panic buying which resulted in shortages of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, which triggered shortages of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of delays in electronic shipments.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and triggered a four to six month delay in the supply of medical supplies.
This also leads to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warns that this will be a health hazard.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products within China.
This activity resulted in a shortage of formula milk in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and Wuhan province, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas were spared from food shortages.
Measures by China and Italy in combating the illegal accumulation and trade of essential products were successful so that the acute food shortages anticipated in Europe and North America could be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its large-scale agricultural production, has not experienced a significant decline, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were only temporarily found, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government offices released recommendations for pork to ensure the nutritional sufficiency of the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, which require food manufacturers to keep a reserve for emergencies like this.
The global economic downturn has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to contain the spread of the virus, and retail sales plunged by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub, the virus outbreak is considered to pose a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the market will remain volatile until there is a clearer picture of the potential end result.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of the economic downturn caused by the epidemic on global growth could surpass the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate from experts at Washington University in St. Louis says the pandemic has impacted more than $300 billion on the world's supply chain, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reported "races" after crude prices fell sharply due to reduced demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets plunged due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, amid rising concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indexes, which include the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded their sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007-2008.

The central banks reacted faster than they did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, closures of public places including tourist attractions, and government actions restricting travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the shipping industry is at an unprecedented level.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Lunar New Year holiday.
A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by the central and provincial governments, including the annual Lunar New Year festival, and private enterprises also independently closed shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions are closed to prevent mass gatherings, including Beijing's Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong stepped up infectious disease control to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March, and canceled New Year celebrations.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers have fallen by 50 to 60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping center operators around the world are implementing additional measures, such as increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase by between 14 and 22 million people compared to the situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
The majority of China's 300 million rural migrant workers are displaced at home in the interior provinces or trapped in Hubei province.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. Provincial quarantines in India caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages) to be unemployed. A survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of households in Canada experienced some form of job loss.
During the second half of March, a total of 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit schemes.
The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Britain.
Worldwide, the performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been severely impacted by the pandemic, which has affected the operations of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and self-employed.
Arts and cultural sector organizations strive to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission of providing access to cultural heritage to the community, maintaining the safety of employees and the community, and supporting artists where possible.
As of March 2020, worldwide and at varying levels, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions are closed indefinitely, with exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other adverse effects of the new and rapidly growing disease are the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry was also disrupted. The Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebration in Rome, which falls on the last week of the season of Christian Lent, was cancelled.
Many dioceses organize Christian seniors to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services via radio, live online broadcasting or television, while others offer drive-in or orthodox worship.
With the closure of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese and the evacuation of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and restricted public gatherings at churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and the subsequent closure of places of worship, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and its residents to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant disruption to the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The pandemic disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but no later than summer 2021". Worldwide, casinos and other gaming venues were closed and live broadcasts of poker tournaments were delayed or cancelled.
This has led to many gamblers moving to online gambling, many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new registrations. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various bands postponing or cancelling concert tours.
Many big theaters like Broadway also postponed all shows.
Artists explore various ways to continue producing and sharing works via the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as online live concert broadcasts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their work.
Many coronavirus-themed internet memes are circulated online with many people turning to humor and distraction amidst the uncertainty.
Since the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as towards people from affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) recorded racist sentiment expressed in groups around the world that the Chinese deserve to receive the virus or accept what they claimed was a fair reward.
Some countries in Africa have also seen a rise in anti-China sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their regional origin.
There's already support for the Chinese, both online and offline, and for people in the affected areas.
Following the spread of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is trending on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States report increasing levels of racist harassment and assault.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus", a term that critics consider racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students originating from Northeast India, which borders China, and studying in major Indian cities have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Bharatiya Janata Party state unit president in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "that is why God is avenging them".
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "misguided". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Tionghoa residents has flared up due to the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign trash" and targeted for "disposal".
Many newspapers that use paid-for blocking have removed it for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make scientific papers related to epidemics available in open access.
Some scientists choose to share their results quickly on a printable server, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA alone.
This test is used to confirm new or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for diagnosis and surveillance of the population.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have been infected, including people whose symptoms are too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
Accurate disease mortality figures and the level of cluster immunity in the population can be determined from the results of these tests.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was considerable variation in the number of tests that countries had done.
This variability may also significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed on a throat swab are reliable only in the first week of illness.
Eventually, the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for infected people tested in the second week, sample material can be taken from the deep airway using a suction catheter or material removed through coughing (sputum) can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed at Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and constituted at least 250,000 test kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed testing on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinically valid PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tool (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
The device searches for the "E" gene that all beta coronavirus possess, and the RdRp gene that is specific for SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first enterprises to receive emergency use approval from the China National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tool.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One out of three genetic tests in the older version of the test kit gave unconvincing results due to reagent errors, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was considered unreliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that state and local laboratories were allowed to conduct testing.
The test was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing nationally.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantity limits were announced; collection and processing of specimens must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for testing that can be done in 3.5 hours with high volumes so that one machine can perform about 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for testing that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing using non-PCR isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology.
Since no series of temperature change cycles are required, this method can give a positive result in as little as five minutes and a negative result in as little as 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipates increasing production to produce 50,000 tests per day. A test using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the nucleocapsid protein (protein N) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid influenza test.
A review of the literature published in March 2020 concluded that "thoracic imaging has little diagnostic value at an early stage, as CT [computed tomography] findings may be present before symptom onset".
Special features of CT include bilateral multilobal ground-glass optical bands with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distributions.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation form as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the current pandemic onset showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19".In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for early screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals from about 7 days after onset of symptoms, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance.
High-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this testing, but their availability will depend on the production level for each system.
For CLT, one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although a series of specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, a peripheral blood sample obtained through a skin puncture is generally used.
Unlike PCR methods, extraction steps are not required prior to screening.As of March 26, 2020, the FDA cited 29 agencies providing notification to the agency as needed and therefore now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA based on emergency use authorization.
It has the capacity to test up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so it's much faster than conventional PCR tests for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits it purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong devised a scheme to allow suspected patients to stay at home, "the emergency department would give the patient a specimen tube", they spit in it, send it back, and get the test results seconds later. NHS UK announced that the NHS is pioneering a suspected case testing scheme at home so that patients eliminate the risk of infecting others if they come to hospital or have to disinfect the ambulance if used.
The land-based testing centre has helped South Korea perform the fastest and most extensive testing of any country. On 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians of Germany said that Germany had a capacity of around 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient setting and 10,700 tests had been carried out in the previous week.
The cost is covered by the health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, a land test was offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests performed in Germany is unknown as only positive results have been reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples were tested up to and including week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only testing further if the combined samples were found to be positive.
With construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling showed that cases in Hubei could be 47% higher and the associated costs for quarantine handling could double if this testing capacity was not available.
Wuhan laboratories were soon followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, its total daily capacity is 50,000 tests per day. The open-source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. This balanced design can be performed in small laboratories without the need for robotic fluid handling.
Until March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents had been a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
As such, a number of researchers are working to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, the United Arab Emirates reportedly performed more coronavirus testing per capita population than any other country, and is poised to scale up testing to reach a larger majority of the population.
This was achieved through a combination of randomized testing and the purchase of mass-scale population-scale laboratory results from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of China.
Various test prescriptions targeting various parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German recipe for the production of test kits that were sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop them themselves.
The German prescription was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January so slowed down testing available in the US. At the beginning of the outbreak, China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits; these two countries and Australia were unable to provide enough test kits to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built up in a few years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for an increase in the testing program as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has left hundreds of thousands of tests pending in private US laboratories, and the preparation of aspirators and chemical reagents has become critical.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of their test equipment.
In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government later removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing by the private sector. Spain purchased the test kit from Chinese enterprise Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or use the test equipment correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would withdraw equipment that gave incorrect results, and replace it with other test kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits the Czech Republic purchased from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China which turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that the test kit be dumped into the Danube river. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test kit Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and they were not "using it".The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that the test kit could not be used.
Testing, followed by quarantine of people who tested positive and tracking of people who came into contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, gave a positive end result.
Researchers working in the town of Vò Italia, the site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing across a population of 3,400 people, about 10 days apart.
About half of the people who test positive have no symptoms, and all the cases found are quarantined.
With restrictions on travel to this community, new infections are being eliminated altogether.
With aggressive contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantines, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is developing much more slowly than in other developed countries despite no extreme restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened in time after the holiday on 23 March.
Some other countries also tackled the pandemic with aggressive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantines, but with less aggressive regional quarantines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had much lower case fatality rates, possibly because these countries were better able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommended that countries that do not have testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five COVID-19 positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America, and one in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "% of test positive results" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
Countries that only tested people who were hospitalized would have a higher percentage of positive results than countries that tested all of their population, whether they showed symptoms or not, by other factors of the same magnitude.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands in order to remove dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People can also contract respiratory diseases, such as influenza or the common cold, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical times of the day for hand washing with soap are: before and after defecating, after cleaning a child's ass or changing a diaper, before bathing a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, wash your hands with ash.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after treating the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning a kid who just used the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal feces.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of handwashing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And reduce the infant mortality rate in home births.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that increased hand-washing practices may slightly improve toddler height growth.
In developing countries, child mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from the disease by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in cases of diarrhea can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ASTI), as subconscious behaviors are practiced in homes, schools, and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, which is a major ISPA, is the number one cause of infant death; it causes the deaths of about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making hand-washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet a routine could save more lives than any vaccine or medical measure, as well as cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation measures as part of a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo that is spread through direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause an itchy and scaly skin condition, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly prevalent among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day when hand washing with soap is essential to reduce the transmission of disease by fecal-oral means, namely: before and after using the toilet (toilet, bowel movement), after cleaning a child's ass (changing diapers), before bathing a child, before eating and before/after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other important times to apply proper handwashing techniques to prevent the spread of disease are before and after treating wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the level of handwashing with soap is still low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practiced handwashing with soap.[citation needed] A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 percent; the United States was near the middle at 77 percent; and China was at the lowest rate at 23 percent.[citation needed] Several behavioral modification methodologies are now available to increase the adoption of handwashing habits at critical moments.[citation needed] Group handwashing for students at set times is one option in developing countries to introduce handwashing in children's behavior.[citation needed]
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a scale-up of action to support children's health and education.
The administration of worm spray twice a year, coupled with daily hand washing with soap and daily fluoridation of the teeth, is at the heart of this national program.
The program has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Cleansing of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by the addition of soap or detergent to the water.
The main job of soap and detergents is to reduce the barrier to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic waste, are not easily soluble in water.
Nevertheless, the cleansing of fats and proteins is aided by sufficient water flow.
Solid soap, due to its recyclable nature, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies investigating bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap concluded that transfer is unlikely because bacteria are lax with foam.
Still, the CDC says "liquid soaps that are extracted from containers without touching hands are preferred".
Antibacterial soap is widely promoted in health-conscious communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants is better for organisms resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
So even though antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soaps, these soaps may not be as effective as those marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective agents, sophisticated formulations can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioners (crocodile glands, vitamins, bulbs, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that regular soap is as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing disease and cleaning bacteria from hands.
The warm water that's comfortable for hand washing isn't hot enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria grow more rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils that retain dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol-based hand sanitizer (also called alcohol-based hand sanitizer, antiseptic hand sanitizer, or hand sanitizer) began to be introduced.
Most of these cleaning agents are alcohol- or ethanol-based isopropyls formulated together with a thickener such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into a gel or together with a humicant such as glycerin into a liquid or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity further. Hand sanitizer containing at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficient germicide.
Rubbing alcohol disinfection kills bacteria, including multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
70% alcohol-containing sanitization kills 99.97% (log reduction 3.5, similar to reduction 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log reduction 4 to 5) of bacteria in the hand 1 minute after use.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type virus, the most common cause for infectious gastroenteritis.
The front and back of the hands and the sides and ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed by rubbing them on both palms.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizing, especially when hands look dirty.
The increased use of sanitizing agents is due to ease of use and rapid killing activity of microorganisms; however, sanitizing agents should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing, unless soap and water are not available.
The use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can frequently cause dry skin, unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps and detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives in alcohol-based hand scrubs are rare.
The lower incidence of causing contact dermatitis that is disruptive to the appeal of this product compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Although effective, the non-water agent does not clean the hands of organic matter, but only disinfects them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogens are still on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and historically, these products performed significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol scrubbers.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side-effect reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, if it comes into contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as alternatives to soap when soap is not available.
Proper handwashing techniques based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommendations for disease prevention include the following measures:
Wash your hands with hot or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because the boiling basin may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not seem to have an effect.
Wipe your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hand, the fingertips, and the fingernails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly with soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer eliminates more germs.
Wash thoroughly under running water.
Washing in a basin can re-contaminate the hands.
Dry with a dry cloth or let air dry.
Wet, damp hands are more likely to re-infect, and the areas that are often missed are the thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers, and the under nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can store microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to keep hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing when tap water and/or soap are not available, for example, draining water from suspended and sealed syringes or bottles and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural districts in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-tap", as well as other low-cost options.
A tippy tap is a simple technology that uses a water bottle suspended by a rope, a lever operated by the foot to pour a little water into the hand, and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
A growing number of studies show that paper towels are much cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper folding industry's European Tissue Symposium, to compare the cleanliness levels of paper folding, warm air hand dryers, and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased by an average of 194% in the fingerbooks and 254% in the palm.
Drying with a jet air dryer causes an average increase in the total number of bacteria 42% in the fingertips and 15% in the palm.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% in the fingerbooks and 77% in the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the potential for cross-contamination in other toilet users and toilet environments due to each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which exhausted air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and unit and potentially contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment to a distance of 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
The paper lab did not show significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following changes in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper-based dryers.
Hand washing using hand sanitizer is an alternative during travel if soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing was mandated long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospital environments.
There's an electronic device that provides feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with the use of such devices.
Medical handwashing is performed for a minimum of 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or a gel to coat and rub each part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed together with interlocking fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, a hairbrush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in the water on the hands, they should be washed thoroughly and dried with a clean cloth.
After drying, a paper sheet is used to turn off the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This avoids the recontamination of the hands from the surface.
The purpose of hand washing in health care settings is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("worms") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing is still at an unacceptable level in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients so that microorganisms are transmitted.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by up to 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a paper showing the standard of hand washing and hand rubbing in the healthcare sector.
WHO's hand hygiene concept guidelines can also be viewed on its website for public comment.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of compliance with the regulations is required.
The World Health Organization has a "Five Hours" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood/body fluids
before aseptic duties, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (soap "medicine" or "antimicrobial") works to kill hand washing agents.
Such a killing function may be desirable before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are particularly common. To 'rub' hands before surgery, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching, a chlorhexidine or iodine washer, a sterile cloth to dry hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub and other sterile instruments to clean the nail beds are required.
All jewelry must be removed.
The procedure requires washing the hands and forearms to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
Long scrubbing time (10 minutes) is not required.
When rinsing, the water in the lower arm should be prevented from flowing back to the hand.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and surgical cloak is applied.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash or sanitize hands before and after handling a sick person.
For the management of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands came from the first 20% of washing, and that the additional benefit was very small when the frequency of hand washing was increased above 35%.
Washing with regular soap results in more than three times the transmission of infectious diseases to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. A comparison between hand-wringing with an alcohol-based solution and hand-wringing with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds each shows that alcohol-based hand-wringing reduces bacterial contamination 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand scrubs in reducing the influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands.Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings can include education for staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand scrubs, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine the most effective interventions across a variety of health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a basic, cost-effective way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap, or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes the goal of achieving universal hand-washing behaviour a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand washing faucets near private or public toilets are rare, although there are options for making hand washing places affordable.
However, low levels of handwashing may also be due to an ingrained habit rather than a lack of soap or water.
Encouragement and encouragement of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and result in long-term population behavioural change.
To run effectively, supervision and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns were less effective.[citation needed] One example of handwashing in schools was the "Three-Star Approach" by UNICEF which encouraged schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
Once the minimum standards are met, the school can go from one star to eventually three stars.
Building handwashing facilities could be part of a handwashing campaign to reduce childhood disease and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that tries to achieve the goal of behavioural change.
Several studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or measures of years lost to illness.
One study showed that promoting hand washing with soap was significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing" in England.
At the time, many still believed that infection was caused by a foul odor called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, an outbreak of food-borne and healthcare-associated infections made the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from the contagious disease.
For example, "correct handwashing techniques" posters are hung next to handwashing sinks in public toilets as well as in office buildings and airport toilets in Germany.
The expression "wash your hands of" something means to express a person's refusal to take responsibility for something or to participate in something.
The phrase originated in the biblical passage in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a widely used phrase in the English community.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands continuously to clean up the imaginary stain; an act that shows her guilt for the crime she committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been found that, after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate handwashing devices more.
Furthermore, people who were allowed to wash their hands after the meditation were less likely to engage in compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
The religion commands hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual washing of hands in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing before and after eating.
Workplace hazard management for COVID-19
Workplace hazard management for COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health methodology for hazard management for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper hazard management in the workplace depends on the workplace and the job assignment, which is based on an assessment of the risk of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the individual risk factors of the workers who may be susceptible to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers; for these jobs, basic infection prevention measures are recommended, which include hand washing, encouraging employees to stay in hospital if necessary, respiratory ethics, and performing routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Current exposure risk occupations include occupations that require close or frequent contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, work environments with high population density, and high volume retail orders.
Hazard management for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high efficiency air filters, protection against sneezing, and provision of personal protective equipment when in contact with COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers health personnel and morgues exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if the employee performs an aerosol-producing procedure on, or takes or handles specimens from, a person known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Suitable hazard management for these workers includes technical management, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job task.
The COVID-19 pandemic may have some impact on the workplace.
Employees may not show up for work because they are sick, need to care for others, or are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of the type of goods demanded and the way these goods are procured (such as spending outside rush hours, through shipping, or on-line).
Finally, shipments from geographic regions that are highly affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted.
The plan considers the level of risk associated with the various workplaces and job duties, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the household and community, as well as individual risk factors of the employee, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the management needed to address such risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and management plans for communicable diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The objectives of epidemic control include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk for adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the response measures taken.
A hazard management hierarchy is a widely used framework in occupational safety and health to classify hazard management based on its effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective management is technical management, followed by administrative management, and lastly, self-protective gear.
Technical control involves isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in work policies or procedures that requires action by the employee or employer.
Self-protective devices (SPCs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of APD should be selected based on the hazard to workers, properly installed as appropriate (e.g. respirators), applied consistently and correctly, inspected, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal work contact with the public and other coworkers.
The recommended policy infection prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, respiratory ethics include covering up coughs and sneezing, providing tissue and trash containers, preparing for remote work or shift work with gradual arrival/return times, if necessary, informing workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and conducting routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever medication or other symptom-modifying medications, and that sick leave policies be flexible to allow employees to stay home to care for sick family members, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, occupations at high risk of exposure currently include occupations that require close or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with a person who is not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in the community around the location of the business, or because a person has recently traveled internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
Administrative controls for these groups and high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home with masks, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, making work shifts with a gradual curfew/return, stopping nonessential travel to private environments where COVID-19 is being epidemic, developing emergency forum communication plans to respond to worker concerns, supplementing workers with up-to-date education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behavior, training them to use protective clothing and equipment, providing supportive and hygienic resources and allowing regular access to customers, putting on face masks, putting on at least a combination of face and hand protective masks, wearing face coverings, or wearing a mask.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If someone falls ill on an airplane, the appropriate controls to protect other staff and passengers include separating the sick person from others by six feet, assigning a cabin crew member to care for the sick person, and offering a face mask for the sick person or asking them to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze.
You should wear disposable medical gloves when treating sick passengers or when touching bodily fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly other personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in biohazard bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard management includes delaying travel if sick, self-isolation, and informing the on-board medical center immediately if a person develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is done in isolation cabins. Apart from spread in the community, for schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if an infected person has ever been in a school building.
If there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social restriction strategies can be implemented, which include: cancelling field visits, gatherings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or dining in cafeterias, increasing table-to-table distance, gradual arrival and return times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high prevalence in the local community, in addition to social containment strategies, extending school closures may be considered. For law enforcement officers who engage in routine daily activities, the direct health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must make contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 persons are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during the arrest, the worker should clean and disinfect the belt and duty equipment before reuse using a household spray or cleaner cloth and follow standard operating procedures for handling and disposal of container APDs as well as for handling and washing dirty clothes.
OSHA considers certain health personnel and morgues to be in the high or very high exposure risk category.
High-risk exposures include health care provision, support, laboratory, and medical transportation personnel exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This work becomes extremely high risk of exposure if the worker performs aerosol-generating procedures on, or takes or handles specimens from, a known or suspected COVID-19 patient.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, several procedures and dental examinations, or invasive specimen collection.
High-risk morgue work includes workers involved in preparing the remains of people with known or suspected COVID-19 cases at the time of death; this work becomes extremely high-risk if the worker performs an autopsy.
Specific negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
Specimens shall be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into separate waiting rooms based on whether they are suspected of COVID-19 cases. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people working within 6 feet of patients known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and people performing aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filter mask respirators or better should be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes suitability testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and enhance worker comfort. WHO does not recommend full-face or coveralls as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening personnel at entry points.
For people who are collecting respiratory samples, treating, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective goggles, or face shields, cloaks, and gloves.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, surgical masks are replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Given that the supply of APDs is inadequate worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for APDs through remote medical services, physical restrictions such as transparent windows, with only people involved in direct care being able to enter the room containing COVID-19 patients, using only the APDs needed for specific tasks, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it while treating multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for people without symptoms.

Subject: [COVID-19] Easing the burden and preparing for the future
The following is a list of all known incidents of human trafficking in the United States.
CC0 No rights reserved
We find ourselves in an unusual situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a clear indication of the global human connection and the responsibility we have for each other.
We've never faced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the development of the global community, which is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we've seen among all of our colleagues through emails, calls, and chats is an incredible validation of the extraordinary people we've been fortunate enough to work with.
My gratitude and pride are beyond words to call you all my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how important it is for the world today to have access to Wikipedia and how it is a powerful symbol of this vital resource to keep it available online for everyone.
Your job is to make this happen, whether you keep this site running, help pay our associates, or help keep our community safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, especially now.
This is a moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're making some important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to maintain the organization's continuity over time.
We're very keen to relieve the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to cut back on your work schedule, that's fine.
To all staff, contractors, and contractors:
Our daily work expectation is about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a day off, so if you can work more during normal hours, this mission needs you.
Yet, the world is unpredictable today, and whether you need to care for a loved one, spend groceries, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't monitor your work hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have to be said, but we did.
No sick leave or PTO is necessary, just let your manager know and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure key areas of work are completed.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please let Bryan know within T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets proper attention from management.)
Associates who are paid by the hour will be paid in full.
We've said it, and we'll say it again, to honor our commitment to our contractor and our hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid according to their normal hours of work under normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we're behind you.
Many people use work as a way to channel stress into the world around us.
The work we do can be very rewarding, especially at times like these.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to be done.
SRE, HR, Trust & Security Operations, and Fundraising teams, among others, are doing important work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what is essential to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't do any good for the future.
We don't plan on "working overtime to catch up" after the pandemic is over.
You would not be expected to work overtime to meet today's unrealistic deadlines.
We are aware that the situation is changing and will be able to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the APP?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intent is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to budget so employees can prioritize essential work, self-care, and caring for loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work with fewer schedules over the next few weeks.
Extending this timeline greatly reduces the workload and the current planning stress across the organization.
We'll present our proposal to the House next week and update the delegation and team on the next step as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, exposure, and cleaning of the office
Last week, we were informed that one of our colleagues based in SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of concern, we hired an anti-virus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They're using hospital-grade antiviral fluid to disinfect every surface, lobby, and every elevator that accesses our floor.
The building enforces its own safety assurance protocols by using products that support the occupant's safety.
We're happy that the office will be ready for use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff members.
As of last week, our D.C. office has moved to full remote working mode, in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we're also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time colleagues who work remotely realize that it may need adjustments and they would like to give you a suggestion:
Limit the duration of the encounter to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider dividing them into several days.
Define clearly, make an agenda, and send in prior reading material.
Make video the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connections.
Appoint a leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the chat for queries and to record the speaker list, and someone to help make close notes (or do collaborative note-making).
Email technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy small meals.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about shared jobs
The HR Operations Team is looking for webinar-based ergonomics guidelines to support increased work that is distributed across the Foundation.
In recent weeks we've asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as the Edit-a-thon, until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We informed them that we understand our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to complete the approved grant activities and that no one would be penalized for having to delay or modify the target.
Next week we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, the sentiment from the entire global community seems to be one of sadness over the disruption, but also of relief over the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Going forward, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Stay connected during COVID-19 situation
We'll be sending you an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential COVID-19-related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep this page updated and ensure all information is in one place.
We are also able to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, key workflows, or difficulties with coverage, or anything else that may require assistance, please feel free to let us know and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and be a liaison as needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive concerns, please email Bryan Judan, Global Operations Director of SDM International.
None of these changes should be seen as a neglect of our duty and duty.
Instead, it is a recognition that, at present, our jobs and responsibilities may need to be adapted in ways we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are essential to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support our movement needs, and provide the world with the services they rely on.
The work we planned will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for the important work that's coming in the weeks and maybe months ahead.
We need all of you to make it happen, and for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work your best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has activity opposite angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an M2 domain of N-terminal peptidase and a renal amino acid transporter domain of collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, with an enzymatically active domain exposed on the cell surface in the lung and other tissues.
The extracellular ACE2 domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 attaches to cell membranes especially type II alveolar lung cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin II by vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cleaves the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for several coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 protein on the spike or bulge of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endosytosis and the translocation of the virus and enzyme into the endosomes located within the cell.
This process of viral entry also requires the priming of protein S by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact leads to the hypothesis that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing therapy with standard ACE inhibitors and ARBs.
A systematic review and meta-analysis, published on 11 July 2012, found that "use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Furthermore, "the use of ACE inhibitors also decreases the risk of pneumonia in patients who are at higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipoplysaccharide-induced acute respiratory syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours with a 30-minute onset of action plus a 24-hour duration of effect.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases with increased angiotensin II in blood circulation.
b'COVID-19 App is a mobile software application designed to assist in contact tracing to address the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have come into contact with an infected person.
Many applications were developed or proposed, which gained official governmental support in several provinces and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for developing contact tracing applications have been developed.
Privacy concerns are questioned, especially in relation to systems based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
A less intrusive privacy alternative includes the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 patients.
It's used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, it's used in an app called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is still awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development and would be available for deployment in a few weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for diagnosed COVID-19 patients living in Moscow; the app is designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that could arise with an application-based system, including false positives and the possibility of ineffectiveness if the data the application collects is limited to a small fraction of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, limiting them to "official" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates voiced their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued statements calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
The organization stated eight conditions for the government project:
the surveillance must be 'legal, necessary and proportionate';
the extension of monitoring and surveillance shall have a sunset clause;
data use should be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of data must be protected and demonstrated to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid the exacerbation of discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in law;
there should be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation means all "relevant stakeholders" are needed, including public health professionals and marginalized groups.
The proposed Google/Apple plan is intended to address the problem of continuous surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from the device's operating system once it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, rather than apps, thus eliminating the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have the potential for significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access private location data; a number of privacy-protecting systems have been created and use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, non-app-based systems are used to track contacts.
Instead of using specialized applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications via text message to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made the location information publicly available, which was allowed by the wide-ranging changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany are considering using centralized systems as well as systems that protect privacy.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been released.
Privacy-protecting contact tracking is an established concept, with a large body of research literature dating back to at least 2013.As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort containing a centralized and decentralized approach, rather than a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes Decentralized Privacy Protecting Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly called Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Tracking Cellular Contacts (PACT), etc.
In this protocol, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matches occur on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-protecting techniques while collecting and using location or flow intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology and was originally also set up at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and officers without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was established by groups that share a fundamentally similar approach and are multi-protocol overlapping, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and alerting applications, which is a key aspect to achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application open source.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that operate the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also published the core technology specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be launched in three stages:
launching a tool to enable governments to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address the problem of data capture and continuous surveillance by initially distributing the system through operating system updates, then removing it in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Drug repositioning (also called new purpose assignment, new profile, or new task on a drug or therapy shift) is the use of an approved drug for a new therapeutic purpose, i.e. for a disease or medical condition different from the original purpose of drug development.
This line is a scientific research track that is currently underway to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other areas of research include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug-target proteins, each of which has several ligand-binding sites.
Analysis of these ligand binding sites could form the basis of a project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteases, RNA-dependent polymerase, helikase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphatease.
Hussein A, et al investigated several candidate compounds which were then optimized and analyzed for structural similarity to the drugs that had been approved and had the highest similarity in order to accelerate the development of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in their preclinical studies to be recommended in the design of the clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydrochlorokuin were two of the four drugs to be investigated as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydrochlorquine in New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been determined.
The doctors said they took the drug when "there was no other option".
A team of Turkish researchers in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety and efficacy trial of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir proved "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of 4 days, while the duration of illness was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminds the public that the evidence available to support the drug is limited and premature.
On 2 April, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan for preparation and use the military to deliver the drug to a university hospital, where it will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump administration to buy the drug, which may be less effective in severe cases with the virus multiplying.
This medicine may not be safe if used by pregnant women or people trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), which is a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antiviral, concluded that no benefit was observed.
The drug is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find compounds that would bind to the protease SARS-CoV-2.There is criticism in the scientific community about the allocation of resources to position drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences discovered that Remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against several phyllo-, pneumo-, paramikso-, and coronavirus.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the emergence of resistance through mutation that can cause disease and more severe transmission.
Some early trial studies suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital, one for people with moderate disease and one for people with severe disease.
There are three ongoing clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized people with severe COVID-19 disease, namely two placebo-controlled (Tokyo, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of patients with a new coronavirus infection that is prysymptomatic.
For a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to see the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, named COLCORONA, enrolled 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not use effective contraception are not eligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients so much so that it prompted the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study in 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin at prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention is focused on giving new therapeutic targets to antiviral drugs approved and developed for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Several antibiotics have been identified as potential new targets for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (IL-6 anti-receptor): Approved by China.
Additionally, trials are also being conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, there are many efforts underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the disease, would not be available for less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major pandemic spread around the world in 2020, resulting in massive investment and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the published genome to develop a vaccine that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI Initiative issued a statement in April that the things to consider in developing vaccines are speed, production capacity, deployment at the scale needed, as well as global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main targets of the platform advanced to the Phase I security study, include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered to be in planning or being planned).
Phase I-II trials conduct preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually conducted randomly, placebo-controlled, and in multiple locations, while determining a more accurate effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including controls, and test the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring for side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines currently in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of them are not yet in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" studies).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating the potential of a molecular-clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
On 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that they had begun developing a vaccine, with a target of human testing in 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun developing a vaccine.
Janssen is working with his biotech partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine with technology similar to the technology used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and would begin testing.
On 27 February 2020, Generex subsidiary NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology announced they were starting a vaccine project to make a Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They want to produce a vaccine candidate that can be tested on humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical and Supply Research Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were partnering with Novavax Inc.
in vaccine development and manufacturing.
Further, the partnership announced the preclinical and Phase I clinical trial plans in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced they were working on 11 isolates, and even on the fast track, vaccine development would at least take around one and a half to two years.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered "a large sum of money" for exclusive access to Covid-19 vaccines to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company, BioNTech, to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently, the mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in preclinical trials with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced they would get preclinical trial results in April 2020 and a vaccine candidate that is in the final stages could begin human testing in the fall.
On 19 March 2020 in France, the Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Coalition (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with CEPI's total investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine reaching US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 medical research projects addressing COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian enterprises and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At roughly the same time, the Canadian government announced a C$192 million fund dedicated to developing a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, in mice; they stated that "MNA administering the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine elicited a potent antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] that began to be seen 2 weeks after immunization".
On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access the supercomputer from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have a heterologous effect, also called a nonspecific effect.
That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the diseases they prevent.
A further trace trial in Australia followed 4,170 health workers.
There is a possibility that the vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Early studies to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, suggest the need for containment measures to achieve biosecurity level 3 in dealing with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there is no proven safe and effective protective drug or vaccine for SARS in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
As MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS studies are believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that has completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two adenovirus-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts fueled conspiracy theories claiming the virus behind COVID-19 had been identified previously and that a vaccine was available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to symptom onset is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and complex organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. The virus is spread primarily between humans through close contact, often through splashes or tiny droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although produced during exhalation, the droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can survive for up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may occur before symptoms appear and after further stages of disease. The standard diagnostic method is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of being infected with the virus and people who are treating them.
Recommendations on the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend their use, and some require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or congestion, confusion, difficulty waking, and blueness of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, wheezing, or sore throat may be found, but are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially only had a clinical picture of chest tightness and palpitations.
In some people, the disease can progress to pneumonia, organ failure, and death.
This is called incubation.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms will develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not fully understood; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is unknown and is being investigated, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry a large-scale viral load.
Speaking out loud releases more sparkles or droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs can cause droplet pushes as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air, the United States National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission may occur and that air collectors placed in hallways outside people's rooms produce positive samples for the virus' RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary cardiac resuscitation (CPR), can cause respiratory secretions to be converted into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Although there is concern that the virus may spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for up to one day on cardboard/cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective when used correctly; soap products break down the protective fatty layer of the virus, deactivate the virus, and free it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), were less effective.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in naturally related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which damages its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the first SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organ by COVID-19 as the virus accesses host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike or bulge" (peplomer) to attach to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury is found in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe illness.
The high rate of cardiovascular symptoms is due to the presence of a systemic inflammatory response and disruption of the immune system during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in COVID-19 infection patients in ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were shown to correlate with inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocyte recruitment and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsies.
WHO has published several testing protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on a breath sample obtained through nasopharyngeal suction; however, nasal suction or sputum samples may also be used.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood testing can be used, but requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart until the results have little time value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate this strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (which can detect active infection and if a person has been infected previously) is in development, but has not been widely used.
Chinese experience with such tests shows accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on March 21, 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infection based on clinical picture and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distributions is widely found early in infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
Little data are available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at autopsy were:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, consolidation of the lungs, and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the formation of multi-celled giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the cured stage: exudate arrangement in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblast reactions
Precautions to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, frequently washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inner elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. Social restriction strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large numbers of people, by closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel, and cancelling large-scale gatherings in public places.
Restrictions also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected to be available until early 2021, a key part of tackling COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are dirty, before eating, and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Furthermore, the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not the active ingredient for hand antiseptics".
Glycerol is added as a humicant.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they carry the virus wear simple face masks.
Extraterrestrial membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to boost immunity.
Supportive treatment may be useful in people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for dealing with hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Intensive care and pulmonary doctors in the U.S. have compiled care recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical personnel prefer to recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first-line use.
Preventive measures should be taken to minimize the risk of viral transmission, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health personnel treating COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends placing the person in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions.
The recommended equipment is: APD cloak, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized these masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
N95 respirators are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not mentioned on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but some cases are severe.
A type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized people, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high-flow nasal cannula or bipositive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these methods produces the same benefits for critically ill people.
Some physicians prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, as this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of the health system to deal with the sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients end up in ICU.
Mechanical ventilation became more complicated as acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occurred in COVID-19 and oxygenation became increasingly difficult.
Ventilators capable of high pressure control and PEEP modes are needed to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung and pneumothoracic injury associated with ventilators.
High PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already in advanced trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on people with serious illnesses.
The FDA has granted provisional authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
Convalescent plasma has not undergone the clinical trials needed to prove its safety and efficacy for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to tackle the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is capable of detecting 'close contact' using surveillance data so it can detect potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also notifies local health officials. Data analytics on cell phone data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people who have come into contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of being infected with the coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who may have come into contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate telephone location data to the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
The Russians are using facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said it was told by mobile operators that "40% of the population is still on the move".
The German government is running a hackathon over the weekend with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People can be stressed by quarantines, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic downturn are perfect storms that are endangering mental health and public well-being".
The disease can be mild with little or no symptoms, which is similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while those suffering from severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are still lacking.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or complex organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clotting disorders, in particular increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while impaired renal function was seen in 4% of this cohort.
About 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 profile show elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between admission and death.
In a study that looked at early cases, the median time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromycoid exudate in both lungs.
Cytopathic viral changes are observed in the pneumocytes.
The pulmonary picture is similar to acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, cardiac damage was observed, with either increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people admitted to hospitals have a congenital condition.
Estimates of mortality from conditions vary due to regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The lack of a count of minor cases could lead to an overestimation of the death toll.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases that occurred in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is calculated too low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than nonsmokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections provided effective and long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is considered to be possible, if one looks at the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but there have been reports of a recovered case of COVID-19 followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days later.
This case is believed to be a worsening residual infection, not a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated from animals, through infection that spread.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infection is almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest onset of symptoms as December 1, 2019.
Official publications from WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, management options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death-to-case ratio reflects the total number of deaths divided by the total number of diagnosed cases over a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case-to-case mortality ratio was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a particular disease, and the infectious fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) had died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread through Carnival festivals, which spread among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and it is likely that not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German health system is not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of pandemics and mortality rates are different for men and women.
Mortality was higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the risk difference between men and women not being apparent by age 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for this gender-based difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences based on sex, lower smoking prevalence in women, and men having comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the US government does not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Studies show that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of female health workers, particularly nurses, is higher, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species, or group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatization.
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Both the common disease and the common virus are referred to as "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCov acute respiratory disease as provisional names for viruses and diseases in line with 2015 guidelines urging not to use location names in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print healthcare materials such as nasal swabs and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital was in desperate need of ventilator valves, and suppliers could not supply them on the required time scale, a local company re-engineered and printed 100 valves needed overnight.
Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to several other animals.
Studies found no evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no approved drug or vaccine to treat this disease.
International research into COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to study the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
A vaccine is not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoVs was used because SARS-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being studied.
First, researchers aim to create a complete virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, either inactivated or dead, is intended to rapidly trigger the human body's immune response to new COVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create vaccines that make the immune system sensitive to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on the S-spike protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccination (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new technique for making vaccinations).
Experimental vaccines made with these strategies are to be tested to determine their safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.
There are over 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Newly-designed antiviral drugs make up the bulk of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries with a reporting deadline of late April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates is already available. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which include remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
In March 2020, there was provisional evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China, and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was investigated in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for a peer review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that double doses are extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on the policy of doctors treating COVID-19 patients.The 7th edition Chinese guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. The study showed that early priming of the proton protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) was critical for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant limitations that have prevented the medical community from using these therapies without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of cytokine storm can occur in advanced severity COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antistatic properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
The drug is undergoing a phase 2 clinical trial at a national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, the drug is intended to combat cytokine storms, which are suspected of causing death in some affected people.
In 2017, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence to suggest that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer of purified and bound antibodies produced by the systems of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a method of passive non-vaccination immunization.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is the expected mechanism of action for passive antibody therapy to mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using produced monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
Production of convalescent serum, which is the liquid portion of the patient's recovered blood that contains specific antibodies to the virus, can be increased for faster use.
