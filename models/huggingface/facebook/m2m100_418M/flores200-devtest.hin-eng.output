Martelli has sworn yesterday in a new Unlimited Election Council (CEP) of nine members.
It is the fifth CEP of Martelli in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the CEP's previous resignation as part of the package of measures to move the country towards new elections.

About the Nexus system, the FAA claims that it will make it possible to fly the aircraft on small routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and also reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, which is contrary to old ground-radar-based technology, helping air traffic controllers run the aircraft with more accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation is being imposed and overground trains will not stop in Wembley, and car parking and park and ride facilities will not be available on the ground.
Fear of a lack of transportation increased the possibility that the sports team will be forced to play behind the closed door without supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the Journal of Science the creation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Island.
Researchers from the University of Princeton in the United States and the University of Osala in Sweden that the new species developed in just two generations, although it was said that this process took a lot of time due to the reproduction between a local Darwin Finch, Geospizza Fortes and Immigrant Cactus Finch, Geospizza Conirostris.
Gold can work in all kinds of shapes. it can be turned into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and swallowed. it can be beat or sheets can be made.
It can be made quite thin and placed on another metal. it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate handmade paintings in books called “Publicated Pandulpias”.
It is called the pH of the chemical. you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes colour depending on acidic or basic (coral) chemistry.
pH (pH) levels are formed on the basis of hydrogen (H) particles present in pH.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons removed them (because the hydrogen atom is made in combination with a proton and an electron).
Mix both dried spots together and then press with clean wet hands, in a ball.
The moisture of your hands will act with external layers, which will feel strange and create a kind of cover.
In the cities of Hadappa and Mohan-Joddo, almost every house had a flash toilet, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
In Greece, remains of Sweeze systems have been found in the Minuan Cities of Creté and Santorini houses.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. in the Roman civilization, toilets were part of bathrooms, which both men and women used together in the same group.
Thousands of miles away to call someone, you use the satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then reverses it down, at the same time.
Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere impurizes some of our light and vision.
A large rocket of more than 100 feet is needed to hold a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheels have changed the world in an extraordinary way.The greatest thing is that the wheels have done the job to give us easier and faster transportation.
It has given us train, car and many other means of transport.
Under them are more medium-sized cats who eat medium-sized cats from rabbits to dead and sharks.
Finally, there are many such small cats (including lush stomach cats) that eat many small creatures such as insects, rodents, scratches and birds.
Each cat has a special job that prevents him from competing with others.
The Lion Pride is the largest social cats living in large groups.
The group of lions consists of one to three adult men as well as more than thirty women and swords.
As sisters and daughters have a big family, the mothers are usually closely connected to each other.
The group of lions largely acts like wolves or dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but other big cats) in animal behavior, and are also very deadly for their hunting.
Like a fully developed athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump to large distances and pull with five times the strength of a powerful man.
Like tigers, tendons, and Jaguar, the lion also belongs to the same group (Genes Panthera).
A tiger's thunder is not like a thunder with a loud voice of a lion, but it's binding, as crying.
Osillates like to eat small animals. If they can catch, they will catch monkeys, serpents, and birds. Almost all the animals that are a victim of osillates are very smaller than them.
Scientists believe that oselots pursue animals by smell and are accounts (hunting), smelling where they will be on earth.
They can see very well in the darkness of the night, and can move very secretly. Oscillates turn around their surrounding area and then hunt their hunt by hunting their hunt.
When a small group of living things (small population) separates from the part of the main population from where they came from (such as if they came from a mountain chain or river or if they go to a new island so that they can’t easily retreat), they often find themselves in a different atmosphere.
This new place has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need to adopt different specialities or changes to become a strong competitor than the previous one.
There has not been any kind of change in the original population, still he wants the same adaptation as before.
With time, as the new population is shrinking into the new atmosphere, it also begins to ignore as the other population.
Finally, thousands or millions of years later, the two wings will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speculation, which means the formation of new species. speculation is a good step and is a very important part of development.
Plants produce oxygen that humans use to breathe and they take carbon dioxide that humans breathe (i.e. breathe).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. they also give shadow.
We make our houses of plants and we make clothes of plants.Most foods we eat are plants.Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasurus was the greatest hunter of his time, so he was not afraid of anyone other than Mosasurus.
With an extra set in his mouth, as well as more than 70 ranger, his long gums were filled with narrow teeth, meaning there was no defense for anything that passed through his way.

They were attacking anything that went into the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex would not have a fight.
While most of their dishes will be well-known to us, the Romans included their portion in strange or unusual feast items, including wild pigs, mores, horses and a kind of Rodent, called the Dormhouse.
Another difference was that where the poor people and women were sitting and eating on the chairs, the rich people liked to go together and celebrate, and when they were eating they had fun.
Ancient Roman food could not include foods that came from America or Asia to Europe in the subsequent centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, potatoes, and cacao, and no ancient Roman wassy ever tasted turkey.
The inhabitants of Babylon built a primary temple for each of their gods which was considered the house of the god.
People offer sacrifices for the gods and serve the gods by giving their time in priests and festivals.
Each temple had an open front of the temple and then an internal maternity in which only priests could enter.
The special pyramid-shaped tower (Pogoda), sometimes known as Zigurat, was built as a part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special garden for the god.

If you’ve seen the Film National Treasury, you’ll feel that behind the declaration of freedom a map of treasure was written.
However, this is not true. although something is written behind the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words written on the back of the Declaration of Freedom were the original Declaration of Freedom on 4 July 1776.
While no one knows who wrote it was gathered big leather paper documents to collect (this measurement is 241⁄2 inches 293⁄4).
Therefore, it is believed that the note was added just as a label.
D-Day landing and its further battles had liberated northern France, but southern France was still not free.
The “Vichy” was governed by the French people; these were the French people who established peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Friendly Nation invaded southern France, the invasion was called “Operation Dragon”.
In just two weeks, the American and free French forces had liberated southern France and moved towards Germany.
A culture is called a civilization that is divided into a large group of people, where people live in society and work together.
The word civilization comes from Latin Civilization, which means citizen, Latin Civilization, which means citizen, and Civilization, which means city or city-state, and it in a way also defines the shape of society.
A civilized culture means passing knowledge through many generations, a stable cultural trace and fair spread.
Small cultures end without great historical evidence and they cannot find the status of civilization.
During the revolutionary war under the Confederation article, thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government in which Congress was its only component.
Congress had no right to impose taxes, because there was no national executive or judicial authority. it depended on state officials, who often were not allies in implementing all their functions.
There was no right to override tax laws and taxes between its states.
Before the amendment of the article, all states needed unanimous agreement and the states did not take the central government seriously and their representatives often did not come to the assembly.

With the Italians competing in international sports and Olympic competitions, winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest islands is Honshu). it gives Japan the status of the 7th largest island in the world!
Near Japan, because it is a group of islands, Japan is geographically often referred to as “islands group”.
Taiwan was discovered in the 15th century by European sailors who called it Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in south-western Taiwan, which began a change in the method of indigenous grain production and appointed Chinese workers to work on their rice and Chinese gardens.
In 1683 the Ching dynasty (1644-1912) forced occupation of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan the province of the Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First China-Japan War (1894-1895) the Chinese government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it surrendered the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, which are Itihutan, the temple of the sun and a room with three windows.
Most buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can better find out how they originally looked.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been murdered until 1976, and the murder work continues until today.
For example, the most used photographic format in the world is 35mm. This analog film was quite common at the end of the film cycle.
It is still made today, but even more important is that its orientation ratio is inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
In fact, the 35mm format is slightly confusing, which is 24 times the height in the 36mm width.
The orientation ratio of this format (parting from twelve to obtain the simplest full-number ratio) is therefore called 3:2 .
Many common formats (e.g., APS family of formats) are almost equal to or close to this orientation ratio.
The third rule, which is multi-behavioral and often ridiculous, is a simple guidance that makes it dynamic while measuring the order in a picture.
This indicates that the most insecticus place for the main subject is on the spot that cuts the lines that shrink the image and divide it horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church that became rich and powerful came into the scope of examination.
Despite the differences in language and customs, Christianity has held the European countries together for thousands of years.
His universal power influenced everyone from the king to the general.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to reduce suffering and poverty and the monetary funds of the Church are especially why.
The central authority of the church in Rome has been for more than a thousand years and the focus of strength and money on the same place makes many people wonder whether this theory was completing or not.
Immediately after the hostility spread, Britain had started the German maritime occupation.
The strategy proved effective by cutting down important military and non-military supplies, although this blockade violated the international law commonly accepted by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering all parts of the sea, creating a threat to ships standing on the coast.
Since this strategy had only received a limited response, Germany had also expected a similar response with its unlimited submarine war.
During the 1920s the view of peace and separation was prevalent in most citizens and countries.
After seeing the horrors and torture of the war during the First World War, the nation wishes to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept jobs with Edison Company in New York City.
With 4 cents in their pockets, a book of poems and a recommendation letter addressed to Thomas Edison (written by the previous job manager) they arrived in the United States.
In ancient China there was a unique way to show different periods of time; every phase of China or every family that was in power was a special dynasty.
In addition, it was a period of instability regarding the division of states in every reign; in the same time, the division of three states between Han and whose reigns lasted for 60 years is quite famous.
During this period there was a terrible war between many riches struggling for the throne.
The Three Kings was an era of the most bloody spots in ancient China's history, thousands of people were killed, struggling to sit on the highest seat in the magnificent palace in Xi'an.
The use of the metric system, from absolutism to democracy, the change in nationalism and the confidence of the country is from people, not from one ruler, such things have much more social and political effects.
And, business after the revolution was open to all male applicants in which the most ambitious and successful could be successful.
The same applies to the army as the army’s ranking is now based on qualifications rather than based on the character.
The French Revolution also inspired many of the oppressed people of the working class present in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. They often used a cave for thought known as “hera” on the mountain of “Nur” (light).
They make themselves alone, which lasted for a long time, it gives a very bright image of Muhammad’s spiritual inclination.
The cave, located at the top of one of the mountains located north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it’s not easy to find it even if someone knows its presence. once you get to the cave, there you get completely alone.
A clean environment above, beautiful sky and many surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen, so from the inside of this cave, a small part of the world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is only one of the seven Ajuaba that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the Third Century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many major pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
There are many pyramids in the Giza Mountains, “Giza Necropolis” or the Egyptian Valley of the Dead (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples and great sphincks.
The great pyramids were built in honor of Ferro Gufou, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Gufou's wives and family members.

The next means that you should push the command starting from the top and the back means that you should pull the command starting from the frog (from which you hold the command by hand).
A top-pressure usually generates a silent sound, while a lower-pressure is stronger and louder.
Feel free to write on your own marks, but remember that there are also boeing marks printed for musical reasons, so usually they should be respected.
Angry King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antonette and her two children (11 year old Mary Thares and 4 year old Louis Charles) and Queen's sister Madame Elizabeth were forced to return to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris while traveling in a car surrounded by a crowd of crying people against the king and the queen.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to open the window of their car.
At one occasion, a man present in the crowd hit the head of the royal guardian killed in Versailles in front of the angry queen.
The U.S. imperialism's war expenditure in the victory of the Philippines was paid by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. Street colonial regime, which was to deceive a large part of the expenditure and interest on bonds imposed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses by the Phil Street government.
Of course, the superfasts obtained from the exploitation of the people of the Philippines will form the fundamental benefit of American imperialism.
To understand Templers, it is necessary to understand the reference that motivated the order to be given.
The time when the events occurred is generally referred to as the period of the high Middle Ages of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300) in European history.
High Middle Ages occurred before the early Middle Ages and then came the modern Middle Ages whose end is considered around 1500s.
Technical determinism is a term that involves a wide range of ideas in practice, driven by an intrinsic argument linked to their performance in scientific laws and technology, from technology-mounting or technical imperativity to strict meaning.
Most interpretations of technological determination tell about two general ideas: cultural or political impact on technological development does not have any impact and, instead of resulting in social adaptation, it “influences” technological societies.
For example, no one can say that motor cars necessarily affect the development of roads.
However, the traps of the roads placed throughout the country were not just affordable for a few cars, so new methods of production were developed to reduce the cost of buying cars.
The cause of more accidents on the streets is a lot of car onarship, which has promoted the invention of new technologies in Healthcare to improve the break-foot in the body.
In Romanium there was a great element of cultural imperialism, which was taken from writers such as Goethe, Fithe and Schlegel.
In the context of sanitaryism, geography shaped individuals and with time, as well as the geography-related customs and culture arose. because of being according to the place of society, these people were much better than the laws voluntarily imposed.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of today’s world, the same way Constantinople was considered as the fashion capital of front Europe.
It was known to be a subcentre of luxury from around 400 A.D. to 1100 A.D.
Its status decreased during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that religious warriors brought gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was the time when Constantinople was removed and Paris was awarded the title of fashion capital.
From the 10th to the 11th century and in the 14th century the Gothic style was at the peak.
Dress in the beginning was quite influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, the residence of the West can go 25-30 years back.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its style. As a result of the religious war, one of the greatest developments of the time people began to use the buttons to bind clothes
Excessive agriculture is only done to meet the needs of the farmer and his family and to produce enough food.
Living-based farming is a simple, often organic, system in which saved seeds of the local geographical area are used to take more harvests in a harvest cycle or other relatively easy techniques.
Historically, the majority of farmers have livestock-based farms, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with the same ideology who feel behind in social standards and allow them to develop their sense of identity.
The age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members may cause differences in subcultures.
The qualities that make a subcultural different, such as language, beauty, religion, politics, sex, geography or a mixture of many factors.
Members of a subcultural often indicate their membership through a specific and symbolic use of the style, which includes fashion, fashion and special offers.
Some of the most common ways used to clarify the importance of socialization is to attract unfortunate cases of children, which were not neglected by adults during adulthood, but occurred through neglect, misfortune or abuse.
Such children are called “passive tendencies” or wild; some wild children are kept different from the world; in some cases, parents do so due to a mental or physical deficiency of children.
It is possible that imprisoned children may face serious child abuse or trauma before leaving or fleeing.
Others were allegedly covered with animals; some say they were living in the forest themselves.
After being completely covered by non-human animals, wild babies do almost the same behavior (within physical limits) as careful animals do, such as fear or negligence to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scapholding is even a step ahead.
Scapholding is not a method of learning, but it is helpful for people who are learning something new like running a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scapholds can also be virtual and real, in other words, teachers are a kind of scapholds but Microsoft Office's Paperclip Man is the same.
Virtual scaphold software is the only inner part of the software and they question, signal and provide information about processes that are challenging for the student to deal with alone.
Children are placed in fast care for a number of reasons, including neglecting, bad behavior, and even forced recovery.
Any child should never grow in an environment that is not nutritive, caring and educational, but they are growing.
We consider the Foster Care System a safe area for these children.
Our parental care system provides safe home, loving care, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is to meet all kinds of needs that were not found in the house from which they were brought.
The Internet, people and inter-interpersonal communication, combines the elements of both.
The different features of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the use and satisfaction approach.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are described as the key reasons for the use of the internet (James et al., 1995).
“When Amy and McCord (1998) investigated audiences’ responses on websites, they were recognized as new aspects that inspired ‘private participation’ and ‘stable relationship’.
The use of video recording in interpreting micro-expressions, facial movements in which a few milliseconds appear, has promoted important findings.
In particular, it is claimed that by correct interpretation of a person’s subtle expressions it can explain whether he is lying or not.
Oliver Sachs pointed out in his Paper The Presidential Speech how people who don’t understand the speech due to mind loss still can correctly assess honesty.
They also suggest that the ability to interpret in human behavior can also be shared through animals such as pets.
The research of the twentieth century has shown that genetic diversity has two swimming pools: hidden and expressive.
The mutation adds new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the pool of express variation.
Separation and reassembly differences remain forward-back between two pools with each generation.
In Savana, the plants available to meet its amino acid needs for the primates with a digestive system like humans are likely to fall less.
In addition, failure to do this has serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition and eventually death.
The easiest resources from plants contain proteins found in leaves and flies, but for primates like us it is difficult to digest without cooking it.
On the contrary, animal foods (chicken, candy, eggs) are not only easily digestive, but they provide high amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
If our ancestors solved their “protein problem” to some extent in the same way, we should not be surprised, as they chimpage in today’s time.
Sleep interruption is the process of awakening you during your normal sleep period and after a short time (10-60 minutes) it goes away.
It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into consciousness without fully awakening.
If you find yourself re-seting the clock in your sleep, put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get up from the bed to close it.
Other biorad-based options include drinking a lot of liquid before sleep (especially water or tea, a common urethral), making a person forced to urinate.”
The amount of inner peace in a person is associated in contrast to the amount of stress in his body and soul.
The less anxiety, the more positive life energy communication. Every man can find ultimate peace and satisfaction.
One thing in the way to this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhist teachings, but it has been enhanced by many techniques from the Mahayan Road of Love and Indian Yoga.
Theoretically Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the way to embrace everyone with love.
Kundalini energy (knowledge energy) is awakened by Kundalini yoga through yoga motions, breathing exercises, mantles and mentality.
The devil yoga is the center of Tibetan meditation. The image of different gods cleans the energy channels, cycles are activated and self-knowledge consciousness is built.
Under the leadership of cooperation between the USSR and the US, Germany was a common enemy in World War II. The battle ended and the country began to break due to conflicts of systems, processes and cultures.
In the last two years of the battle, the former partners became enemies and the Cold War had already begun.
It had to last for the next 40 years and it had to be, in fact, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defence was almost broken, and a single hope was to withdraw back and then unite with the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, almost night-night these plans were made when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union of the Red Army entered the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after attacking the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships for the transport of goods is a much more effective way of bringing and transporting large amounts of people and goods from one side to the other.
The task of the Navy is traditionally to maintain the ability to transfer people and goods of their country from one place to another, and to interfere with the ability to transfer people and goods of their enemy country.
The most remarkable recent example of it was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. The U.S. was trying to move troops and materials into the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
In addition, the German Navy was mainly trying to stop this traffic using the U-boat.

Vagonways were built in England at the beginning of the 16th century.
Nevertheless, typically the vagonways had uniform wooden tights, but the horses could pull them fast and carry greater burdens on the slightly worse roads of those days.
Crostaie was introduced in practice much earlier to keep the trails in their place. but slowly it felt that if the trails were iron leaves above, they would be more efficient.
It became common, but the iron vehicles were more hanging on the wooden wheels.
Finally, the iron wheels replaced the wooden wheels. in 1767, the rail was completely made of iron.
The first known transport was walking, humans had started walking twenty million years ago with the emergence of the Homo erectus (i.e. the unfair man).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not go straight.
4.2 to 3.9 million years ago Astrelopopithecus was found specialized in bipadals although it could be 7 million years ago Centropus could walk on two legs.
We can start living in a way more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement for it, and we can also become environmental workers to save the future somewhat from suffering.
However, if we don’t just want temporary solutions, we should deactivate them by finding the root of problems.
It is extremely clear that the world has changed considerably due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have increased due to the greater population and the excessive lifestyle of mankind.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a hand-written draft was signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thron, then it was sent to some block away John Dunlop's printing store.
It forms copies between 150 and 200 in the night, which is now known as “Dunalp Broadsides”.
John Nixon's first public reading of the document was held on July 8 in the yard of the Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it on July 9 in New York for his army.
The existing 25 Dunlop Broadside are the oldest copies documented so far. The original copy written by hand cannot be saved.
Many pesticide scientists still today believe that a group of dinosaurs have survived the extinction and they are still alive today, we call them birds.
Because of their wings and flight, many people do not believe them as dinosaurs.
But there are a lot of things about the birds that still look like dinosaurs.
Their legs have paths and arms, they give eggs, and they walk on their two back legs like a T-Rex.
Today, all the computers used are based on manipulation of information and are coded as a binary number.
A binary number may have one of the two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers themselves are called binary points - or bit in the computer vocabulary.
Its symptoms are common, such as vomiting, so it cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best symptom of internal positioning may be the presence of an open box of drugs or toxic domestic chemicals.
See the label for special primary medical instructions for that particular poison.
The word bug is used by insect scientists formally for this group of insects.
This definition is made from chronic equality with the most favourable insect crust dependent on humans.

The main objective of science is to explore the way the world works through scientific methodology. in fact, most scientific research is determined on this methodology.
Although it’s not alone, experimenting, and experimenting is a test that uses one or more possible hypotheses to eliminate, question, and observe even scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Bible written in Latin.
The ideas of Aristotle on all matters of science including psychology are accepted.
As Greek knowledge decreased, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
In many logos it has been seen in physics and practice, often the appearance of intramuscular cycles depends on biological clocks and their production.
Such a topical rhythm that is not just a reaction of external topical signs has been recorded for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-dependent oscillators that will continue the free cycle even in the absence of external signals for a period of time.
One major suggestion of the test of Hershe and Chase was that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershe and Chase used the phase or virus to put their DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by making the DNA distorted with radioactive phosphorus or marking the protein of distorted with radioactive sulphur.
Varieties of mutation, the importance of the piece of affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are German-line cells, depending on it, mutation has various different effects.
Only the growth of German-line cells can reach children while the growth that occurs elsewhere can destroy cells or cause cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in seeing natural landscapes, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Going to Borneo, making photography, and learning about andangutan is an example.
To go to work leave the small cities with their trains and the workplace passed by others that they have just left.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow connected, and supports the transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this enormous carbon economy has removed the biomass from one of its stable conditions that has helped human development over the past twenty million years.
Everyone is connected to society and uses the transport system. Almost all people complain about the transport system.
In developed countries you rarely hear complaints of similar levels of water quality or the fall of bridges.
Why does the transport system promote such complaints? why do they go behind every day? are the transport engineers unable? or is there any other major disruption in this system?
Traffic flow is the study of the activity of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the mutual action that is carried out with each other.
Unfortunately, the traffic flow is difficult to study because the driver’s behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers run within a reasonable and consistent range; thus, the traffic stream has some reasonable stability and generally it can be shown mathematically.
To better show traffic flow, three main characteristics are associated: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) weight.
These relationships help in planning, design and roadway facilities operations.
The insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and also get food and companion more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from taking their wings back on their body.
It gives them a very large range of small places to hide from hunters.
Currently, insects that can’t turn their wings back are only dragonflies and meflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus had said that the solar system was rotating around the Sun.
Some people thought it was right but many people thought it was the opposite; the solar system (and even other stars) appeared to circle around the earth, including the Sun.
It seems logical, because it doesn’t feel like the Earth is moving, right?

Since ancient times, people have had information about chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can be found in the original form in nature and it is relatively easy to find through primary tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proved that everything is made up of a mixture of one or four elements; they were earth, water, air and fire.
It was the same as the four conditions of most substance (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although they also established the theory that they turn into new substances even more than we see.
The mixture is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements on the repeated sheet.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also take mixed metals that include a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
All objects in the universe are made up of matter; all substances are made up of subtle particles, which are called molecules.
The atoms are incredibly so small that they can fit in the point that appears at the end of the phrase in the number of trillions.
Thus, when the pencil came it was a good friend for many people.
Unfortunately, as-as new ways of writing have evolved, the condition of the pencil and the use have been reduced.
People now write messages on the computer screen, no need to use the sharpner.

The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. the outer layer of the moon is called cross.
The thickness of the cross on the nearest edge is about 70 kilometers and on the distant edge it is 100 kilometers.
It is thin under the sea and thin under the high areas.
There will be many Maria around due to being thin. it was easy to rise on the surface for lava.
The theory of content focuses on finding what tics people or what attracts them.
These principles indicate that people had some such needs and/or desires that were adult within them.
These theories see what things are about some people that ask them to do the same things they want and what side of their environment they ask them to do something or not.
Two popular subject-object theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of requirements and Hertzberg's theory of two facts.
In common words, when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, two types of behaviors appear: a spot of spectrum is trying to remain “one of those boys” (or one of the girls).
Such managers have difficulties in making different decisions from all thought, taking discipline-related actions, examining work, giving responsibilities and determining people’s responsibilities.
At the same time, the second edge of the spectrum, a person takes the shape of an unprecedented person who thinks he should change everything in the team and make it according to his own account.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of his team.
This bargain sometimes creates breaks between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are also placed on the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but they have subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often work as a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They have more freedom than traditional team members because their teams can meet different time areas that may not understand their local management.
The presence of a true “Invisible Team” (Larson & Lafasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the management team on which each member reports.The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Why would a organization want to adopt the process that takes more time to establish a training organization? an objective of bringing the concept of organizational training into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in the functional departments of an organization, both creativity and simplicity become possible.
Consequently, the process of a collaborating organization that is working to overcome any obstacle, can be an innovative process for the needs of customers.
Before any organization can become a newman, leadership must create a culture of newman as well as share knowledge and organizational teaching.
Angels (2006) interpreted Continent Aproach as the method used to help organizations reach the highest level of work.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the examination of knowledge. therefore, these limit the field of research and make it somewhat more accurate.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, trauma, injuries and tumors affect some mental behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
With the growth of new technologies we can check the brain’s composition and processes that have never been seen before.
It provides a lot of information and content to create a simulation model, which helps us understand our brain processes.
Although AI has a strong meaning of science fiction, AI makes a very important branch of computer science, which includes dealing with behavior, learning in a machine and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves creating machines to automatize tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Its examples include control, planning and timing, customer diagnosis and answering questions as well as handwritten identification, offer and face.
Such things have become different disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Today AI systems are often used in the economics, pharmaceutical, engineering and military sectors, as many home computers and video games software applications have been created.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. Teacher will often prefer to take his students to places where there is just no choice for a trip.
Students can see the artworks of the museum, visit a aquarium, or admire beautiful art by sitting together in their classroom.

For example, thousands of students of the Benet School of North Carolina each year design a website about their visit to the state’s capital. the website is rebuilt every year, but some old versions are placed online to be used as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help to improve student writing. where students often start their blog experience with random grammar and literature, the presence of the audience generally changes it.
Since students are often the most critical audience, blog writers begin to try to improve writing to avoid criticism or review.
As well as blogging “drives students to keep more information about the world around them.” the need to meet the audience’s interest inspires students to become exciting and interesting. (toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation, and encourages students to learn better from the traditional school day.
The correct use of blogs “can enable students to be more analytical and reflective; by actively responding to internet content, students can define their situations in the context of writing by others. as well as can make their own approach to a particular subject online (Oravek, 2002).
