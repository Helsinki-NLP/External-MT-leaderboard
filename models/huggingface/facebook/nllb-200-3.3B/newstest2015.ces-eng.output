A change of venue at the last minute?
Anything is possible .
Today is the last day to jump through the transfer window and make a big move.
The next chance will come in the winter.
Petr Čech, currently Chelsea's reserve goalkeeper, is now unable to negotiate a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He's sitting in the NH Hotel in Sich, talking to Czech journalists and preparing to play the Czech national team against the Americans and then also for the Euro 2016 qualifying match against the Netherlands.
Chelsea's goalkeeper is Thibaut Courtois, who has been substituted for the first time in ten years at the London club.
There was speculation a while ago that Cech might be interested in Real Madrid.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup in the opening match of the season against Atlético and did not manage to even enter the league season, when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He's won the French league twice and drawn twice, and on Sunday he beat St. Etienne 5-0.
The club with the most pressure is AS Monaco.
He's 1-1-2 in the league and he split with Lille on the weekend, 1-1.
News has surfaced on the English tabloid web today that the Czech could be signed by Queens Park Rangers.
But according to the English bookmakers, Cech's last-minute departure from Chelsea is not very likely.
Skybet has set a course for it at 4:1.
Peter, is it possible that you're going to change your uniform in the next few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never 100% in football.
Maybe during the day, an offer comes along that can't be turned down.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know what an offer you can't refuse looks like.
There would have to be a consensus of all parties, and it would depend on Chelsea's position on whether or not the club would consider the offer.
Is it technically feasible to make such a move now that you're in Prague?
Wouldn't you need to sign a new contract somewhere in the new field?
I didn't think about it that way.
But there are a lot of players in that situation today, and they're all at the national team meetings somewhere, and there's definitely going to be a lot of transfers today.
So it would be doable somehow.
How many clubs on the planet can afford you?
I don't know.
And you're not pressuring them to leave?
The situation of not catching in the first three games of the new season is new to me after 15 years of my career.
However, there's no reason to panic, pack up and go somewhere.
I want to continue to be involved in this fight for the Chelsea goalkeeper position, and it's up to the coach to choose who he chooses, what decisions he makes over the next few weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I take all factors into account.
I mean, obviously, the sporting aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from a personal perspective, which of course includes the needs of the family.
Is it possible you could catch for another club in England?
That's a question I thought I'd never have to face.
But in football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan at Tokyo Summit
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo to meet with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe, his first major visit since winning the May election to discuss economic and security commitments.
Modi is on a five-day visit to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world's third largest economy.

According to intelligence sources, India also hopes that both nations will agree to cooperate on defense issues.
Police in Karratha arrest a 20-year-old man after a motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after it had gone 125 km/h in the 70 km/h zone and had gone into the bush to escape the police.
Traffic police patrolling Karratha this morning attempted to stop a blue motorcycle at the curb when they noticed it was going at 75 miles an hour at the Bathgate Road service station exit.
Police say the driver didn't stop and continued down Burgess Road and then veered into the bush, so the officers lost sight of him.
A motorcycle and a person matching the driver's description were later found in a house on Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
Karratha police have charged a 20-year-old man with failing to obey a stop sign and driving recklessly.
He's due to appear in court in Karratha on September 23.
The bike was impounded for three months.
George Webster accused of rape in Nairn and Pitlochry hotels
A man will be arraigned on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was introduced to the charge during a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman on June 7, 2013 at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
According to the allegations, Webster assaulted her while she was unconscious, asleep and unable to give consent.
Webster is also charged with the rape of another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scottish Highlands, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae has set a hearing date for November 17th at the High Court in Edinburgh.
A renewal of the very American ideal that labor rights are also human rights.
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill that would protect union organizing as a civil right.
"The way unions work, middle-class jobs work", says Ellison, a Democratic senator from Minnesota who co-chairs the Congressional Committee.
That's why I'm so proud to be able to join with the model of occasional rights John Lewis to introduce a bill to empower employees.
This groundbreaking legislation gives workers the same legal options to fight union organizing discrimination as other forms of discrimination - and stops anti-union forces from being able to take over the workforce.
Amending the Employment Relations Act to allow all employees facing discrimination to take civil action if they want to join a union - and to seek compensation or damages - is the right and necessary step.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other proponents of the bill are proposing is to go back to the American ideal.
Despite the labor struggles that have occurred in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans have long supported countries around the world to accept, extend and respect labor rights.
There was a time, and millions of Americans still remember it, when the country, in one breath, stood for democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assemble.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisors encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Tojo's military autocracy would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan, they included language in them and openly recognised that 'the right of workers to assemble, to bargain collectively and to negotiate is guaranteed'.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that workers would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, and so they included a clause that openly said: "The right to form associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or profession.
Arrangements which limit or seek to impair this right shall be abolished and any measures which serve such a purpose shall be unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the drafters and Roosevelt included in it a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests".
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to build a civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to form labor unions -- and their participation in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies as an equal partner -- must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and to fight for themselves in a free and open society.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the unions have not diminished the strength of the nation, but have expanded it.
They have raised the living standards of millions of people, created a market for industry, and raised production to unprecedented levels.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination in trade union organisation - has been long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that lifted America and made it a true promise of democracy.
A judge has temporarily blocked a bill that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that lawyers say would likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
A bill signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, to take effect on September 1, would require doctors performing abortions to have the right to admit a patient to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's ruling means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions temporarily, and in the meantime, they must obtain a license.
"The petitioner will be able to legally carry out its activities and in the meantime obtain a permit", says the ruling by Federal Judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled in one month's time so the judge can issue a more permanent ruling on the law.
Abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, the latest in a series of similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain permits.
"Today's decision assures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from a malicious law designed to take away their health and their rights", said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has sued three of the five clinics on behalf of blocking the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also affected doctors from two clinics that were not among the complainants and are also seeking this authorisation.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional by statute.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Women's rights campaigners, along with the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need for such a license places requirements on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion objected that the measure was intended to protect women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that the measure would result in the closure of clinics.
The Center for Reproductive Rights has stated that there is only one licensed abortion doctor in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure out of fear for his safety, the group said.
Louisiana authorities responded by saying they would not charge doctors who performed abortions while waiting for a petition to be granted rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor access to treatment, ovarian cancer kills more often in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video in tribute to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Rural women in Australia are at a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than their urban counterparts.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent survived five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan, of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
A NEW STUDY: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers followed the woman for seven years during the treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the odds of survival were affected by the age of the women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other pre-existing conditions and socioeconomic status.
The lowest survival rate was found in older women with more advanced cancer.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says that factors may be late diagnosis and poor access to treatment.
Gyneco-oncologists, who are usually based in larger cities, are best placed to treat the disease, she said.
Despite improvements in telehealth services to overcome the barrier of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help to strengthen transportation services to allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and support programs for people who are treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that long-term survival rates for women with ovarian cancer are low regardless of geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is being published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, Elisha Neave, a young mother from the Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret the decline in homeownership
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary loss of homeowners under 35 could lead to garden centres losing up to £10 million a year by the time today's younger generation of consumers reaches the 'main age group of gardeners'.
According to the report, people who rent out their homes spend on average 55 percent of the amount people who live in their own homes spend on their gardens.
Other factors threatening the estimated £5 billion-a-year industry include the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the increasing popularity of roofs over front-line parking spaces, and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the share of home ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% over six years, the per household expenditure on horticultural products is the lowest in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society stated that living in a shed or having a shortage of space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser for RHS, said: 'It is very popular with tenants to grow plants in pots - they can take the plants with them when they move.'
The HTA report revealed that the golden age of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher homeownership rate and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales this year due to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the dictator of the East preaches democracy.
After Putin, at the convention of his youth organization, which reminds me most of the Hitler Youth, gave a nuclear bomb and basically made it clear to everyone that he doesn't care about their views, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia displays many of the features of a fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both extreme nationalism and the fact that they can transform the complex of inferiority into imperialist appetites.
Time seems to flow differently in the East than in the West.
While the Western world thought that the era of wars for domination over Europe was long gone, the East, on the contrary, thought that they had been neglected for a long time and that their international position had to be regained.
Such was the mood and frustration in Germany in the 1930's, just before the Nazis seized power and then followed an outbreak of nationalism unlike the situation in Russia today.
And then the very similar cult of the strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, they are indeed quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of the Russian people, probably miss the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other half trembled before them.
Maybe the Western politicians were blaming themselves, maybe Vladimir wasn't given enough pat on the back, maybe he wasn't invited to the places he wanted to go and maybe they underestimated him and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He'd clean up his house, pretend he didn't want to go anywhere, and sharpen his knives.
Now he's decided to take back the lost ground.
He starts slow, he's got time.
The Führer is probably for life, so where would he be in such a hurry?
He's trampled the Caucasians, now he's trampling the Ukrainians, now it's the turn of the Baltic dwarves.
You've been pinching the Russian bear in the coat long enough.
China will notice that, too, because it's getting a bit too big and is probably going to the Far East.
And the Germans are also annoying that Vladimir, how well they are and that we gave them in 45 so on the ass.
How about we make a new Novorossiya in the Charles Vague.
It's a base, and there are many of us, and they're oppressed, and they've tried to overthrow some of them.
Our veterans still remember what it was like in Czechoslovakia.
Well, their Prime Minister, Gospodin Sobotka, is so soft, he can be peeled like an onion and eat their entire EU.
That'd be a great way to get them to go all out on Great Russia.
They need to be reminded of their place.
And as detonators, we'll use our compatriots who live on their turf.
There are enough Russians everywhere, and when they say they're oppressing them, they're oppressing them, and we're not going to let that happen, we're going to protect them.
And again the Russian will rule, for what else is he born.
Europe is only good as a platform for proud Ivan to dance his pussy on.
Turkey has summoned a US diplomat to a spy briefing.
The Turkish foreign minister called the top American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the US charge d'affaires and Turkish state officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept reported that according to documents provided by a former National Security Agency analyst, Turkey was a priority target of American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major countries were watching each other.
An earlier report that German intelligence had also targeted Ankara has drawn a more angry response from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones has introduced the new tricks of the fourth series
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth season of the cult series.
They also bragged about how they created the fourth row of tricks.
Most visible are the computer-generated sequences and the mass scene where a bunch of soldiers become a giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented to the Mallorcan State Prosecutor's Office evidence of blackmail by police and state officials against the municipality of the Autonomous Region of Calvia.
The police chief of Calvia, on the holiday island of Mallorca, has been arrested after charges were brought against businessmen and bar owners in the notorious party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after corruption charges were brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday the complainants presented evidence to the prosecutor of the Mallorcan anti-corruption office of extortion by police and state officials at the municipality of the autonomous region of Calvia.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police in connection with the corruption allegations and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC quoted disgruntled owners of nightclubs who said that the favours given by public officials had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about surviving", one of the entrepreneurs said in court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines around the world after a YouTube video of an 18-year-old British tourist giving oral sex to 24 men during a tour of bars was released.
The island authorities have since sought to keep an eye on drunks and rioters in the ranks of holiday partygoers in Magaful by reducing the number of notorious drinking tours in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse, where the oral sex act took place, was forced to close for a year and pay a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000) along with the organizers of the Carnage bar tour.
The Magaluf resort, which is popular with the British, has also seen a number of drunk driving incidents, including a fashion wave known as "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and storms that affected the flight at Adelaide Airport
AFRILLAIN brought an icy surprise to the south of South Australia, with heavy rain and high winds that severely affected the Adelaide airport.
Another 5 millimeters of rain is expected to fall in the city until 9 p.m. and another 6.6 millimeters will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain arrived along with several short bursts of thunderstorms and gusty winds that began before 8 p.m. and brought nearly 4 mm of rainfall in about ten minutes.
After a few early bouts of spring came after last week's winter, the city's temperature dropped again on Monday to just 15.8 degrees.
The stormy weather is thought to have contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but a change in wind speed or direction caused the landing to be delayed.
Wind gusts at Adelaide Airport at that time reached about 30 miles per hour on the ground.
Flight data indicated that the plane had to abort from a second landing and finally arrived at approximately 8:40 p.m.
The delay of the plane subsequently caused delays to other flights including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
The forecast for Tuesday is for temperatures in Adelaide to reach a maximum of 16 degrees Celsius and one or two overcast showers.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters while their homes were attacked by rockets and mortars during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the communities in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting are still visible.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, staff at a missile-hit kindergarten have removed the debris from the wall and are slowly awaiting the return of the children.
"We are a little scared, but otherwise we are looking forward", said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at a local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it was a little strange to go back to school all of a sudden.
"We've had some hard times and we never left the house", she said.
Kibbutz, located near the border with Gaza, was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the residents.
Until the ceasefire last week ended the war, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad stayed inside their homes or left their homes and headed to safer areas far from Gaza to escape the rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border where a Palestinian mortar round killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The Minister of Education said that about a dozen families still had not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the border with Gaza that has been hit hard by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study hard, adding: "We will provide you with education and security".
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire led to an immediate cessation of hostilities, but it did not resolve key issues such as Hamas' demands to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen Gaza's airports and ports.
Israel demands the disarming of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza radicals fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells into Israeli cities, especially in the south of the country, during the fighting.
The Israeli military has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in 100 UN schools, which have been turned into temporary shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in shelters and the ongoing fighting, school officials delayed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will open soon so that we can complete our education like Jewish children and other children around the world", said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from a school in Gaza's largest city.
I'm with you.
And Lafatu is suffering from fever
The Czech national football team met in Prague before noon today before Wednesday's preliminary match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualification against the Netherlands.
Of the 23 players, Spartan forward David Lafata is suffering from a fever.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some issues last week, it was a multi-player thing, and David's still having some issues.
But we want him to be here and be fine as soon as possible", coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"Whether it will be two or three days, or if he will be fit tomorrow, that will be determined by his state of health, which will be decided by our doctor", he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has a disability, but it's not like they can't train or participate in the match on Wednesday with the USA", the Czech coach said.
On Sunday night Vrba called as the last player Spartan defender Lukaš Vácha.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, considering other centrists.
I made my decision based on the fact that Luke is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
It was a very difficult decision, but I stand by it", Vrba told Vách.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latta.
It is not excluded that the appointment could be changed in case of health problems.
On a weekend with a great performance, for example, the Liberec Josef Šural, who scored a hat-trick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form recently.
Let's see how David Lafata is doing.
In case he is not available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot nominate any of the players who have been involved in the Czech league", said Vrba.
This afternoon, the national team will be training at Strahovka, and then on Tuesday, the classic pre-match training before the duel with USA at Letno, which will be open to fans and followed by a car parade.
The match against the Americans is on Wednesday at 8:15 and the national team will be looking for their first victory under the Vrba.
In the previous three preliminary matches, he has drawn two and lost one.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is scheduled for September 9th, starting at 20:45.
Walking to Italy from the Netherlands
The Wire is happy to have more time for training than at previous meetings.
There's an advantage to having players for eight days and having them practice certain things that we may not have had that much time for before.
Now we can only concentrate on preparing ourselves as well as possible for the Netherlands", said Vrba.
The Dutch will be in Italy on Thursday to prepare for the match in Prague, and the duel will be personally watched by former interim coach Josef Pešice.
It gives us information that's from the match.
But it's not just about him, we'll have the fight on tape and we'll take it apart.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we'll see what changes there will be", Vrba told the bronze medalists from the recent World Championships.
According to the closely watched statistics, winter housing prices have increased the most in seven years.
According to the Australian Capital Territory CoreLogic Hedonic Data Index, housing prices rose by 1.1 percent in August, the agency said Monday.
The increase resulted in an overall increase for June, July and August of 4,2%, the highest increase for a winter month since 2007.
The annual price increase climbed to 10,9%, more than doubling for the one year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said that Sydney and Melbourne lead the market.
RP Data figures show that Sydney's house prices rose by 16.1% last year, while Melbourne's prices rose by 11.7%.
The next strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price increases averaging between five and six per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which was hit hard by government-mandated spending cuts and where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent over the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has arrived, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
In view of the continued high rate of auctions, the generally high speed of sales and the low interest rate, it is likely that the value of housing will increase further over the next three months,he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said "I love you" to me.
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, in the Midlands.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in a factory, had a colder relationship.
Henry is trying out a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and is part of a Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and the melody is upbeat.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through "deep" therapy and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew so little about him.
You never saw his face, you only heard his voice: "Stop making that noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Get out of the way!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton -- when I was a kid, they were adults -- would go to bars with him and discuss things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I never spoke to him like that.
Most of my life, I've been a serious guy in a corner reading the paper.
Henry had recently visited the Dudley Foundry, and although conditions were better than in his father's day, he had a glimpse of what life must have been like for him.
It's a little lighter now, but it's still a dark, smoke-filled, cloudy labyrinth where flames are burning and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad would always climb into the tub and just lie there, and then you'd hear him slowly singing to himself because he was laughing off the lard.
As I walked around, I realized that he'd been doing this for years to support his family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Yet Henry lived through a childhood without parental love.
Dad never hugged anyone, never said "I love you".
It wasn't until my mom was sick and dying that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you".
His daughter Billie, with Dawn French, has allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you" stuff?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22 years old
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
He and French, his wife of 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and I started to have the symptoms of diabetes, the doctor said, "You have to make a radical change".
So I started going to a big fitness center, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And tiring too.
Nobody wants to eat all the carrots.
The change in direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-haired beard.
After receiving critical acclaim for his Othello, he immersed himself in the theatre.
Followed by The Comedy of Errors and August Wilson's Fences.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ spotted him on stage parodying someone, and he wrote about him in the New Faces talent show.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time, I was the only black impersonator/comedian on TV".
He learned as he went.
Besides having to be noticed by the public, I also had to learn how to make good jokes, be a star, and be on TV between 1975 and 1985, and that was really hard.
Lenny in the New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which the actors dressed as blacks, Henry ended up performing his comedy in it for five years.
My family was already upset about it.
I kind of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on the big stages and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was for years and years the most acclaimed product of British television, but was also a grotesque parody of black people.
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles, introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known for his role as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decade took him through commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles, but after his series LennyHenry.tv aired on the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what are you going to do now, Len, because it looks like you're stuck in one place or you're going off the track a bit".
Next up was a documentary on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really teach it in school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, they said, "You should try it".
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry had read 20 lines of Othello's closing speech for the documentary and was already on the job.
It made me feel like I could do it.
Like it gives me courage.
It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out about it.
So the audition was hard, and I had read the play for months and months before.
And it was a success.
It seemed like they were waiting for trouble, which they weren't.
He soon began to act in Comedy of Errors.
I was at the National Theatre, I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought, "You've changed".
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for the distraction of the audience.
The voice in my head said, "Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes".
Instead, the theater director announced that the play would continue once the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God".
It's not my responsibility.
I can get someone else to handle this for me.
You're acting, so stay in character.
Henry in Plotech at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lyrics of the Fences was a challenge.
Panic is a good thing, it adds up.
The play was also well received, so it's like a sign from God saying, "This is what you should do".
Of course, he says it in a WELL-NUT voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really like it.
I like being in the study.
Yet, Henry retains the comedian's brain - interrupting our conversation with humorous performances, in and out of the role of impersonator.
I decided not to do stand-ups because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I would say.
If you're always looking for something, you can get into a dead end.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but it doesn't feel like it anymore.
I asked if he'd ever do any more stand-up tours.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps outline the beginning, middle and end of a journey -- I don't think I'd ever want to give that up.
So, your new incarnation?
I think it is.
I like acting.
It's fun.
You're always telling stories, which is great.
I love the stories.
People like stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shed light on non-existent staff
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all its civil servants in an attempt to remove non-existent employees from the government payroll.
According to the government's announcement, employees who do not register for the next two weeks will no longer receive their pay.
The government believes that thousands of people are still getting paid after they leave the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to curb corruption in the public administration.
An audit this year showed that the state is losing at least $1 million a month (£700,000) in salaries to non-existent employees and other abuses of office.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts even after the employee's death or after the employee leaves the civil service, the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri in the capital Nairobi reported.
All state officials must report to identification centers within the next two weeks, where their biometric data will be recorded, the government statement said.
It also says that anyone who fails to appear without a proper apology will be removed from the payroll.
By identifying genuine public service employees, the measure will make a significant contribution to its economy and will also be used to clean up payroll at both levels of government, thus addressing the issue of non-existent staff,said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
Local media reports say that a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of plotting against the government.
The police department has not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 high-ranking officials were among those detained.
Some of them were implicated in the December corruption investigation, which targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen's campaign against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine have returned to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after summer vacation.
This day is traditionally important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the press that not all schools have reopened, but he is determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools have a traditional ceremony on September 1st.
Not all of Ukraine is at peace.
We must fight for peace.
All of Ukraine, the United Ukrainian Front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at the school in Slavyansk attended by Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children donning sewn shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Rhona Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for the tough times.
He brings with him a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management and the inner circle of the Conservative Party.
She's experienced from the front lines.
She started her career at Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the media world at Pearsons.
She was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a junior colleague took over the top job at Pearson's parent company.
It is said that her severance pay was approaching a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, the former director of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former city councilman.
In May, I described the director's job as a poisoned chalice.
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the centre of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation is turning in two directions: inward to the top layer of the hierarchy of the BBC's own leadership, but also outward to the public's voice in times of turmoil when things aren't working.
It's a near-unsustainable monopoly that requires a thorough reform.
But what CEO would risk coming into a company as complex as a Chinese dynasty, tearing it apart, and thereby losing his job?
It's a tough call.
If it weren't so difficult, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink -- its power, its finances -- and its status revise.
As the competitive landscape expands and new technologies challenge old certainties, immediate negotiations on licence fees pose a great danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying a stake in what is arguably the largest media business in the world.
The BBC has a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households and each one costs only 40 pence a day.
And the BBC's approval rating is clearly rising: 53% in favour, up from 31% ten years ago.
The patterns of using the BBC's services have changed: Today, I can see the headlines on my mobile phone, and I can watch the shows I missed on my iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a much-loved and wonderful institution.
She needs a great director-- I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims that the offensive tweet was not approved
A tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry's official Twitter account, posted on Sunday, included an offensive image of the Democratic state's attorney general, who initiated criminal charges against Perry for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another tweet was posted on Perry's account that distanced itself from the previous one.
There was an unauthorized tweet that went out of my account.
"I disagree with the tweet and have deleted it", he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't respond to any of the inquiries right away.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it's unclear who is actually responsible for administering it.
The previous tweet posted a non-flattering, humorous picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay her office, which brought Perry, a possible candidate for president in the 2016 election, before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The caption in the tweet said, "I don't always drive with three times the legal blood alcohol level... but when I do, I'm suing Governor Perry for holding me accountable".
I'm the most ardent Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not led by Lehmberg's office.
It was headed by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the charges a tactical, political ploy.
His skilled legal team asked the judge presiding over the case to dismiss the charges because using the laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry suspended $7.5 million in state funds to the Department of Public Safety, which is based in Travis County and prosecutes corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection has triggered a formal complaint from a left-leaning group of civic activists.
Perry's official account is active and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth on his party committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might be done by tweeting a photo of himself running near a lake, with the words, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is back to "normal"
One of London's most prominent property developers warned that the housing market in south-east England had returned to normal activity.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices and widespread concerns about the credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the Berkeley high-end development company, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal levels of transactions from the peak in 2013. This provides a stable environment for operations".
London's housing market prospered during the depression, as foreign buyers flooded the capital.
According to the Cadastral Office, prices in the city jumped 18.5% in the past year alone, far outstripping the 6.7% average for England and Wales.
The average sale price of private, affordable, and student housing from Berkeley has risen by about a fifth in the last year, to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, with the pound rising, London's property market has not been as attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible "property tax" that politicians have floated ahead of next May's general election.
London-based real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market review, which introduced stricter lending rules, would also slow the pace of property sales and prices growth during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of mortgages approved for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate firm, has cut its forecast for London property prices to grow by 3% in 2015, based on the fact that house prices have already started to fall.
In the meantime, according to the real estate agency WA Ellis, the volume of transactions in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has fallen by a quarter each year.
Yet the demand for housing in the capital city of Berkeley was a blessing, as it increased the cash forwards sale to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: Demand for the right, good looking housing in a good location has remained the same and that's why forward selling has been maintained.
In June, the firm reported that it had sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the crisis peak in 2007.
Pre-tax profit increased by 40% to £380 million, revenue by 18% to £1.6 billion.
On the Monday before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley said he expected Berkeley's annual revenue to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be 450 million pounds.
Berkeley stocks are closing this afternoon at 23.96 on the London Stock Exchange.
A hacker has posted nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet.
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Academy Awards.
Pictures of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence leaked online because of a hacker who claimed to have the meaning of hundreds of other aspiring actresses.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games star confirmed that the Lawrence photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for "a clear violation of privacy".
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker allegedly obtained the photos, which were originally posted on the image-sharing site 4chan, through a leak in Apple's iCloud online storage system.
It's unclear how many of the photos are authentic, but the film's star Scott Pilgrim vs. the rest of the world Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope those of you looking at the photos my husband and I took in the privacy of our home years ago are happy with yourselves", Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from the Nickelodeon cable television series "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied the photos were real, tweeting: "These alleged nude photos of me are FALSE, people".
Better to cut it in half.
Buzzfeed reported Sunday night that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photos were real.
A special preview of Howard Jacobson 's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter " J "
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, they dissolved gradually like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only every now and then some woman told him he was too serious, complicated, impetuous, isolated and maybe a little fickle.
And then she shook his hand.
He's been a bit too quick to admit it.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The final sacrifice of this ability was a beginning love affair, which more than usual promised to relieve him of the loneliness of life and perhaps even to give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild hair and a flying heart from a village in the North Island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
She came south with an older companion, whom Kevern believed to be her aunt, who had inherited property in a damp but beautiful valley aptly named Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the bathtubs, the slugs were slithering their fingerprints through the windows as if they thought they owned the place, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds looked like giant cabbage heads.
The house was like a cottage in a children's story, scary and charming at the same time, with a garden full of secrets.
Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the shortlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on folding chairs in the long grass holding hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, tuning in absently to the public station that supplied the neighborhood with soothing music and soothing messages, as the sight of her sunburned crossed legs reminded him of the old song of a long-forgotten black comic that his father loved to listen to behind closed-circuit screens.
You have very big feet.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they didn't play songs like that on the radio anymore.
They weren't banned -- there really wasn't anything banned -- they just weren't playing.
They helped them get into the desuetudo, as did the word desuetudo itself.
Popular taste has done what the rules and the law would never do, and just as people choose the memoirs that make the poor man rich, the cooks and the romances, so they choose the ballads in music.
The cavern was taken by the day and he began to play the imaginary piano and in a rough, comic voice he sang a serenade to Aillini's big feet.
And she didn't.
"It was a favorite of jazz pianist Fats Waller", he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
His father used to do that when he wanted to suppress the letter "J" before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he played the game with his father.
If you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth for a word that started with a "J", it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny then, and it's not funny now.
He just knew he was expected to, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn has never heard of any.
Nor did jazz, though it was not outright illegal, play.
Improvisation is out of style.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
Same with humor.
His unpredictability got on people's nerves.
And jazz was humor expressed in songs.
Although he hadn't heard Sammy Davis Jr. until he was ten, Kevern knew jazz from his father's half-baked collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to tell him Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember a time when the most popular singers weren't black.
Also, no laws or compulsions.
A lazy society is one in which every part of it gratefully - with the gratitude of those fortunately spared - agrees to the principle of group gratitude.
Afro-Caribbean people with temperament and constitution were thrown for entertainment and athletics, and so they sang and ran.
People of Indian origin, as if by nature gifted with electronics, have taken responsibility for ensuring that no family is without a working telephone.
The Poles who stayed were plumbers, the Greeks who stayed washed dishes.
Those in the Gulf and Levant, whose grandparents didn't leave the country in a hurry while THAT HAPPENED, WHEN THAT HAPPENED happened -- they were afraid they'd be accused of having contributed to the fire, in fact they were afraid the fire would consume them next -- they opened restaurants where they sold labneh and smoked water pipe, they didn't pay attention to themselves and the inactivity slowly ate them up.
To each according to his talent.
Since she only listened to ballads, Ailinn found it hard to understand how the dirty words Kavern had just sung to her could be turned into music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really dirty", Kevern said.
Maybe only for people with very big feet.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of security.
No word could escape from behind the soundproofing sheets.
Ailinn still didn't know what she was doing.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers in his mouth in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought she was funny", he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief, blurring Kevern's view.
In the whole wide world, there was nothing but a trail of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think", she said suspiciously.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Are my legs too big?
He looked again.
Not the feet.
Maybe a little ankle...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate it?
That's not true, man.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you" to her, but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are what attract me", he tried.
I'm a little creepy.
That didn't work.
He was trying to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe Kavern was deliberately cruel.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons flushed herself out of bed, dropped the radio, and spilled her wine.
No wine, so the drink couldn't have been.
She seemed to shake in her agitation like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm sick of being a jerk", she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
She was sorry for him, both for his unkind words and for the fear in her eyes as she stood up to him.
You thought he was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern hemisphere where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that it was basically the same as here.
They were cut across by the same vast, icy ocean.
The same madmen, then, as they were, even more untouchable and more wretched than their forebears, smugglers and punks, roamed furiously from inn to inn, ready to lay their hands on any woman who dared to refuse them or ridicule them.
What a dick?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
To caress her first - caress became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: counterpoint to the bland love ballads that radio broadcast - first they caress her, then they kill her.
In Kevern's opinion, too much sophistication, because the cuddling was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons nonverbally told him to leave.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt bitter herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, as if she were watching him from a window in the upstairs room, a man who had been caught in what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was tight for him and for all men in general, even though some of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, shoulders down, ashamed, defeated, all his fighting spirit deserted him - why did she feel that she knew this look well, even though she could not remember a single moment, until today, that she had ever seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her feet.
About 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, a bright and passionate 32-year-old researcher working for Ofnow, the non-statutory Public Mood Monitoring System, prepared a short piece on the persistence of mild and moderate violence in areas of the country where it would be most likely to be mitigated or stopped if enough money and energy were spent on its elimination.
"Much has been done and much more needs to be done", she wrote, "to calm the inherent aggressiveness of people who have fought many battles and won most of them, especially in the secluded, hard-to-reach places of the country where, despite the tops of church towers towering over the living floors, human kindness has historically been rare".
But some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the pulpits.
While residents sigh over sentimental ballads, swallow unhappy stories, and declare firm belief in the value of marriage and family life, not only is the old brutality as stubbornly held in rural areas as it is in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that a new and aggressive intolerance is emerging in the home, the workplace, the streets, and even on the sports fields.
"Unfortunately you tend to have too florid a style", her superior said.
I would suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum has her head down.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
'I feel I don't have to answer that,' said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme has re-asserted her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Another silence.
"I'm not asking because", Rabinowitz said finally, "I have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudice in this workplace.
We serve an unbiased society.
But a certain kind of oversensitivity, which is in itself perfectly acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort judgment as you have demonstrated.
You're obviously biased against the church yourself - things you call "cruel" and "brutal" could also be interpreted by others as expressions of natural force and energy.
Always dealing with what happened, when it happened, as if it happened, as if it happened yesterday, is draining the earth of its vital life force.
While Rabinowitz was speaking, Esme Nussbaum was looking around.
Behind his head on the light board flashed in pink the recommendations that Ofnow had been sending out to the world for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, care for your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, converse, explain, compromise, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the spoken word is better than the written, but there's nothing better than love.
"I understand your reservations", said Esme Nussbaum, "but I am not saying that the wound has healed as we say it has".
My primary concern is that unless we're warned in advance, we're making the same mistake that led to what happened, if it happened.
But this time, we won't vent our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz has joined his fingertips.
That was supposed to mean infinite patience.
"You go too far", he said, "when you describe as mistakes the actions that your grandparents may or may not have taken.
You're going too far in talking about them venting their "fear" and "disbelief" of others.
Shouldn't I remind someone in your position that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we don't talk about us and them?
There were no "my" and there were no "oni".
All we know is that it was a chaotic time.
During which, if we're honest with ourselves, we've taken courage, none of us are without fault.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it's fair or not, what's done is done.
That was before.
There's nothing to add to that. We're all in agreement on this.
And just as there is no fault to be laid on anyone, so there are no things to be corrected, even if the correction were appropriate and possible.
But what use is the past if not to learn from it -
The past exists to be forgotten.
If I may add something to that -
Luther Rabinowitz has disconnected the fingertips.
"I'll take your report into consideration", he said, and let her go.
The next day, as she was going to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who crashed into the pavement in what passersby described as a "brutal and violent" manner.
Accidents are a fact of life.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesotho says no coup is planned - Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Military officers of the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied organising a coup to overthrow the government and claim that they were acting against police suspects in an attempt to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has fled the country and says the army has surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
After declaring that he was receiving death threats, the Prime Minister left with his family to the neighboring South African Republic.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that in reality it was not a coup but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
"This morning, the head of the Lesotho Defence Force acted after receiving intelligence reports that there were several groups within the police planning to arm some radical political fanatics who were about to wreak havoc in the country", Voice of America reported.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has claimed to have seized power by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Force appear to be a coup d'état", he said.
Military officials in the Kingdom of Lesotho said that soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
During Thaban's absence, the Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane stated that in his opinion he is being targeted for his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since Thabane suspended parliament in June over internal disputes, tensions have been running high in Lesotho.
He said that despite the claims to the contrary, his actions do not undermine the government.
Euro area production at 13-month low
Production growth in the euro area slowed to a 13-month low in August, according to a closely monitored survey.
The euro area purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell from 51.8 in June to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 means expansion.
The boom in new orders and factories has been damaged by the growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures are from the quarterly meetings of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want banks to have a clear plan to deal with the euro area's delayed recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB President Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he is considering quantitative easing for the eurozone, similar to that undertaken by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
'Although some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect that a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty has on producers is increasingly visible,'said Rob Dobson, Markit's chief economist.
The manufacturing PMI of Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
Signs that the growth drivers in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands have disappeared are also not very reassuring, said Dobson.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to add fuel to the fire of analysts expecting the implementation of additional monetary or tax incentives.
One positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 'The best thing to say about the August Production Overview of Purchasing Managers is that it shows that the sector is still growing.'
He added: "Manufacturers in the euro area are currently facing a very difficult life, as rising geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - add to the already challenging conditions in many countries even more uncertainty.
This increased uncertainty has evidently affected trade, particularly consumer confidence, and is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially those which are expensive.
He said that it was "even more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to make some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect it to be limited".
Ten years of hell for Beslan survivors: Ten years after the horrors of the occupied school, children are still suffering
Ten years ago, Chechen radicals took a thousand people hostage at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
In the three-day ordeal that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of them children.
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the school massacre.
Exactly ten years after the horrific Beslan school siege that left 334 people dead, including 186 children, last night, heroes of the survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, children and parents were kidnapped and murdered by fanatical terrorists, it seemed like the deepest pit of hell.
The resentment over the tragedy brought East and West together, leading to action and a future in this catastrophic disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan, in southern Russia, to look for some of the victims who had escaped death during the school massacre.
We found some amazing young people who defied the odds, even though the memory of the terrorists' hell will live on in them.
What is their greatest desire?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is over.
A girl trying to get back into the destroyed school gym
It was captured by leading Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov, trying to climb back into a bombed-out school gym in his underwear after a bomb exploded.
Aida, confused, was desperately searching for her mother, Larissa, now in her forties.
There was concern that they were both dead, but in fact they survived.
A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't, Aida said at the time.
My feet were covered in blood.
I got up and I crawled back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several operations, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to have another surgery.
I got some shrapnel in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people the way doctors have helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it has certainly not destroyed it", she said firmly.
It just happened to me, and I can't change that.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed behind.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with our friends.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate, Jera Gapoeva, was killed there.
When we were little, we used to play together and imagine going to school together.
I don't want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about being held captive, but the memories fade a little with each year.
I'm glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we're very grateful for the help we've received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at the picture of me on the Internet climbing through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand this disaster and prevent it from happening again.
The boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, children start school at age seven) and he survived the three-day siege of the school in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At the time, a seven-year-old said: "My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie on the floor and hold her hand".
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him , " Run . "
He was afraid she was dead, so he ran and saw a crying toddler on the way, took the child's hand and ran with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: "Damir told me his mother was dead".
He says, "I couldn't save her".
In fact, Tamara was walking to freedom and lying in the hospital with a broken leg, thinking that her son was dead.
After they met again, she said: "I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World newspaper), where he was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"That fear comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it", he said yesterday.
I can tell you that the memories are fading.
I remember right after that I threw all my guns away for the game.
But now I can play computer games that involve shooting, and I have no problem with that.
I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We never say they were killed or that they died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could pick and choose in the toy store and how I drove a convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine, where the war is making them suffer as much as he and his friends have.
That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I feel very sorry for anyone who has to go through such horror", says Damir, who volunteered at the monastery last week.
I want to help so badly.
I want to work for the police for a while and I hope to get into the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says, "They killed 37 kids from our neighborhood, can you imagine that?
I remember the silence right after the attack, there were no children running around screaming, and the silence lasted for months.
He vividly remembers the trip to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember when Damir had a taste for borscht, and all the Russian restaurants were closed.
I also remember that he played with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir was shooting at them with a water pistol and they ran and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said, "I still think the world hasn't changed for the better in the last ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something on the news that they listen to when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir has grown into a kind and quiet boy, not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he's not interested in this.
I know he doesn't like to think about it, but he's very close to six of his classmates, and he goes to the gym every once in a while and lights candles.
When he was younger, he had trouble with it - I remember sometimes he would lie on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes he would lie there for hours.
He wasn't asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember that he threw out all his pistols or other weapons at play.
I can't believe that for hours I was sure he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and got up, I looked around and saw this hell, pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy had no chance of surviving this hell.
I remember yelling "Damire, run, run!" but I was convinced he didn't hear me.
But he heard her and he ran away.
So our lives go on unlike other people's.
He was a member of the Russian Federation delegation to the Duma.
The boy whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of the horrors in Beslan
Comfort: Beslan survivor Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, right Grigory today
As he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, his bloodied face was stamped with fear.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocities in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day, in a hurry to take her eldest son, Vladimir, to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists stormed the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days", she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date gets closer, it's harder to think about it and talk about it.
Not a day goes by that we don't remember this tragedy.
It doesn't seem like long ago, it feels like yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Recurring memories: The photo of Grigorie (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and has been immortalised as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory was so excited to go to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of a weeping Grigory in San Marino.
Grigory doesn't like to look at that picture, and at home we have it hidden in the bookcase.
I understand that, but I also think that this picture is the way that people all over the world know the pain that we feel.
Today Grigory says: "The important thing is that this does not happen again.
I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Tragedies like this are always investigated, but no one ever knows the truth.
They're investigating the Boeing crash in the Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is about to go bad.
I don't understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants war, so how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
It takes decades to forget a little.
It affected my health, I can still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of the attack, but then it got better.
When I went back to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why, when September 1st comes around, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is in the past.
I won't forget, but I don't regret it.
My life is moving on.
I graduated this year and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health wouldn't let me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
He was a member of the Communist Party.
The boy who survived despite being held at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miracle: Gregori Farniyev was held at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, yet he managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in the gym, sitting next to a bomb at the feet of the murderous terrorist.
It's a miracle he survived.
"It seems like yesterday", said Gregori, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent, but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack, he couldn't.
It's still with me, it's not something I put behind me.
Now that I'm older, they say that children are better at dealing with bad experiences -- I have to say, that's not true.
In 2006, I went to a psychologist and I was a little better, but I can't forget.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005, the year after, that was the first and last time I ever went back to the gym.
I fainted.
I'm never going back there again, and don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting in that famous picture.
Survivor: Gregorij Farniev today, on a laptop with his photograph taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is immense, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as my physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I hurt, but I'm walking normally.
But still, due to health reasons, I couldn't join and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including my medical records, and they told me it was impossible.
My other hobby is animals, so I got into veterinary medicine.
I finished my second year.
They learn how to treat all animals from kittens to cows.
He said, "I know I'll never tell my kids about this.
It's not something that children should know about, and it's certainly not something that they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "The pain will be there all the time.
He's in there, and he's getting worse with the anniversary coming up.
I'll attend the memorial service.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even more powerful for him, because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregori is a grown-up now, but he carries on the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had a few surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say 50% of the time he's over the horror, but you can't get over it and forget it.
This terrible experience will be with us forever.
Many of our friends and neighbors were killed in the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and it's the greatest gift God could have given me, but I'm sorry for the loss of life.
I know families who have had other children, but also widows who have never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want it to.
I'll never forget the way my heart almost leaped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
Now a war is coming to our country, which I can hardly believe.
We used to be one friendly country, so how did we get to fight each other now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If we could just pick up all those rebels and throw them as far as we can.
She was a little girl.
A child who was taken to safety by a special commando
Rescued: Alyona Tskaeva is being taken to safety by Russian special forces (left).
Now ten years old, she has no memory of the tragedy
The world was stunned in 2004 when a Russian policeman carried little Alyona out of the Gheslan prison in his arms.
The terrorists released her, but kept her 30-year-old mother, her 10-year-old sister Kristina, and her brother Makhar captive in the school gymnasium.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister were killed in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and with his new wife Svetlana they have a baby girl, whom they named Kristina after their dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, now ten years old, has no memory of the attack and has grown up to be a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said that they are a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids.
Ruslan is a great father and he wants to keep the kids away from the memories that the tenth anniversary brings.
You can understand why.
Man charged with hitting girl at crosswalk in Fife village
A 78-year-old man is on trial for hitting a three-year-old girl at a sign crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit the girl on the crossing at Pittenween in the East Neuk.
The plaintiffs claim that Stewart did not drive his Audi Q3 with sufficient care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart (78) of Anstruther denied the charges at the Dundee court.
Judge Charles Macnair has set the trial date for January.
4 tips to take better underwater photos and videos
If you are interested in underwater photography or filming, you have a wide choice of equipment.
The most affordable options are compact cameras such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoor camera, which cost around $300.
I took these pictures at a family party with a bunch of cameras, all under $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts are tightly sealed.
Next, adjust the camera according to the type of photos or videos you are going to take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scene or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to a dark underwater environment.
And before you do, figure out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others for 50 to 60.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in both standard and waterproof versions.
Take several pictures at a time - many of them will not work.
Compact cameras have LCDs that help you with photo composition, but outdoor cameras don't.
Even if you have an LCD, underwater, it's going to be hard to see, and the composition of the shot is unpredictable.
So always take more shots.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that takes a series of images with slightly different spread of exposure, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases dramatically as we go deeper.
If possible, keep the water level close to the surface when taking pictures in a pool, lake, or sea.
This also allows you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you dive, the less color you see.
Get close to the subject.
That's great advice if you're shooting on land, but underwater it's even more important because of the dimmer light.
This is especially important if you shoot with an outdoor camera: These devices usually have fixed wide-angle lenses, which means that if you want to fill the frame, you have to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose power of personality could make a difference even in an organisation as vast as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieving the pain of patients suffering from both disease and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the effects of torture that had maimed him.
Lawson realized that while doctors focused on diagnosis and disease, the vast majority of patients were interested in something else entirely: pain.
But one day in 2007, it was he who started to suffer.
"I don't feel like myself", he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He was dealing with flu symptoms and found himself impatient and his wife Juliet covered in guilt.
He noted: "I want everything to be done sooner rather than later".
When Juliet went on a week-long business trip, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
His colleague did a chest X-ray.
Once, two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-rays are back.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the chest or the lining of the lungs.
In most cancers, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients were smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, exposure to asbestos - a fibrous building material once called "miraculous" but now known to be deadly - is the cause.
Most of us didn't have a hard time ignoring mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous form of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960's, when a ban on industrial asbestos came into effect.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people were in close contact with it, such as insulators, builders, carpenters, and shipbuilders.
A toxin used in industry in another era hardly seems a cause for concern today.
But such self-righteousness is not appropriate.
As it turns out, the mesothelioma epidemic in Britain is at its peak today.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year from this disease is twice the number of car accident victims.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason we are only now feeling its effects, despite the fact that the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all forms of asbestos were finally banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for a mesothelioma to develop.
The mesothelioma disaster is not just for veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases still is, present in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops where we shop.
So mesothelioma does not respect social class, wealth, occupation, or age.
Privileged bastions from London's department stores to public schools are no refuge.
Even Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where we should be treated are repositories of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He didn't even put up a fence.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come in contact with the asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It's possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years as a resident", he wrote.
All of them - students, nurses, doctors, and janitors - used the hallways.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he was only able to answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who have been in practice at Guy's Hospital and who have had a mesothelioma in the last five years", he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive".
How many of us are gonna get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
He was 55 when he died on February 17 of this year.
It's not unusual to live with this diagnosis for so long.
Fifty-five percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
Sickness is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us suffer from the same disease?"
According to the leading British expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Pett, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is occurring in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them at this time have no idea that they're going to die this way.
Asbestos mining in Quebec, Canada
A cursory glance at the court records often used by the disabled to seek settlement shows just how widespread the mesothelioma plague has become.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted to negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, overseeing the clothing department in two stores - one of which was the company's flagship store, Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today, she has two children, both in their 20s.
"Before it happened", she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never thought in my wildest dreams that he had anything to do with me.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance but a group of six minerals.
It is named for its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is the most common material found in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals, and even in brake linings.
It is not as lethal as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and WHO consider it to be a 'great health risk' that can cause death.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos and experts say that there is 'convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma in the UK'.
An employee of Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in a flagship store in Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Pet points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that 'a substantial proportion of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment'.
A significant part of this exposure is due to the routine use and ventilation of buildings.
No one seems to be sure that they're safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the middle of government may not suspect that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that found the service elevators and pipes behind the parliamentary committee chambers were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be broken by something as harmless as "a strong current of air".
Ministers are often accused of looking out for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Directorate of Parliamentary Services insisted that Westminster Palace be given a 'full medical certificate', it now expects that it will take £1 million and several years of work to have Parliament thoroughly inspected, the electricity upgraded and asbestos removed, and that after the 2015 elections, MPs will sit in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in compliance with several regulations".
There's no way to tell if this discrepancy will cost lives.
All we can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to determine when he or she was exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos was detected", he says, "but in my case, I can't prove it".
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day in early December 2009 when something like a cold snap took him down.
He was 45, it was evening, and he was in the middle of surgery.
I just got all shook up.
It just came out.
I was so sick.
I thought I wasn't going home in the car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain came from the thorax, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was mesothelioma.
He ended up spending a month at home.
The doctors, confused, gave him a chest X-ray and inserted a chest catheter to remove fluid from his lungs, which they sent to the lab.
They still haven't made a diagnosis.
His condition gradually improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, his symptoms returned, often after he had exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came into the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then, Abbott didn't connect anything to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and had come into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray images with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began feeling ill, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the space between his chest cavity and lung cavity.
I'm an optimist.
I tend to not take anything too seriously, he says.
To be honest, I wasn't too worried about it.
But my wife, Rachel, she was worried.
The biopsy results came back between Christmas and New Year's Day.
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began meeting with the sisters from the Macmillan Charity, and one of them advised him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the extent of the epidemic.
'Asbestos has been found to be widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the piping,' he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now starting to show symptoms.
So now mesothelioma is starting to affect younger people who don't have risky jobs.
The most dangerous pipes insulated with asbestos were in the basements of hospitals, so they were unlikely to endanger patients.
However, staff members who used the basement corridors between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement cafeterias (such as frequently Graham Abbott) were almost certainly exposed to the toxic substance.
As it now appears, for several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where patients' lives could be saved, but they were also a place where the lives of the doctors who treated them could be put at risk.
Asbestos is still being removed today.
Bunsen's students were wearing their Kahans on asbestos mattresses.
And it's not just the hospital.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and city halls because of its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
In schools too.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere, in countless hours, chemistry students were building Bunsen-Kahans on asbestos-based mattresses.
A website has been set up to address the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or the roofs of tool sheds in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
'It's an industrial poison that's been installed in a large number of homes,' notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman with mesothelioma could remember was in the 1970s when a garden shed was demolished.
So be careful how you tear down the garden shed.
With the knowledge that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while to figure it out", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to go away and deal with myself.
Well, I won't be around for another Christmas.
One of the hardest things was to move from being a doctor to being a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling confused by the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all of this", she says.
I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have left?"
I was told 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to make it to Christmas".
That 's right .
Mesothelioma is especially destructive because the very mechanism that keeps us alive -- the very breathing -- is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
The asbestos fibers irritate the larynx and can cause cell mutations.
'The problem is inhaled asbestos fibres in the form of needles,' explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The same hospital where Andrew Lawson was allegedly exposed to asbestos, and which is, paradoxically, the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and has treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos, presumably during their hospital practice.
Asbestos needles enter the lung tissue, Treasure says, and breathing alone pushes them to the edge of the lung where the scaffold is.
It's inherently invasive from the very beginning.
For mesothelioma, the usual treatment options used for other types of cancer don't work as well.
For example, there is heated debate about the effectiveness of surgery.
Some would say it's worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the coccyx", he says.
You can't get past it with a scalpel.
The cancer doesn't respond very well to chemotherapy, which has some effect, but it doesn't cure.
"Once in a while, someone survives lung cancer", says Treasure.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After discovering mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became a one-on-one support and counseling person for people with similar conditions.
When they called, he introduced himself happily, "Hello, this is the cancer center.
"It was very positive", says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months and probably only extend his life by a month.
"I was desperate", he says.
I was gonna give it up.
But Lawson was able to put things in a more optimistic light.
After seeing several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazdusky of the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called them and they examined me", Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a request and then they would have to approve the payment.
For mesothelioma patients, money is key to getting the best treatment available.
But when the various treatments eventually fail, many patients face another financial concern - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they're going to the courts and asking for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of the Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898", says Morgan.
But in the 1960's, it was discovered that even very small amounts of it could pose a health risk.
And here we have the negligence of the corporations.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but according to Morgan, it wasn't a "full settlement" because Lawson couldn't definitively prove that mesothelioma was a consequence of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
But after investigating the case, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that the asbestos in the incriminated basement had been removed in the 1990s.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
The continuous exposure to deadly asbestos in a single business or workplace - usually decades after it happened - has proved to be a huge problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed ownership or gone bankrupt.
The fuse record is missing.
And those who are now defending the charges have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response, important new legislation was passed this year making it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek compensation, even if their former employer cannot be traced.
The law created a $350 million cash reserve paid by insurance companies for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove exposure to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In that case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that would normally be awarded to them as compensation - approximately £120,000.
300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like his mesothelioma patients, thinks that £350 million is "good work".
"It's an agreement written by insurance companies for insurance companies", he says, noting that the amount is a quarter of what the insurance companies would have to pay if time hadn't intervened and people with mesothelioma were able to track down former employers and sue them in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Secretary of State for Work and Social Affairs, admitted that the law had holes in it.
But Penning and Morgan both admit that with seven deaths each year, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering too much and need help now", Penning said last December during the second reading of the mesothelioma bill.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which unlike Tom Treasur, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment, in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a five-year survival rate of up to 40% of patients.
Abbott was empowered.
'Of course, that's not the most important thing,' says Abbott.
You see it all the time with patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott had surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The follow-up examinations showed no signs of disease.
I went for another check in March [2014]
I had several spots [cancers] in my chest.
My 50th birthday was coming up.
It's not life-threatening.
He's up to it.
Abbott had six more cycles of chemotherapy.
At present, there are no signs of a tumor in his body.
But it's a physically and emotionally draining process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security, when I die, or showing my wife how to operate a boiler alarm.
When you hear bad news, you become negative.
You have to look ahead.
As the father of Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) it's not always easy.
"It's hard for the parents", she says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After I was diagnosed, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never grow old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
These are the conversations that all cancer patients have to face.
But in mesothelioma patients, these conversations are not tempered with hope or even a hint of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought Stephen Jay Gould) a joyless certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not life threatening".

During World War II, ships were built in large numbers, and the shipyards were the most exposed to asbestos.
Prohibition of imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal upholds the first successful claim for health damage resulting from exposure to asbestos in Britain.
World asbestos production is increasing by more than 4 213 000 tonnes per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Institute for Health and Safety requires that all suppliers of asbestos have a licence.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited by law in Britain.
In Britain, the use of all forms of asbestos is prohibited.
In the United Kingdom, the Mesothelioma Act comes into force.
A $350 million compensation program is in the works.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, yet in many parts of the world, white asbestos continues to be used as a cheap building material.
World production is held at two million tons a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose its leadership - protesters vow revenge
China's parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite mounting debate on democratic reform.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began organizing and preparing just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress essentially allows the Communist leaders to disqualify any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We were not surprised, but we were outraged", said Democratic Party chairwoman Emily Lau, a lawmaker.
That's not what Peking promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of China's decision, Deputy General Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Fei said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong leadership elections would cause chaos.
Since 1997, when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised that the people will be able to vote for the executive from 2017.
Chinese leaders have touted Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, as it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but it also makes clear that China's leaders are firmly in control of the committee's nominating process, which is tightly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who love the country and Hong Kong will be admitted.
The decision came after the summer months saw some of the biggest and most widely watched protests in Hong Kong in years.
Behind most of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central with Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to close down the financial district unless Beijing grants them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Movement gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the rally, organizers said their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would launch waves of protests in the coming weeks.
They didn't give any more details, apparently to avoid any trouble with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement considered occupying the Centre only as a last resort in case all possibilities for dialogue were exhausted and no other choice was left.
We regret to announce that today all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Centre is inevitable.
Hong Kong authorities spent days preparing for Beijing's announcement, and on Sunday, they reinforced security at the government headquarters, deploying police and barricades.
The instigation of riots is seen by many Hong Kongers as a sign that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There are also growing concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being undermined by the mounting pressure from Beijing.
Some people are criticizing the Occupy Central movement and saying that their demonstrations are endangering Hong Kong's lifeboat.
"The protest they are talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long", says longtime critic of the movement, politician Regina Ip.
We don't want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perceptions could damage the investment.
Chinese state media has also in recent days come up with reports portraying Hong Kong democracy activists as Western-controlled subversive agents.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The campaign?
The League in Jihlava is named after a political movement
The small town of Vysočina is home to approximately 1 600 amateur athletes.
And their top competition is now called the Joint for the Jihlava League.
It's named after a movement that's going into the October municipal elections.
And the top ten candidate is the head of a small mining company in Jihlava, Jan Mráka.
"There was a general assembly where there was no problem", Mráka said.
The situation around the first minor league was already dealt with by the lawyers of Jičlov City Hall and recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
A small dig earned the city about a million crowns last year, according to the city's website.
This year, it's in the hundreds of thousands.
In legal opinion, the procedure of small digging is not contrary to the law or the directives of the magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for the allocation of grants and subsidies", said the spokesman of the Magistracy Radek Tulis.
To draw on city funds and at the same time express a small but firm support in the elections of one political party, that's not going to happen.
There's been no such demand from politicians for high-level "big" football.
It would be the creation of a district division of the ČSSD, an ODS division or a KDU-ČSL 1.
And class and all that competition?
I wouldn't be in favor of it.
On the contrary, I would like to see corporate sponsors turn to us", said the chairman of the regional football association, Miroslav Vrzáček.
The head of the minor football of the other party and the move to the league title will not let
According to the players, this sport deserves its own site in Jihlava with six pitches, changing rooms and social facilities.
"For example, the stadium at Na Stopach is not ours, we are renting it", warned Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
But there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a nonsensical area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava, "he warned Mráka.
The mayor of Jihlava, Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS), reacted that the small mining company uses a playground with artificial grass in Rošického and Na Stoupách streets, which are in the city's property.
We want to build a playground that has maximum use.
We're planning to upgrade or build sports facilities near schools that will be accessible in the afternoons.
I think that for the small bowl, a huge progress has been made in the last few years", he added.
According to Jan Mráka, there will be no more political parties in the names of the leagues.
We have a limit.
If someone from one field enters our partnership, we don't put the other one in", he explained.
"A political move in the name of the league, I consider it an unfortunate move at least", said Karel Voldán, a member of the city's sports commission.
"But let the voters assess whether Mr. Mráka is using the association Malá kopaná Jihlava and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not", he added.
An American tradition is breaking into university life - freshmen can fly jets
We are delighted to be able to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury student travel service in Britain.
To make the best impression of the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 cars.
Stewart also stated that the service has a security aspect.
Servis is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to haul their stuff across the state in a dangerously-loaded car.
We are looking forward to ensuring that our very important freshman (VIF) variants this year will ensure that students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that since the service had just started, there were no reservations yet, but added: "Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks".
The company also stated that, although students pay an annual tuition fee of £9000, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students of 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, students today are different in terms of their expectations and desires - it's more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF programme is the right way to do that.
But the National Union of Students criticized the service as unaffordable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, commented: For most students, such a project is beyond their reach.
Many students entering university this month have to deal with a financial crisis before they can spend thousands of pounds on something as simple as getting into college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep pace with the rising cost of basic necessities.
Feminists are speaking out against racism and police brutality in the wake of the Ferguson shootings.
Earlier this month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed young man.
The attendants at the funeral, with their hands raised, chant: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez has spotted a shift in online discussions by white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prioritize gender over race.
With the rising tensions in the Midwest, which have drawn national press attention, Perez noticed that the white reaction is 100% race-focused.
Compared to the reactions of blacks soon after the August 9th shooting, personal articles with headlines like "White woman thinking about Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
But according to Perez, it represents a major change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who would speak about race and privilege at that level", she said.
People felt they had to speak out about what happened.
It's a characteristic of the crisis that we're facing, because it's so racially biased that they had to bring it up.
According to Koritha Mitchell, an English professor at Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light issues that African-American women face every day that are not seen as women's issues in the cultural realm.
"I can post funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and get 150 likes from people all over the world", Mitchell said.
When I write about colored people being trapped in their own country, it's deafening silence.
'How is it that a woman can speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in public spaces?' she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have been dealing with race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
She said that black people did not have the luxury of dividing up these issues: they lived in this mixed reality every day.
Although white women today are fusing race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched, and the reason for almost all of them was the rape of a white woman, Hattery said.
You needed the cooperation of white women to justify the lynching.
According to Hattery, the split between whites and blacks came when suffragists like Susan B. Anthony surveyed the field in the late 19th century and realized that only one group of people could have the right to vote - women or blacks.
They decided to bet cards on women's right to vote and on blacks' right to focus later, explained Hattery.
Realizing this, we get an important insight into why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a very good job.
We never helped black men protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the vote in 1920, it took a decade for them to start organizing against lynching in the Southern Women's Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after the first black women asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the rise of white feminist responses to the issues that Ferguson brought up - the issue of police conduct, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" on issues that black women had been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists in these spaces [of traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?" Mitchell exclaimed.
The second wave of feminists who made their careers fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now discovering what that means.
Prominent feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown's shooting to Facebook, where they posted a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian, calling for white Americans to protest racism more forcefully.
'I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and views on race that differ greatly in public opinion polls - will strive for change,' wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America confuse some people.
American Enterprise Institute expert Christina Sommers, author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters", but Ferguson's comments face criticism from Steinem's party that she has previously raised.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program called My Brother's Keeper to help vulnerable black and Hispanic youth, it sparked an angry response from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only issue that has come to the forefront of mainstream feminism's attention.
After U.S. border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the Southwest this year, the issue of immigration reform has resurfaced - this time as a woman's issue.
Andrea Mercad, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for immigration law reform, said that in order to present the issue as a women's imperative, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves", says Mercad.
As most work permits are issued to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position of vulnerability to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have resonance in women's organizations", she said.
A pig farm in Ipswich for sale
The real estate agent removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk - when it was posted, it had a pig resting in the living room.
A one-bedroom detached house, for sale for £120,000, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The informational photographs included a picture of a living room in which a pig rests with its head on the sofa.
Connells Real Estate said the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
"The photo was put there by mistake and has since been removed", an office spokesman said.
In the property information, the Connells real estate office described the former prayer house as "a single, detached, one-room cottage".
Although the office has removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house has sparked interest on social media, where some have asked if the pig is included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the town of Harvey, southwest, has a new millionaire.
The lottery player at Harvey wins a million.
With the search for the new millionaire raging in southeast Perth, one lucky guy is going home with $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery draw.
Traffic at Harvey's has won the lottery for the second time in five years, the last time being a $1 million jackpot in November 2009.
The lucky winner has yet to sign up.
Store owner Steve Forward said the win was the talk of the town southwest of Perth.
It's the main theme, and everyone's upset.
We thought a win like that was just around the corner.
The eight winners split one win in Western Australia last month, ending a few lucky weeks.
Last weekend, a Canning Vale player became one of five August millionaires, and just a few weeks earlier, a couple in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been wagering for 20 years and said that the win would enable them to travel the world and buy a new house.
Harvey's millionaire is the 59th and only Western Australian lottery winner this year, with a total of $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains are not running tonight.
The engineers want a raise .
In a press release, the GDL called the protest a warning strike, which it deliberately chose to take place outside of rush hour.
The strike time is chosen by GDL to take into account the many people who return from the weekend by train only during the first working day.
We also think of the people who commute to work during the day", the union said in a press release Monday morning to declare the strike.
"Our first strike should be primarily on freight, less on passengers", added GDL.
DB has not yet released an official response to the strike.
It is not even clear how the protest will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding a five percent increase in the wages of the drivers and a two-hour reduction in the hours worked.
At present, the average salary of train drivers varies between 36 000 and 46 000 euros (998 000 and 1.27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years worked.
DB drivers work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept a pay rise in exchange for shorter hours.
They stress that the wage rates of train drivers must evolve in the same way as for other railway staff, for whom the DB does not count towards the reduction in the working week.
Krest's carriage was about to catch fire.
That's why he finished the Barum rally.
What exactly happened?
It was a defect in the material.
The car was brand new, so I didn't even think that something like this could happen.
Couldn't the exhaust have been temporarily repaired and then continued at a slower pace to the service station where the mechanics would have replaced it?
If we head straight there, we will.
But we had two more erzettes to go, and we couldn't.
It's very hot, and the risk of the car catching fire is very high.
I can't afford to do that.
You've completed five speed tests at full speed.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like a teenager.
We were fast, and I didn't go over the crank.
It was all because we'd been tinkering with the car for over six months to get it to be up to some level.
The race showed we made it.
You drove it so you could think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we could really win.
The work wasn't for nothing.
On the other hand, the outcome we could have imagined didn't come.
But this is Barumka.
Unfortunately, the tech said no.
You weren't the only top player to retire early from the championship game.
The foreign favorites Breen, Abbring and Lappi were eliminated.
Were you surprised to see so many favorites drop out?
I did.
It was a shame for the spectators, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromir Tarabus, whose car you're planning, has been at the top for a long time.
But he paid for it by going off the track and gaining almost two minutes of delay.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could have repeated the winner's stages.
He was a first-time rider.
But Mira also confirmed that we'd fixed the car well.
He was going too fast.
Exactly one year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good feeling from driving make you a regular rally driver again?
Certainly not at this point.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race and I still didn't keep it.
I decided to eat it again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I'll probably go for it.
But that's all I think about.
A lot of people got to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
We started this business partly because of them.
A lot of people, acquaintances and strangers, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's your future after Barumce?
The team's moving on.
Next week we're going to Vyshkov, where Robert Adolf will be racing.
I hope the car didn't get too bad here.
Besides, he wants to borrow the fabia of Honza Sykora for this race.
We're going to the European Tour with Miro in Switzerland and Corsica.
We'll have to start preparing for next year.
Can you give me a hint?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Corsican Rally was part of the World Championship, you reached your best result in the series, fifth place.
Doesn't it tempt you to try the tracks again?
Don't bother.
Oral agreement with the employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you have not had a medical certificate of incapacity for work issued, which serves as proof to the organization that you are unable to perform your duties for health reasons.
And you didn't immediately notify your employer.
Although there was an agreement subsequently that the days in question would be recorded as holidays, the agreement was only oral.
Although the Labour Code does not require that the employer's consent to take leave be confirmed in writing, this has proved to be a practical practice.
If the agreement is only verbal, you have no confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take leave, as in your case, can be denied and absence from work can be considered as long-term unexcused absence, therefore a reason for immediate termination of employment according to § 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a dispute between you and your employer, you will lack any evidence.
But the employment relationship with you was not terminated under section 53, only you have these days listed in the report sheet as unexcused absence.
Unjustified absence from the record sheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the impossibility of receiving material unemployment benefit), but it makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and get a written confirmation that you have actually suffered an accident that has left you incapable of working (this is not called "disability", it is just a doctor's note).
When looking for a new job, you can present this document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate the need for a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, early notification to the employer or the need for written consent to take leave.
You're avoiding any complications that might arise.
Tony Stewart's accident on his way back to the track
The return to the track has come to an end for Tony Stewart just a short distance from the halfway point of the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the road for the second time after his right front tyre burst on lap 172 and the race was over for him.
Stewart drove the wrecked car to the garage, didn't say a word to the reporters, and walked away.
His team principal, Chad Johnston, said the No. 14 team was disappointed, but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, next weekend.
"I wish we had better performance and a better ending", Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope to do better there.
Stewart hit the pavement for the first time in Sunday night's race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required repair on the right side of his car.
"We had hoped for a good finish in today's race", said Johnston, "but it just didn't work out".
Shortly after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to go.
After his car struck and killed another driver at a New York City race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and to do that, he needed to win either the Atlanta race or the following race in Richmond to make up for a spot on the grid.
He returned to racing during the investigation of the tragic accident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who was run over by Stewart during the race.
Authorities say the investigation into the cause of the crash will take at least another two weeks.
There's no word yet on whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion was given a warm welcome before the race.
Stewart started 12th, worked his way up to 10th at the start of the race, and then even to fourth.
Then, at the start of lap 122, Busch's car is spinning.
The 18 got out of control, went off the second turn and hit the Stewarts, sending both cars into a stall.
Stewart continued, but he dropped to 21st.
Prague has selected a new manager for the taxi stand, earning 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection process for the new manager of the taxi service.
103 parking spaces will generate approximately SEK 12,3 million annually.
Not long ago, the same seats for taxi drivers cost 150,000 crowns a year.
This was reported by the councilman Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
In the past, the city used to select trustees by drawing lots.
The winner then received a flat-rate rent of 1,000 crowns a year.
But the rules have changed.
He's currently deciding the bid.
'The year since the termination of the original leases and the opening of tender procedures has shown that the new lease system is far more advantageous for Prague and generally fairer,' say the councillors.
The most expensive spot is on the Pershing
The highest bid was for the building on the street of the Pershyn.
He pays 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid by the new administrators for seats in front of the Town Hall or Wenceslas Square.
The new rules on taxi rental were adopted by the councils in autumn 2012 and the original rental contracts were terminated last summer.
The selection procedure took place in four waves and 29 establishments were selected as new managers.
It's the second time we've had to clean the well this year.
We let it all out each time, which created a second pond around the cabin.
Then we poured the Savo.
The smell is unbelievable!
Our well in the basement always provided plenty of wonderful, fragrant water.
And it wasn't professionally made, Grandpa made it himself.
A long time ago.
It was just a little bit of a three-screw thing and a little bit of a whole lot of stuff, like everything else in the cabin, but I'm saying.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course we ran out of water.
She's been there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, we had a feeling that the water didn't smell.
We were wondering if something had fallen.
The pump was in the wrong place, but the board was not there, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the bricks were moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, and we lit it all the way to the bottom.
So we let it out again and cleaned it up.
Of course, we improved the improvised seal around the pump tube.
We noticed some strange things in the basement.
There was a packed bag of bones on the floor.
At least it seemed that way.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a drooling mouse.
On the ceiling, in the place where the air vents, my grandfather's invention, were the remains of fish!
And it is hard to ride!
Our basement is special too.
Some would say that grandpa just dug up the cabin.
And it wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and floor are all dried sand, only the ceiling is carved.
They mainly go to the boats.
And the bicycles.
And a beach bed.
The wide-spaced door was usually open as someone walked in.
A few of the aforementioned vents on the ceiling.
No net, so it's common for birds to fly in and build nests on the trellises.
There's no need to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to be airy, and it was.
Of course, now the Luft didn't help.
The whole basement stank.
So we cleaned the whole basement.
Especially the fish on the fence was nutritious!
We threw away the things that were around, the planks, the Heraclite plate, and so on.
Our cabin greeted passersby from a distance with disinfectant ointment.
We were wondering who could have planted those disgusting leftovers.
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
She's hardly ever here for lunch.
The heir was attacked by a neighbor who is not well.
What if Franta's the one who put that disgusting stuff in there?
He's been here for a year, and he's got the stupid ideas.
We've decided to keep the cellar and the well under constant surveillance.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using water again, but it was only for washing and laundry until the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling water from a forest well isn't something I've wanted to do for a long time.
Once we heard a terrible, anxious roar of our female.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long, thick black hose in the grass by the porch.
Reza jumped over her and squeaked like a madman.
My mom was yelling at her because she thought Reza had dug up the garbage hose from the sink.
But suddenly, the tube was partially tangled in a knot and partially straightened.
There was a hiss on the balcony.
Reza has had a hysterical attack.
We ran down.
A toad, over a meter long and as fat as a bull, was about to swallow a giant toad, and Reza prevented it from doing so.
It was unclear whether she was trying to save the turtle or whether she was trying to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the worm saw the excess of our family, she thought, "Let's eat it, we're so hungry", and she slipped gracefully through the airway into the basement.
We went after her.
She jumped off the well like a lightning bolt.
By the way, we got another stinky package on her board.
Smells like fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a shambles.
And we locked the basement during the day.
That would...
We went outside and we were all down there, breathing the same air.
We didn't wait long.
The well's got a little bit of a shambles.
First, a flat head with yellow moons on its neck.
Then the whole line of ropes came down to the well.
She rolled around the pump and started to dig in.
The fired employee got revenge, bought the company laptops and sold them
A disgruntled employee bought computers for the company after being fired and then sold them.
He spent the money before the police caught him.
In a short time, the man bought a total of 16 computers in 12 cases for more than $200,000.
"He took the laptops to Olomouc, where he sold them at bazaars", said Rostislav Brückner, the chief commissioner of the police in the city of Šuměří.
The motive of the frauds was to take revenge on the employer for the dismissal and also to make money.
"He told us during interrogation that he used the money to repay loans", Brückner said.
Police also determined that the fraudster was a pathological gambler who had been treated repeatedly in psychiatric institutions.
The money could also end up in slot machines or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money on him", the commissioner said.
A fraudster who had previously been convicted of theft now faces a prison term of one to five years.
Police have not yet said whether the bazaars that bought and sold the laptops at a discounted price are also at risk of punishment.
"It is true that they were taking brand new goods, which is suspicious to say the least", the Commissioner noted.
But none of the owners of the bazaar have been charged.
Come on, just a little bit more, you can do it or I'll have a We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have made some changes for us.
The biggest was the change of route, which brought the target to the waterfront instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it from a different perspective.
We decided to personally greet our readers at the booth with the entire team, and we took pictures and made videos together.
To perfect my view from the other side, I have taken on the role of a personal guide.
My friend Katya and I were obediently lined up at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted our friends as they passed us into the faster runners' sector.
There wasn't much time left.
A couple of warm-up jumpers, turn on the sports tester, countdown and go!
Shouts of jubilation, but instead of a quick start, followed by a whimper to the starting line.
After five minutes, we're at the gate, I'm turning on the gauges, and we're going at a 10-hour pace.
We are intertwined with a yellow snake of runners, who, like Katya, are running their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, the slowly falling sun in the sky adding to the view of Vyšehrad an almost quivering air.
The pulsating flesh pulsing along the waterfront looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
On the waterfront between Vysehrad and the National Theatre, the traditional show of strength begins.
A slight hill on Palacký Square forces many runners to slow down or switch to walking.
Just before the Theatre overpass I see a police escort and right behind him Vítek Pavlišta is flying at an incredible pace to the finish line.
I hear the admiring, hoarse sighs of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's about to slap me, but just before that my leg snaps and our hands are about to pass.
Running through the Theater Street gives you a chance to take a short break and catch your breath.
There are places ahead of us that will take my breath away.
A turn on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in all its beauty at sunset.
I'm not breathing, and my legs are barely holding me.
The first snack is the moment of truth.
When crossing the road, Katya slips on the curb and performs a swimming jump.
I see if she needs help, and I start a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about the pain.
He gets up and we continue down Goat Lane, it's one of the narrowest places on the track, at this stage of the race there's not as much of a rush, but still, you need to keep a good eye on the surroundings.
I don't know yet that the term "closest place" will take on its true meaning later.
Behind the Dust Gate, we're frantically cheered by tourists and fellow runners.
I try to clap with anyone who offers a hand, and I tell Kate to do the same, because ten claps with the fans is like half a power bar.
It's working, we're picking up speed again, and even though we've fallen off quite a bit, we've just started the chase.
We pass dozens of runners, and when I pass someone who is especially tired, I try to encourage him by saying, "Come on, just a little bit more, you can do it!"
We're not getting beat by the last snack bar, so we're speeding up.
We've been running for an hour and a quarter, we add, there's no waiting.
Two miles to the finish line will hurt, but you have to really push.
The sun is slowly setting and the end of the day is symbolically slowly ending the race.
Last pass to the bridge, turn, and just straight to the finish line.
The way we're running, I wonder where this girl is coming from.
"Come on, we're going to the 13th hour, we're working!" I call.
We try it, we sprint, and here's the finish.
One hour, thirteen minutes, six seconds.
Well, what can you do?
Coach set the limit at 1 hour and 20 minutes.
So, seven minutes behind schedule.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Katya's legs are paralyzed, I help her to the railings, where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from a well-done performance.
After a while, I slowly lead her out of the target area.
Euphoria doesn't make us think of crowds in the dressing rooms.
You can see here that the Goat aisle wasn't the narrowest place.
This is the end of the runway, which is under the weight of nearly 10,000 runners crammed to bursting.
If someone doesn't like crowds, this is no place for them.
After a while, I lose my head and wonder if the beautiful views and the more interesting route compared to years ago were worth what was happening at the finish line.
I know from experience that running a race is no fun.
If you add 10,000 people, a rich support program, and closing down the entire center of Prague to all traffic, it's a huge challenge.
This year's change of course has shown runners many interesting places, but it has also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The great atmosphere of the Yellow Baths was felt by the runners and the race itself.
Organizers around the track and casual spectators were cheering her on every inch of the way.
Unfortunately, running through the historic center of the city has its obstacles, which cannot be removed, but the goal of a mass race in a place that is bordered on one side by a wall and on the other by a river, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with a finish, I rate it as very successful.
I was a little concerned about the health of the people involved, but it all worked out fine.
Write to the discussion if you liked the route and what you think about the situation in the destination.
Prison guards in Bulgaria are organizing protests
Hundreds of prison service employees across Bulgaria participated in a nationwide protest rally outside the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the restoration of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
Among the demands to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov, are higher salaries.
The supervisors had been protesting against the new working hours for a month, demanding a return to the original 24 hour shifts.
Although prison guards' unions and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not reach an agreement, reported Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
'Negotiations are still ongoing,' said Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate of Prison Service.
The prison service workers' protests are expected to be joined by members of the Federation of Labour Unions of the Ministry of Interior.
Why can the universe have multiple dimensions and we can't see them?
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University did a hit in 1999.
His book Elegant Universe became the most accessible way for laypeople to penetrate the myriad of problems that many theoretical physicists are dealing with today - the attempt to unify two brilliantly working but incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and general relativity.
One reason for the success of Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that it's not a boring story in the search for a unified physical theory.
Physicists have solved the fundamental problem between the two key theories (for at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and they have solved it so ingeniously that it is worth re-telling to the layman.
Greene also handled complex material with such freshness and fascination that it is hard to fault him for not including much of it in his book.
Moreover, he largely corrected his "mistake" in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and The Hidden Reality.
I suppose the author himself wouldn't mind his book becoming obsolete more quickly, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with the ambition to understand the world should know about this important piece of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years, the field will be a little more lively (perhaps because the LHC accelerator will finally go "full throttle"), and so it is a good time to enter the door of the world of modern physics, which Green has opened non-violently.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may certainly sound foolish, fantastic, strange or mystical.
Yet it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our gaze for a moment from the universe as a whole to something more mundane, namely, a long, thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that you are pulling a 100-foot garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and observing the entire scenery from a distance of a half mile [a half mile] away (as shown in the picture and on the following page).
From that distance, you can easily see a long hose stretched horizontally, but unless you are suffering from a cleverness, you can hardly tell the thickness of the hose.
Given its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
If someone asks you where the ant was at that moment, you will answer with only one piece of information: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the tube.
All we're saying is that from a distance of a half mile, a long piece of pipe looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, a snake is thick.
If we zoom in, we suddenly see a second dimension -- a circle around a tube.
In this magnified view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the well-known left-right dimension along the length of the tube, but also in the "clockwise/clockwise dimension", around the circular cross-section of the tube.
You're starting to understand that to locate the little ant, you have to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the loop that encloses the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the tube is two-dimensional (note that this chapter focuses purely on faulty string theory.
Non-disruptive aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is shown by a straight arrow, the circumferential dimension, shown by a circular arrow, is short and concave.
There is, however, a clear distinction between the two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The diameter of the winding of the hose circuit is short, 'twisted' and hardly noticeable.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a much better resolution.
This example illustrates an important property of spatial dimensions.
They're splitting into two groups.
They can be large, extensive, and therefore directly visible, or small, convoluted, and much more difficult to observe.
Of course, in this case we didn't really go out of our way to reveal the "closed" dimension of the thickness of the wrapping hose.
You could have used a telescope.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - the dirty dimension would only be revealed with great effort.
Kaluza sent Einstein a paper in 1919 in which he floated the startling idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions known to us all.
Kaluza justified his radical claim by arguing that the extra dimension provides an elegant and compelling framework within which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question immediately arises as to how this observation of Kaluza fits in with the obvious fact that we see three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly stated and specified by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and curved dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension of the length of the tube, our universe has a large, expansive, easily visible three-dimensional world that we are aware of at any given moment.
But, analogous to the circular circuit of a garden hose, the universe may have additional dimensions, tightly folded into a space so tiny that it has so far remained hidden from our most sophisticated experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer picture of the nature of Kaluz's remarkable design, let us stay with the hose for a moment.
Imagine that you draw a relatively dense row of circles on the perimeter of the hose in black.
The needle looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope, we can now use the drawing to reveal the dirty dimension even more easily, as we can see the motif in figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, which together make four spatial dimensions.
It's difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, notice the illustration in Fig. 3, which shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In this picture, we're magnifying the geometry of the space in the same way that we magnified the surface of the hose.
Each succeeding level represents a huge expansion of the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe can have extra dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they're confined to a small enough space; that explains why we haven't observed them directly yet.
The square grid represents the familiar "big" dimension, while the circle represents the new, tiny, dirty dimension.
Just like loops of thread in a tightly woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of ordinary dimension - we've only drawn them into the intersections of the square grid for the sake of illustration.
The background of Figure 4 depicts the familiar structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such commonplace measures as meters, denoted by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each subsequent image, we focus on a small area of the previous image; we magnify it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we can see in the first few levels of magnification.
But as we move on our journey beyond the microscopic features of the geometry of space - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, circularly twisted dimension, like a thread in a thickly woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions in much the same way that a hose has a circular circumference at every point along its length.
For the sake of illustration, we have drawn the circular dimension in only a few regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kalus and Klein's view of the geometry of space as a microscopic structure.
The similarity to the hose is obvious, although we also note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-flung spatial dimensions (of which we've only drawn two), whereas the hose has only one large dimension.
And the more important difference is that we're talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the extra circularly curved dimension is extremely miniature, it is much harder to recognize - like the circular circuit of a hose - than to observe the obvious, large and expansive dimensions.
If the size of the extra dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the power of our most advanced magnification instruments.
Most importantly, the extra dimension is not just a curved bump inside the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration falsely suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of the three common extended dimensions.
It's independent of the other three dimensions, just as the top-down, left-right, and front-to-back dimensions are independent of each other.
A sufficiently small ant would be able to move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data points, in addition to the usual three positions in the circular dimension; if we include time, then five data points, in any case one more than we would normally expect.
Did you care?
The book "Elegant Universe" by Brian Green can be purchased here at books.id.cz.
The price of the e-book is 149,- CZK.
So to our surprise, we find that even though we are aware of only three dimensions of space, Kaluza and Klein's reasoning shows that it does not preclude the existence of additional reduced dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe may well have more dimensions than we can see with our naked eye.
How small should they be?
The most advanced technology can detect structures as large as a billionth of a billionth of a meter.
The smaller, more twisted dimensions can hardly be observed.
In 1926, Klein combined the original idea of Kaluza with several ideas from the nascent quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the extra circular dimension could be about one Planck length, a size far beyond the resolution of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions the Kaluzov-Klein theory.
Homol's advice on how to practice electric guitar: part 5.
The whole point of the twelve is that it's a twelve-bar harmonic form that you can repeat as you like.
For those who are new to music theory, the principle of music theory is explained in detail here.
Jan Homola also known as Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
A trained puppeteer and puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be seen here, has been making a living as a graphic artist since graduating high school 20 years ago.
He's the guitarist of the band Wohnout, which, unfortunately, they say, is impossible to leave.
He's a guitarist, like his father, and his brother, Matt, is a leader of the Wohnhout.
Start your training on one string.
"The rhythm model is up to you, you can come up with anything, then just apply it to the harmonic model of the twelve", advises Honza.
When you add another string, you can reverse the figure again.
All you have to do is listen and watch Honza, what he can do with a 12-bar harmonica on two strings and how beautiful it's starting to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can flirt with the melody of some songs.
When you finally add the fourth, watch for a change in pitch, says Honza in the video.
Next time Honza goes back to the pentatonic, you try to get it right with the twelve.
Then practice it honestly.
At best, you'll read it in an interview with Jan Homola at his first lesson in the school of electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not much of a celebration, says the man in the castle
We're taking the points and we're happy for him.
"We had more chances in the first half, the second home team", said the striker, who scored from the penalty kick.
You weren't nervous playing it, after all, it was accompanied by a huge whistle?
I didn't feel like it, although it would have been worse on the other side, where the home fans are.
You had a penalty to tie after half an hour, but you also had a goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What's wrong?
We were asleep at the beginning, we were passive, it became a horn and then a penalty.
You were the better team, the team that had more chances in the first half.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that after the goal, we played well until halftime.
We said in the booth we wanted to keep the pace of the game after that, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it's also probably true that the home team had something to say about their game at halftime, and they weren't very happy with it.
You've scored on the opposing team's court for the first time, while you haven't scored a goal at home yet.
Why is there such a difference?
I don't think it's that much of a difference, but it's more a matter of how we deal with it.
We started well in the Gate, but then we were bad, Plzeň, that's another category.
Four games you've been waiting for a goal, weren't you worried that after the last game it might be like this?
I don't think so, but of course we're glad we don't have to listen to the talk of waiting for a goal since the last game.
Now we've added another one without waiting, but it's still three in six games, which is not a big celebration.
- Island lava flows from a mile away crater.
Lava flows to the surface in the Holuhraun area near Vatnajökull glacier, and flows through an underground tunnel from a crater a kilometer away.
It's under the glacier, as is part of the underground lava tunnel.
This is the fact that scientists are most concerned about right now...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still comes out of the crack with about the same amount of lava.
However, the quantity is lower than originally estimated, not 1000 m3, but 'only' 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is 50 times larger.
But scientists are concerned that lava tunnels could open up in places where they are under the ice.
If that were to happen, and with the intensity of the present eruptions, it would mean huge flooding, both on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum and on other rivers.
The eruption is surrounded by a strong sulfur smell, and clouds of steam and gas are rising from the fissure.
It is certainly not a tourist-friendly eruption, as was the case with the Fimmvörðuháls eruption in 2010.
This is much larger and there is also much more gas", says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
But the weather has improved since yesterday, with a near-zero wind in the area in the early hours.
The sandstorm trail was washed away by rain.
The scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange (second highest) rating applies to Bárðarbungu and the yellow (third) rating applies to Askju.
The sky above Cheb was the brave Lady Peggy.
She 's gone through the wings
A flight day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17, flight acrobat Peggy Walentinova introduced herself, climbing out of the cockpit to the notch on the upper wing of the biplane and also between the wings.
There it relies solely on muscle strength.
This year's Chebu Air Day was the fifth, and the organizers have once again managed to put together some interesting aerial pieces.
The premiere of the oldest Czech airport was not only the "walk on the wings" performed by German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also the legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or the Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He drew attention to himself with his radiant haircuts.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the United States.
After World War I, many former war pilots tried to do so.
But due to the high number of fatal accidents, it was banned.
But today, he's slowly returning to the Air Days program.
Peggy will climb out of the cockpit onto the upper wing after takeoff.
He's doing a lot of exercises there.
At the end of the performance, she moves to the space between the wings of the plane, where her show continues", described Luděk Matějíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the highlight of the program, then the subsequent Mustang performance was the icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter on the surface joined the Grippena of the Army of the Czech Republic in a tail (the so-called on the numbers).
Such a setup was the first time that aviation fans in the Czech Republic could see.
The pilot, Miroslav Sázawski, then performed a breathtaking stunt with a plane from 1945.
It was made during the war, but it probably never took part.
He was in the Army Reserves.
He has been active in the civil sphere since 1963.
As a racing plane.
Today, he has his home hangar at Munich Airport.
In the same place is another pearl of Cheb Aviation Day, the twin-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, a massive machine couldn't be missed.
Its polished aluminum veneer glowed into the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of the French Air Force has also won admiration.
A small transport plane jumped behind the abandoned Turbolet and from the German Hof brought part of the German delegation on the flight day.
The German neighbors in Cheb showed off their reconstructed Yak 18T aircraft or a three-man formation of Bücker Jungmann biplanes.
Lucie Borhy: A dramatic return to the camera!
Lucie Borhy has swapped her parental concerns for her work concerns, at least for tonight.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde presenter obviously knows none of that.
She was doing so well moderating the TV news, it was like she hadn't stopped with him in two months!
It's only been two weeks since the blonde finished her sixth trimester, which is the most stressful time for women after childbirth.
Lucie will not be regularly featured on TV Nova's main news programme.
She's not due back for a month, according to Blesk.com.
Her daughter Linda needs her more than the TV audience does right now.
Lucie Borhy returned to the television screen and it was a hit in black.
A year's exhibition in Prague?
Hala would sell herself, she's planning a going-away party
It would be dignified if something like this happened during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union stands", he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called Golden Match, in which the amazing Nagan team met again.
Even the players who participated in the golden hat trick.
The players would be hungry, right?
I'm sure you do.
It would just be nice to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
I think you can find a day or two during the tournament when it's totally off and where a game like that could be played.
We'll tell Gum or Bedi, who will take care of it.
The arena would be sold out.
But what if you play New Jersey in the playoffs?
So when I get there...
You don't want to play for the national team.
Or did the South Summit change your mind?
Representation and exhibition match are two different things, and in representation, the performances are the decisive ones.
It's one thing that people would love to see me there, but the performances are the deciding factor, especially at the World Championships.
It's where the players who can do it should go, not because they have a good reputation.
My decision hasn't changed.
How did you enjoy your Nagan reunion?
Just meeting the players was great.
You've brought the stories to life and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was to honor Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and that a generation is leaving that really stood out.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimir Rózsicka and Petr Čechmánek are on the other side.
Do you remember your first national team match?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against the Calgary Flames, and three young men, me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, were in a three-way.
It was the first national team start for all of them.
But we're not going to dominate in any way.
In Jihlava, Dominik Haszek was caught after a long time.
What did you think of his performance?
The Hasan on the ice never surprises me.
I wanted to give him back with that criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jagr for the reasons why he decided to end in the national team).
Hnilichka did a great job too.
And yet he was with me one night in training, and he was all holes.
And now he's got a big one.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, the players start qualifying
The NH Hotel in Smíchov was crowded with prominent guests on Monday morning.
People could see the goalkeeper Peter Čech from Chelsea, the national team coach Pavel Vrba...
And that figure over there in the black hood, that's Tomáš Rosický!
The Arsenal midfielder and the captain of the national team arrived at the meeting around half past the last.
We're going to have a beautiful match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said, as he stood before the press in a representative outfit.
Czech national team programme
Monday 1 September: start of the meeting, first practice
Tuesday, September 2: Open practice for the fans at 6:30 p.m. and the autographs at 8 p.m.
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15 in the summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of the clash
Rosicki and Co. can get their fans to cheer before Wednesday's game against the U.S. (20:15).
The team has opened practice for them on Tuesday, which starts at 6:30 on the weekend.
And then there will be an autograph session, which neither Rosicky nor Czech will miss.
Otherwise, this national team meeting will be more peaceful.
Which is a compliment to Coach Vrba, who was just complaining about the amount of social events this spring.
We're finally gonna do what we want to do.
We're going to focus on the Netherlands now.
It's an advantage to have players for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that we haven't had time to do so far", said Vrba, who has officially been in charge of the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will enter the new qualification cycle with a Musketeer's image.
The Nationals have three games under the tree, all pre-game.
She drew 2-2 with Norway and Finland and lost 1-2 with Austria.
But these results were not yet important.
Not until now.
The match against the Netherlands will start the qualifying for the European Championship 2016.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if they could handle the general against the United States.
The first half of the year was to get to know each other.
Now it's the results that matter.
We have to think about it to be successful", agreed the Vulture.
The only player in the 23-man roster with a medical condition is forward David Lafata.
He's having a little heat stroke.
If he didn't recover in time for Wednesday's game against the U.S., Coach Vrba would have called in another forward.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman in Britain describes how for many years, after a misdiagnosis, she thought she was going to die.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence believing she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that affect nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK has stated that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, as very little is known about the disease.
It is estimated that about 23,000 people in the United Kingdom suffer from CMT, which can manifest itself in motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, sloppy walking and twisted toes.
In addition, patients may experience numbness or pain, a condition that is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she had Friedreich's ataxia (FA), a disease with a very poor prognosis.
She believed that by the time she turned 18, she'd be in a wheelchair, and dead by the time she turned 30.
A mother of two, now 51, says: "As a child, I knew I could not do the same things as others.
Every day I fell, and everything took longer.
I was never allowed to skateboard or skate with the other kids, and I was bullied at school for walking and running.
When Rodgers was 13 and had several operations to relieve her Achilles tendon and straighten her foot, she took advantage of her doctor's leaving the room to look in her medical records and learn that she had AF.
"I felt guilty about snooping, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up the information on the disease in the library and wrote to the FA", she says.
When they answered, I was shocked, completely panicked.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by the time I was 18, dead by the time I was 25, and losing all my powers in the process.
I was all alone and I was planning my funeral.
When she was 17, she realized that her walking ability had not deteriorated as much as she had expected, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, "Honey, I don't think you have the disease, or you'd be in a wheelchair by now".
I think it's going to be something a lot less life-threatening.
After undergoing several genetic tests, it was determined that she had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky kid", she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of the disease.
Washington area business owners: As the economy turns, taxes rise
A growing economy means more customers, more sales and more jobs.
And higher taxes too.
According to a new survey released last week, state and local corporate taxation in a country accelerating economic recovery has increased slightly in the past year, and Washington companies are no exception.
Businesses in Maryland and Virginia combined for fiscal year 2013 to the state and local treasuries collected $27.6 billion, a 3.8 percent increase over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden - state and local - rose 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent last year, and the third consecutive year of growth after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were falling.
According to a study by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3%, than local taxes, by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56%, is from the business tax, and 36% of Maryland's revenue is from corporations.
Virginia, at 28%, has the lowest proportion of business tax revenue.
Researchers say that the majority of the tax revenue growth comes from increases in the value of property owned by companies, which has increased property taxes by 3.7% this year for three consecutive years with growth of -1%.
Although most of the profit comes from large states like California, New York and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012, a year-over-year increase of 4.2%.
But the apparent increase in property values does not drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes account for less than one-fifth of corporate taxes.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the estate tax accounts for almost half of state and local taxation.
"Many real estate in Maryland is owned by businesses, primarily tax bases in the D.C. area, the government or non-profits that don't pay taxes", explained Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on, say, income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent rise in business tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to a recovering real estate market.
The data also shows that business income is increasing.
Companies in the region posted $2.3 billion in corporate income tax, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected one billion dollars in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs does not grow in these three places at the same rate.
The growth rate in D.C. was on par with the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, at 4.9%.
Only Virginia had a below average tax increase of 4.1 percent.
Of the three counties (all of which have the same taxation), Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate, 6%.
Maryland's corporate tax rate is 8.25%, while D.C.'s average remains relatively high at 9.975%.
A similar study this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and an overall more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed legislation reducing corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the State continues to meet its revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to up to 3% in 2017.
A recent study found that small businesses in Washington D.C. are doing better, and therefore are paying higher state and local taxes.
The small business income tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax - the cost-to-income structure under which most businesses are organized - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than any other tax.
The researchers claim that the trend and the nationwide increase in the business tax is likely to continue next year, with total sales tax revenues for state and local governments increasing to 6.2% compared to the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
But Washington may be lagging behind the others, because cutting government spending takes its toll on the labor market.
What you missed: the boss of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorossiya and Lafat's scissors
Will a new state be created in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novorussk.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government forces have been battling pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that they would have difficulty returning to the Russian market under the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions.
He is a former Deputy Chairman of the 'People's Council' of the 'Donetsk People's Republic'.
He says the end of the conflict is up to Kiev, so he can't say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
Another sanction for Russia?
The Czech Republic claimed the right to disagree with part of the
The European Commission and diplomats are to propose a form of further tightening of sanctions against Russia within a week, the EU summit decided last night.
This was stated by the permanent chairman of the member countries' meetings, Herman Van Rompuy, to the press.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for the move in the form of sanctions are to be ready as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new union president.
Van Rompuye will be replaced in December.
At the European Union summit, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected as the head of the European Council, the so-called EU presidency that runs the summits of the member states.
He's taking over from Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
Catherine Ashton will be succeeded as head of European diplomacy by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian, who will become the next Vice-President of the European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, but it's not talked about
To help an incurable and long-suffering patient with a death wish?
In Czech conditions, where the laws do not allow euthanasia, it is not legally possible.
Nevertheless, doctors who have spoken to LN have said that they have heard such requests.
ALS: The Hardest Chapter of Neurology, says a doctor about MS
About 300 people in the Czech Republic suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and 21 patients are undergoing an experimental stem-cell treatment at Motol in Prague.
We don't know for sure if it's going to be successful.
But if we don't try, we won't know", says Radim Mazanec, a neurologist from the city of Motol.

Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are coming up and the parties are offering the impossible again.
No more homeless on the streets, parking for every family and a cable car over Prague.
It's the same story every election: the parties make impossible promises.
Also, with the municipal elections approaching, politicians are racing to see who the voters like best.
Lidovky.cz has selected unfulfilled promises from the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechs landed at Dunkirk.
The siege is under way.
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak separate brigade moved to France.
Its commander, Alois Liška, constantly asked for technical equipment and for a deployment to the front.
The British eventually relented and incorporated this ground unit as one of their forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in the hands of German troops.
Plzeň leads the league ahead of the Prague "S", Liberec declassified the Minik
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, leading by one point ahead of both Prague "S".
The change in the leader of the table was caused by the defeat of Slavie 1:2 in Mladá Boleslav.
After two defeats in the home league, Sparta recovered, thanks to two strikes by Lafat, she defeated Jablonec.
The record win of the year was attributed to Liberec, who scored a 6-0 win over Ostrava Miner.
62,000 people at a volleyball game?
The Poles say yes
The opening ceremony of the World Volleyball Championships in Warsaw brought a record number of spectators.
In a football stadium under a covered roof, 62,000 spectators watched the home team's smooth victory over Serbia.
The tickets sold out in 100 minutes.

Joan Rivers' family: We are holding our fingers
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since being brought to a New York City hospital, but her daughter said today that she is not losing hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support", Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had suffered a cardiac arrest at Yorkville Endoscopy on the Upper East Side, the source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her sedated and under close supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains "serious".
Reactions have been swift, including incredible online support from the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is twisted headlines
That the media distorts reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) not news.
I know that headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, more appropriately called "annoying".
This is particularly true of articles on the Israeli-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip.
It's common to see headlines like "Israel attacked Gaza".
Only in the text do you read that the Israeli "attack" was a response to the firing of rockets from Gaza, often in times of declared ceasefire.
That's when the headline appears "Both sides violated the ceasefire".
Does the press community realise that by doing so, it is directly contributing to the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing across Europe (and beyond)?
It has been less than 60 years since the end of World War II.
There are people alive today who survived the Shoah.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany where the crowd shouted the slogan "Jewish pigs" and similar superstitions, I was stunned.
Is this the world that wants to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Are our journalists aware of the fact that after the Jews, they were destined to exterminate the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care in your work.
You're often referred to as the "watch dog of democracy".
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its own people.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided to eliminate the Czech nation and erase the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
There is another fact that you may also want to consider.
Almost 20% of the Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the territory of the State of Israel.
And they're happy there.
If you ask them why they don't go to their own people, like Gaza, they'll tell you why they would do that.
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and top-notch healthcare (I have seen first-hand how the top-notch Hadassa private hospital, which is funded by donations from Jews from all over the world, is a regular Arab destination and, of course, they are treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help to Gaza, and therefore to this troubled region, is to get rid of Hamas and disarm it.
And not condemn Israel, even if it's not in the headlines.
Inform them of the practices of Hamas, of its use of people as human shields.
Inform them that Hamas aims to destroy the State of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the lives of innocent Arab children.
Inform them that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Inform them that in nine years of self-rule in Gaza, this area has been able to flourish thanks to humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity, which the Gaza authorities do not pay for, and are even annoyed that the power is interrupted at times.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels to allow suicide bombers to enter Israel, but in the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers in Gaza would have been much better off.
Amazon is buying Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed the claim of Information Monday morning: The Internet retailer - producer of videos and hundreds of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion.
The announcement was a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because it was expected that YouTube would be the buyer.
Three months ago, it seemed like a sure thing that Twitch would sell to Google for a billion dollars, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago by Justin.tv, was on track to become a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to stream live video games online - in the words of Business Insider, "YouTube for live video games".
The Twitch interface.
There are already popular videos on YouTube called "Let's play", the kind where the wise men (mostly elderly) give the play to the Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes across as a lot of shock when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch didn't really excite anyone, it was a textbook example of how an established company pays off potential competition.
The mystery is why the YouTube deal didn't work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have available at the moment is the statement of the CEO of Twitch, Emmet Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our company, share the same values and long-term vision and want to help us achieve it faster".
Another mystery is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who claim to do sports rather than watch them, it's hard to understand what's so great about watching games instead of actually playing them.
It's one thing to watch your friend over your shoulder playing Resident Evil at 3:00 in the morning, and it's another thing entirely to watch a complete stranger get 20 shots to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you might be watching right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit, speed-running games, in which Roger Bannisters of our electronic age finish the game in record time, is fun.
But unless someone is a master of gaming or humor, their Twitch channel is probably not going to be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about that?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visitors and is the fourth-highest traffic site on the Internet.
How exactly does Amazon use that?
It's hard to imagine Twitch blending into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have swallowed it.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitch CEO Shear said, both Amazon and Twitch believe in the future of gaming, and the media doesn't seem to be shying away, nor are they - swallowed - by the audience.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by the American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time the theme is "The Scriptures Are the Word of God".
The original video is attached.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by actual human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that contradicts their religion, they often ask us the question, who will you believe?
The supposed word of God or the word of man?
As if human inquiry were nothing compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine has.
Except when they say "man", they're talking about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God", they refer to myths about God written by men.
If there is an intelligent creator with a purpose, then it is he who created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who devised the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who has provided the other lines of evidence that point exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion in the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he's trying to tell us something!
Humans couldn't have created any of those things.
But people can tell stories, they can tell stories.
And it was the people who wrote all the texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every so-called holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not by gods.
People who were "driven" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictation of angels, but the texts were written by no one but mere mortals with a certain amount of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all the religions, a supra-galactic super-genius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a being of your size ever wrote a book, there would be only one book, one holy book.
It would be known throughout the world, without precedent, parallel, or alternative in any language, because mere human authors could not measure up to such a work.
And people would not have to blindly believe it, for it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and reveal a deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would inspire each reader to a unity of common faith.
If God wrote it, we'd expect nothing less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of one religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions with no common origin, all of which are constantly breaking up into more and more separate denominations, seeking conflicting truths and each claiming somehow divine guidance, despite continued disunity and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Koran, Baha'u'llah's Kitáb-i-Akdas, the Zoroastrian Avesta, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharat's Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, and the Urantia Book are all considered to be "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the one true god", and the respective believers in each of these say that the others are in error.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is misguided to some extent.
None of the above books has any advantage over the others.
None of them have any evidence, and none of them can be confirmed historically.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I'm not saying that I've proven the Bible to be reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it's not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and apology, because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities, and primitive notions once considered true but now overcome.
So they cannot be said to be evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them advocate heinous atrocities instead of morality, and many of them claim to be confirmed by fulfilling prophecy - with each one also containing prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore subject to the interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudiced, politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in those books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, but rather a mutual comment.
We have to point out again that we have two different authors here whose work has been somehow mixed together in some editorial review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not an eyewitness account!
Some scholars now distinguish four different sources for the Pentateuch alone, the five "Books of Moses", and do not attribute authorship to Moses in any of them, since he almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered at the same time, and they're all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological findings of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druidic cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity started as a gnostic faith, followed by the docets and the Ebionites and their very different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a sort of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups like the Luciferians were discredited and discredited by further Bible revisions.
One of these records relates to King Ugarit, who ruled over 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young Moshiach religion, the New Testament authors decided to ridicule and change Ba'al Zebul, "Lord of the Mountain", to Beelzebub, "Lord of the Flies".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining portion of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in a series of commission decisions at the Council of Nicaea.
Four gospels were accepted and 16 others were rejected by a simple show of hands, as if the fact of a matter could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon developed depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers of the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem church?
And what about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they found that they were getting closer to the same gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon developed from the heart of the early church.
So the Council simply accepted as gospel any relevant stories that were circulating among the uneducated masses of the time.
But they also deliberately withdrew more than ten books of the Bible, even though they referred to the books that had been approved.
Among the rejected items are writings of both apostles and prophets.
Why should God's Word refer us to books that are only the words of some men and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved if God was the real author of this haphazard mixture of legends, parables, and psalms?
The Bible was certainly written by men and not by the very enlightened, quite the opposite!
That's why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, be it almost anything from beginning to end.
We're talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could talk, who believed in spells, blood offerings, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology and the five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic wand to sprinkle blood on someone, it would cure him of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought that rabbits were ruminants and bats were birds and whales were fish and pi was a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed a pregnant cow the stripes, she would give birth to a stripe calf.
How could someone who knows something about genetics say that?
The authors of this book, of course, did not know that.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the errors it does.
If it had come from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would contain nothing at all of what it contains.
It fails completely as a moral guide because, for the most part, the original Hebrew scriptures were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who condoned or encouraged cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave exploitation, domestic abuse, child abuse, child abuse, abortion, looting, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
To justify their inhumanity by claiming to do God's will.
But creationists still ignore all of this.
Some of their Web sites admit that if any fact conflicts with the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
Why would you?
Because if creationists didn't have their favorite books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, one is the same as the other.
Ironically, they reject God's "work" as "worshiping the creation instead of the Creator".
But they themselves regard the word of man as the word of God and of God himself, and even insist that the rejection of their supposedly "holy" books somehow rejects God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They can't accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they can't separate doctrine from divinity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were God himself because they think they're His word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the scriptures of any religion.
Everything that men have approved or rejected in their supposed "invariable word" of any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, edited, and often deliberately altered and distorted by mere erring men.

Chinese school shooter stabs nine people, three of them die
A man named Chen, according to the New China News Agency, broke into the elementary school building this morning and attacked at about 11:30 a.m. local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in the hospital.
Chen later committed suicide by jumping from a height, New China reported, citing the regional government.
In recent years, China has seen a series of similar attacks on schools and children.
The public is therefore calling for greater safety measures and better child protection in a country where many couples have one-child policies in line with the government's one-child policy.
Zeman showed the freshmen in Lane how he had to sit in school
The smallest pupils were taken to their classroom by the ninth graders, where they and the teacher waited for the president to arrive.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone in school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, but fortunately you won't have to, you are free people now", Zeman told the children.
His wife then gave the firstborn children a puzzle as a gift.

Apple has not commented on the issue.
Some celebrities have denied the photos were faked, but several have admitted the photos were real.
Among them is actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for playing the title role of Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, and actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in Deadly Trap 4.0.
The hacker's goal is to use the images and videos to enrich themselves.
The footage has reportedly been picked up by American magazines, according to a report on 4chan, but the hacker wants the community's money instead.
According to The Next Web, it's very likely that this is a vulnerability in iCloud's security.
Because a tool appeared on GitHub two days ago that allowed us to extract passwords from user accounts through brute force, which is automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
The tool was proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the tool was released.
iCloud users should therefore change their Apple ID password for security reasons.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is acceptable.
The leak of naked celebrity photos is a reminder of the safety of using online services.
Although the servers of companies like Apple, Google, or Microsoft are many times more secure than computers in homes or small businesses, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also wise to set the automatic backup of photos from your phone to only be done on Wi-Fi and after you have connected it to a charger.
This will allow you to move sensitive images to "safe" in time, and most importantly, you will have the space to delete unconditioned images, so they don't take up space in your online storage unnecessarily.

A clever way to save for college scripts.
With the cost of college scrip for many students exceeding $1,000 a year, an aspiring sophomore came up with a clever way to cut costs.
He devised a system of lending books to senior classmates with a nominal compensation to delay their return.
"I got a calculus book that normally costs $180 for ten dollars and a chicken nugget for the semester", says Schroeder, 19, a student at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required for his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the University Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and supplies, but students have different options for how to manage these expenses.
Online stores and creative solutions like Schroeder's are becoming the students' preferred choice.
The rise in textbook lending is allowing students to use a book for a semester, often at a significantly lower price than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookstores on campus, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey of the department shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were borrowed last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of textbooks are purchased at university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Bookstores.
Here are the 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The price of some new books on the Internet can be up to a third cheaper than in a university bookstore.
The suggested retail price for the ninth edition of Calculus by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but it can be purchased online at Chegg.com, a retailer specializing in textbooks, for $239.99.
Buy used
If you do not mind other people's comments or wear and tear, the textbooks are a good option.
Chegg.com has Calculus for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents for a used copy of Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business on Amazon.com.
The new one was selling for $48.
University professor Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their professors to see if older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes aren't essential to the work in seminaries.
If so, older editions may be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Borrowing
It is also worth considering borrowing textbooks, as long as you take good care of them, do not forget to return them, and do not need to have them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
A student could borrow Calculus for a whole semester for about twenty dollars.
Read the terms and conditions of the bookstore where you are borrowing the book, including penalties for annotations, embellishments or wear and tear.
Please note: If you do not return the book on time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books and other electronic publications
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a regular book.
Sometimes these books are essentially loaned out in the form of electronic licenses valid for a certain period of time from distributors like Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg is lending Calculus for six months at approximately $61.
According to Bracey, literary students can find the best deals, as many classics are now available for free download, while science and technical texts can be very expensive.
Anyway, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who's about to start Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN, because that guarantees you're buying the right book.
Before ordering a book online, Gault advises that you make sure it is actually in stock.
He's seen it in his own life.
The book he bought was sold out in four weeks, and he had to pay full price for a book from the university bookstore.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found a torso in the well of a rifle from the end of the war
The well is right next to St. George's.
We uncovered the surrounding vegetation and began to pull up the old mud - some five feet of mud and decayed leaves.
When we were approaching the clay bottom, we hit a head", described Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it, and found it was the torso of a German assault rifle used by SS troops.
The find is said to be unusual.
According to my information, rifles like this were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them", Novák added.
All the wooden structural stuff has decomposed over time, so it's useless.
Her body, however, is preserved - it holds its shape.
How did it get in the well?
There is one explanation.
Perhaps it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS, probably for fear of being deported.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were throwing guns in the forest", the finders think.
The rifle was the only thing the Autumn Spirit Movement enthusiasts found in the well.
"There could be hand grenades, there used to be a lot of them all around, so we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully searched the mud to prevent any accidents, but there was nothing else down there", Novák said.
The find will end up in a museum depository at a castle in the nearby Silesian Rudoltics.
Ukrainian general: I have not yet released the captured Chech
An exclusive interview with Lieutenant General Volodymyr Ruban, who is liberating Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Excuse me, I have to take this... they're calling me from Donetsk", apologized about eight times in an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz, Ukrainian General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, who is also the director of the Center for the Liberation of Prisoners of War there.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in the television debate.
With each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers or the places where they are - or should be - which Ruban specifies with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
"That's it - go there", he finished one of his flash discussions with Donetsk and turned to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, former fighter pilot and active participant in the anti-government protests on Maidan.
Yesterday - when we were arranging the interview - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists is being carried out 24 hours a day.
You may be aware that Czechs are fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number at up to 30.
There could be many more.
Have you met any Czech prisoners during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have already liberated captured Serbs, Dagestanians, Chechens, a Swede, a Georgian... but not yet the Czech.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we should find your captured compatriot and be able to free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and are captured by Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in the Ukrainian volunteer battalions and the separatists capture them, they will be shot without mercy after interrogation, just like any other foreigner.
The Separatists consider these men mercenaries and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and, therefore, maybe Chechnya among them - they put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
The guy's going to live.
The Ukrainian side behaves like a state even in war.
And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to rescue?
If I understand this correctly, an exchange.
Some sources say it's already exceeded a hundred men.
We stopped counting how many people we helped a long time ago.
We've only liberated them... not saved them from war if they choose to continue fighting.
The Saviors are doctors, surgeons, but we're not.
That's right.
And every day, more and more are added.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be about the exchange.
Sometimes a mere human request is all it takes to free a prisoner.
A.cz: It is rumoured that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust among pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect on both sides of the war?
That's a tough one.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "mad general with steel balls".
I'm not offended.
And maybe that's the essence of what we do.
As head of the Ukrainian Corps of Cadets, I've acquired some authority before.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I act with integrity and speak the truth.
Even when it's very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government or the Donetsk or the Luhan government.
If they torture and kill people?
I simply tell them that they torture and kill them.
And that they're crimes.
I've risked my life many times, even being captured in a prisoner exchange... this job could be the end of me at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and tortures of prisoners do you know about?
... (long pause)... Ukrainians and separatists are using torture on prisoners during interrogations.
I'm sorry to hear that.
And the executions?
They only take place on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army executes prisoners.
No indication that the Ukrainian military is doing anything similar.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I cannot and do not want to give the numbers.
Describe the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are seeking independence and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Lugansk - or so they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists are fed up with the oligarchs and are their bitter opponents - to the death.
As we say, they ate them to the throat.
The same dreams and desires were expressed by people at the Maidan, by the way.
And now I'm speculating: Russia is supporting the separatists and the West is supporting the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be big and the other to be small.
But there is an irreconcilable contradiction in my own statement.
A.cz: How do you feel about one of the most hardcore leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Whenever I cross the lines of the front lines, I am unarmed, showing the soldiers or the armed men my bare hands.
And I'm always on both sides of the 200 or 300 meter gun or in the optical sight.
I can see the faces of the people who are pointing at me all the time... and they can pull the trigger on their guns any time.
He's a paratrooper, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, then only as a small province in the great Russian Empire.
Anyway, he talks about it all the time and he thinks the Ukraine is some kind of misunderstanding.
He said that such a state shouldn't even exist.
He is also the irreconcilable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in a Ukrainian TV talk show you called your Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk a weak, helpless and tired "leader" who would do best to leave quickly.
I always get scared at least five times for the 300 meters.
So why should I hide behind the idea that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is hurting our country?
A.cz: Do you think he's involved in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians call Yatsenyuk "the king".
And the rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of the Ukrainians to be feared or to be respected and authoritative by others.
His behavior is a direct copy of the rabbit's.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister he has no right to cry in parliament, to beg, to play tricks with, to threaten to resign... he has to run the country, to manage it and in wartime to protect it.
When the country is threatened, the Prime Minister has no right to family, friends, a rest for his weeping emotions.
He's the first minister of Ukraine.
What about the Jace?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak because he was never strong... he doesn't fight for Ukraine, he just complains about everything.
He should go.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the sales
The Sylvester Stallone trilogy returned less than $30 million from a $90 million budget in the U.S., and Sin City: A Woman I Would Kill For returned only $12 million from a $70 million budget.
The Cameron Diaz movie Sex Tape made only $14.6 million in its opening weekend, and the kids' movies like How to Train Your Dragon 2 were a disappointment for theaters.
According to a Telegraph article by film critic Robbie Collins, when it comes to children's films, the quality of the films themselves is to blame.
Collin called 2014 "the worst year" for children's films, and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 "a functional sequel".
When it comes to movies targeted at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem may not necessarily be the quality of the movies themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average ratings of movie premieres aired in at least 2,000 theaters between Memorial Day and July 20th in 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinions of both audiences and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is of similar quality to last year's hits.
Some commentators have suggested that the change in viewership and the increased popularity of Internet servers like Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's adaptation of The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times are changing".
We have to accept that and not try to chase what's gone.
In contrast to the current Hollywood box office crisis, Netflix's online revenue reached $1.2 billion, almost double the $837 million it made last year.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book rights, and predicted the "collapse" of Hollywood.
In light of the current decline, some commentators claim that there may be something to his catastrophic prediction.
With the release of potential big box office hits in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, The Minotaur and Jurassic World, other numbers in the movie industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the decline in sales simply "cyclical". He told The Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the biggest box office summer in history, and no one will care about sales".
North Korea threatens Seoul again, launches another short-range missile
North Korea has fired another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul has announced.
The alleged missile test came shortly after the conclusion of a joint military exercise between the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparing for an invasion.
Chang'an Province lies in the north-west of the DPRK, on the border with China.
DPA quoted a South Korean Ministry of Defence spokesman as saying that the missiles were launched from a location in the northwest of the DPRK and reached a range of approximately 200 kilometres.
North Korea appears to have fired its first missile from Chang'an Province, South Korean media reported, citing military sources.
I heard there's an underground launch pad for Scud missiles in the province.
It's another in a series of similar tests carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO summit: first protests in Newport and Cardiff
There was a protest this weekend against the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for what was described as a counter-summit meeting.
Stephen Fairclough was monitoring the situation over the weekend, speaking to protesters who had travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage tourists were airlifted to safety after spending a night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike to Govetts Leap in Blackheath on Sunday afternoon.
When they did not return home, concerned relatives called the police about eight o'clock that evening.
A search party was sent out, including local police and a rescue team, and the couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls at around 11:00 p.m.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with them overnight and were picked up Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition.
The bad guy came back from Opava with a point, and the winner was your little brother.
The 23-year-old forward had the chance to make the decision, but he missed two of his biggest chances.
The goal was called by a close-range shot three minutes before the end, but instead of the net, it ended up on the goalkeeper of Opava Josef Květoň.
I had it on my feet, I have to take chances.
I'm mad at myself", your little one poured ash on his head.
"I should have put it higher under the lid, it was a little bit too light", he mused.
The defense of Sigma did not allow Opava much, except for Mikul's drive from the 11th minute, which was covered by the goalkeeper Reichl.
Then the Hanas started to push, but they were not allowed to defend in the block, and Květony caught the shots from a distance.
We had 15 minutes to settle, then we took the initiative.
We were better in the second half, we had more of the game and Opava was only threatening us from standard situations.
But the chance was not changed by Vašiček, and it ended 0: 0", lamented Hanák coach Leoš Kalvad.
The point was also taken due to absences in the line-up, where in addition to the two injured, Petr Vavřík and three-goal scorer Peter Ševčík, who are visiting Silesian from Sigma, were missing.
Unlike its previous policy, it did not allow them to enter.
The alternates deserve to be discharged.
Sigma was more football-friendly, but we didn't let it go to anything except for one standard", Slezan coach Petr Baránek said.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and fighting to be seen.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent gain for us", he added.
Sigma has now drawn four points, which puts them in 13th place.
Nothing that would satisfy club boss Josef Lebr, who after losing to Znojm conditioned his million dollar deposit to the cashier on diametrically opposite performances in the next few matches.
"We took into account Mr. Lebra's warning, so there is no question that the boys would not want to fight", Kalvoda noted, adding to the sleeping shooter Vašíček: "I believe that it will come and when he scores a goal, it will start to fall there.
But after the first hit, I'll replace him so he can save the goals for the next matches", Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has twice eclipsed Venice.
The film festival is in crisis
After the huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iñárritu was suddenly ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next days suggested that the interest in the 71st edition of the Venice Film Festival had somewhat decreased.
Whether it was because the seating capacity of the largest theater had increased to fourteen hundred or because Birdman was followed by critically acclaimed but less appealing films such as the documentary about the Indonesian genocide in the 1960s, the Look of Silence and other films with social themes from American's 99 Homes to Iranian's Stories, the cinema simply remained empty.
Comic book heroes
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace was not as crowded as in the past and it was reportedly no longer a problem to find a last-minute hotel room.
The crisis is the most talked about subject in Italy, and it's no wonder that it has hit institutions as respected as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not one of lack of personalities, but of those present exclusively in connection with the films.
While younger fans were eager to sign autographs for comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had successfully portrayed dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations without exception, the highlight was the visit of legendary actor Al Pacino.
He's also starred in two movies.
In the off-the-cuff story "Apocalypse", directed by Oscar-winning Barry Levison and based on the novel by Philip Roth, the 74-year-old Pacino plays a role that is close to his heart: an actor at the height of his fame, suffering from depression at the end of his career and in his personal life.
But seeing him the very next day as the odd, small-town hardware store owner in David Gordon Green's Manglehorn was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Actor should not be missed - but does an artist of Pacino's format still need awards?
Perhaps his greatest satisfaction is the love of the public, especially the Italian, for though born in New York, Al Pacino proudly proclaims the country of his grandparents.
Points for Italy
By the way, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film since Birdman to be rewarded with a standing ovation.
The Calabrian branch of the mafia is seen in this film as a family relationship between clans that fight each other for power and money, and the director was able to harmonize all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality script, camera, music and actors.
He also starred in the chamber psychological thriller Hungry Heart, which was directed by Saverio Costanzo and starred Alba Rohrwacher as a woman whose anxiety nearly kills her own child.
In contrast, neither Ransom for Glory nor 3 Hearts were warmly received by French competition films, both of which follow the traditional model of consumer films, which rely on the popularity of the actors.
But after all, two really great films, Birdman and Black Souls, are not that much for the first half of the festival.
And while the festival films have a depressing theme, Peter Bogdanovich's new film She's Funny That Way, a comedy-drama shown in Venice out of competition and filmed in the style of 1940s American comedies, has been able to lift the mood for more than a day.
Police caught four pervitin manufacturers in Prague, transporting drugs from Poland
"Detectives have in recent days arrested three men aged 42, 42 and 37 and a 25-year-old woman who were involved in the production and sale of the drug Pervitin on Prague 9 from November last year to August this year", said police spokeswoman Jana Rössler.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the task force in Cihlářská Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who was part of the group as a buyer of medicines in Poland and a seller of doses.
The next day, detectives apprehended another member of the group, a 37-year-old man, with the prior consent of the district attorney.
The last of the four was caught by police in the early hours of Wednesday 20 August at the Malaysian incineration plant", the spokeswoman said.
For the transport of drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drugs
The main organizer had a wide field of influence.
In the workshop of the summer campus, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Koněvova Street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced pervitin, provided various tools and chemicals needed for its production and ensured the transport of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He weighed the drug, broke it into plastic bags, and sold the pervitin.
He was helped by a 25-year-old woman who had never been convicted of transporting drugs from Poland or selling them to drug addicts.
For this, she received a reward from the organiser in the form of a third of the drug produced", Rössler added.
The forensic team also conducted several searches of homes, following a court order, and seized drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, salary bags, syringes, tubes, and other tools and items that, according to the expertise, could be considered as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
The dealer has been convicted seven times since 1995
"From the available records, the police found that the main organizer had been convicted of property crimes seven times since 1995, but the woman was not convicted", the police spokesperson added.
The last detainee was sentenced to probation in 2006 for the crime of sexual abuse, and the 37-year-old auto mechanic, who is on parole, has been sentenced to nine sentences since 2009.
He was also a major property crime.
The investigator charged three men and a woman with the crime of illicit manufacture and other handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to ten years in prison.
The investigator eventually submitted a motion for a detention order to the prosecutor for three people, and the judge eventually placed them there", the spokeswoman said.
The fourth defendant, a 37-year-old repeat offender, has been released.
His position and role in this case was not as crucial as the others.
The police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers wood and carbon chess.
Ferrari offers very interesting things in its other products at very "interesting" prices.
A good example is handmade chessboards in Italy with a 42 x 42 cm board.
If you like it, you can have over $40,000.
The exact price is $43,405.
The customer receives a set of wooden figures painted in black and red and placed in a wooden box covered with carbon fibre.
Perhaps no one is surprised to learn that instead of the classic rider, players have a figure of a climbing horse.
If chess does not seem to be a valuable gift, there is also a handmade Ferrari 500 F2 in 1:1:8 scale.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
Cancellation of high schools and colleges is pointless.
The Czech Republic has few people with general education and statistics show that gymnasts have good jobs.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There's been a lot of preparation in the schools over the last fortnight.
Mostly, it's routine stuff, like bringing flower pots from the summer storage back to the classroom and sniffing out chalk.
They'll have a little more excitement in the burning gym.
A few days before the season begins, they search the library for furniture, computers, and other technical equipment, as well as literature.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year gymnasium in Hórce after three years opens and resumes its activity.
Not on a public platform, but on a private one.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the founders being so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the school's existence would be confirmed by entering it in the school register maintained by the MŠMT.
French socialists should shut up and put France in order says key ally of Francois Hollande
Valls calls on the deeply fragmented left to show their support for a militant socialist president whose redistribution of power has not met with the approval of the majority of the French people.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stand by him", he said, and he applauded.
As a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question France's controversial 35-hour workweek, despite passionate speculation from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who earlier in the week had suggested that the rules be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain "cohesive" with the government.
But Christiane Taubir, the Minister of Justice, crossed the budget line when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious socialist deputies, where she criticized the Socialist Party for making "the French lose faith in the future".
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far right, laughed at the constant internal strife between the socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls is naked, forced to form a new government after the previous one didn't last the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of the autumn or winter", Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party's call to dissolve Parliament and said she believed the party could win the snap election and that she was ready to run the country.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and in May the extreme right-wing conservatives won the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's term in office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French will soon run out of patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It's a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that the situation is changing", he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art no longer limit Prague's choices
The amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new leadership of the capital.
No more gambling will disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
There will be no restrictions on the walking of dogs.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees in the House of Representatives until the October elections.
"In addition, the decision on changes should not be taken by the current city management, whose mandate ends in a few weeks", said councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Several municipalities have decided to abolish gambling in their territories in recent weeks, for example Prague 5 and 7.
But the hernia won't go away, the gambling ordinance won't change yet.
It's the job of the new city manager after the election.
We would not have been able to do it technically now, for example, because of the deadlines for submitting comments and so on,' explained Manhart.
He added that the last meeting of the current council, which must approve the change in the decree, will take place on September 11.
A referendum on a general ban on gambling is planned on the day of the municipal elections in the Prague 1 and Prague 8 districts.
Currently, gambling is prohibited in Prague 2 and Prague 12.
The same rules will not apply to street art, or busking, for the same reasons.
The city of Prague 1 has already sent the city administration a proposal to extend the current list of prohibited places.
The Prague 5 doesn't want musicians around the Angel either.
The city's been working on a dog-walking ordinance for months, but it's not quite finished.
Both the location of the heron and the issue of busking are regulated by city ordinances.
Only the Municipal Council can issue or amend them.
The councils have only an advisory vote, they cannot issue ordinances themselves.
Last week he placed victory within reach of the Scottish independence movement.
The Scottish independence campaign was in danger of making that mistake for the third time, when it nearly put up billboards all over Scotland asking whether Scotland wanted to be rich.
But you won't win the hearts of the Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, nor will you win their respect by threatening them.
The New Testament morality is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still attend church today.
The Scots are far more likely to kick the money changers out of the temple than to let them dictate how they vote.
Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond knows this well, and that is why he repeatedly asked his rival, the Unionist Darling, in a televised debate, whether he was willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if the Scottish voters voted for independence and to support a single currency for Scotland and England.
It forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into this trap with a grimace.
Of course, Darling will not support the Scottish electorate's mandate.
However, the debate about what kind of currency Scotland would have has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates the Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and the defense of the public health service that is free to the public.
Darling has backed the London bankers on the currency issue and has also given the impression that he will not protest the privatisation of the health service.
By, as Salmond put it, "getting in bed with the conservatives".
It's a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with the Tories.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke to the Confederation of British Industry, not the electorate, in Scotland.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with the Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee housewife.
The Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron at least managed to say that Scotland can be "a successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain.
The message is clear: Scouts must not be bounced around and must accept what is.
The longest year has 10 months.
The pessimistic beginning of school by Milos Urban

Milos Urban The longest year
The end of the holidays was the best part of the whole holiday, the last week of not going anywhere and just lounging and hanging out with the girl in the summer, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes, when they could be got from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
Reading Fast Arrows for the 50th time, riding a bicycle around the Imperial and back across the Vary, somewhere near the tennis courts, no longer hot, the sun caressing my back and shoulders, beating the rays of farewell.
A little nervous in the evening, still on holiday, sleeping until 11:30 a.m., worse in a week, going from a few minutes to two hours before bedtime, waking up at 7:30 a.m.
He'll be here on Monday.
Mostly it doesn't rain, but in the summertime, he's sneaking around the school.
To creep into the ghostly light on the tiles and feel like a plastic figure in a glass case, there's that school, the A.T.C.
West with a monstrous pink plaster, and in front of it, old familiar faces and a few new ones, boys more outspoken, girls more tittied.
There are the bad guys, the ones to avoid, but it's interesting how they're so unmistakably together and how fast they're getting here.
And these grown-up-looking girls who came in with a big mouth are laughing hysterically about something, like their lives have changed over the holidays, whereas everything's back to normal with me.
And the freshmen, some nervous and others excited, why do they come here at all?
Because they have to, military education.
So, inside, the cold moisture of the floor and the faint smell of disinfectant, the poisoned schoolmaster with a mop, unfortunately still the same one who says he will lend the pupil the keys to the tin cupboard where the textbooks can be left, and there are still so few of them.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dressing room is still there, it's not working now, it's nice and airy, but in a week it'll be worse.
The thought of it makes my stomach turn and my head hurt.
A head that will be even more unable to grasp the lessons of mathematics, the devil's game for the chosen few, among whom I am not and never will be.
Again, the threes and fours, the forbidden fives, hiding from the test, fitting into the bench and sublimating, the best, being there and not being there, existing as a name in the classroom and dreaming up stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas in space where no one is competing with anyone, humiliating anyone and no one is getting their feet wet.
The longest year has ten months.
And it's only day one, like it was years ago.
She let her daughters die when they were born.
She 's facing a very special punishment .
The first birth occurred in March 2012 in a public toilet booth at the bus station in Jihlava.
She had a baby girl, which she had wrapped in a blanket, hidden under her coat, and carried to a roadside shelter, where she dropped it in a bush a few dozen yards from the road.
She gave birth on her way to school.
I guess I got it a little early.
I was on my way to school.
I had to go to the bathroom on the bus, and I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with scissors that I wore to school", the accused said, adding that she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The next day, she returned to the scene, put the body of the child in a backpack and drove away, took the body out of the backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the stairs of her grandmother's house in Havlíčková Brodě", the lawsuit states, noting that it is not entirely clear when the death of the newborn occurred.
It could be tens of minutes or hours after birth, strangulation by covering with a blanket or by being put under a jacket, chilling, or bleeding from an untied umbilical cord.
A similar scenario repeated itself the following spring.
The woman, at an unspecified time between February and April 12, when the body of the child was found by accidental witnesses under the bushes by the pond at Havlíčkobrodská, secretly gave birth again.
This time in the bathroom of the penthouse in the family home.
Without checking for live birth, without cutting and tying the umbilical cord wrapped around the neck, she placed the baby in several plastic bags, including a plastic bag, and left him in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his then-partner were taken to the pond.
Finally, a friend gave her up.
The father of the two children was the defendant's boyfriend, who allegedly did not know about the partner's pregnancies.
For that reason, he is not now on trial, but only punished for a violation of the Funeral Law.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not being punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the baby against my will.
I know my decision was wrong, but it seemed human at the time", did not hide the indignation of the defendant, who allegedly in a relationship with a man succumbed to fear of him.
During her deposition, the young woman spoke in a rather calm manner.
The only moment that brought tears to her eyes was when she spoke of her relationship with her parents, whom she had left when she came of age.
She said she didn 't want to kill
"They come to visit me every two weeks, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it", she exclaimed.
I didn't get a kit because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I always wanted to put him in a baby box, but I don't know what happened to me that I didn't.
I can't explain it to you", she told the judge.
But she denied that she had acted with intent and purpose to kill the newborn.
The second child, she claimed, was stillborn.
But she didn't stop drinking during her pregnancy.
I've narrowed it down.
And he didn't drink hard.
I also cut down on smoking", she said.
Although she was pregnant on both occasions, she insisted on the fact that she had a medical condition, that she was dehydrated.
And a friend of mine.
The main hearing will continue in the castle court on Tuesday with the testimony of the forensic experts.
A verdict could be reached by Wednesday.
The woman faces up to 18 years in prison, or a suspended sentence.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion acquisition of Prestige Cruise.
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the third largest cruise operator in the world, has advanced negotiations to buy Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The acquisition of Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company that competes with larger competitors Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), has provided access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships and wealthy clientele.
The deal could be announced as early as this week, a source told the Sunday Times, but cautioned that the talks may not be wrapped up successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources declined to be named because the proceedings are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, and a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment on the situation.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates thirteen cruise ships on voyages in North America, the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's 2013 revenue was $2.57 billion, up 13% from 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company reported revenues of USD 1,2 billion in 2013, up 6% from the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise segment is expected to benefit in the coming year from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
The companies compete to become the preferred choice for these customers when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered an initial public offering with US regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has held a majority stake in the company since 2007 in a deal worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000 when it merged with the cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure and casino businesses controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise Company listed its shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the regulatory filing at the end of June, Genting owned a 28% equity stake, Apollo 20% and private equity firm TPG Capital LP 8%.
According to the registration documentation, the first public offerings cover together 82% of the North American passenger volume for Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong the day after the vote decision provoke Chinese authorities
Nearby, a group of Beijing loyalists waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved only two of the three candidates to run in the 2017 Hong Kong elections.
All candidates must first gain the support of the nominating committee, which will likely consist of members loyal to Beijing.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballot and get pro-democracy activists to renew their pledge and cripple the financial center of Hong Kong's Occupy Central protests.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tension, with Chinese leaders worried that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing released a detailed report in June shadowing China's official authority in Hong Kong, pro-democracy activists staged an unofficial referendum on the special administrative region and hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's commercial district and occupied it.
The press conference, which will be attended by Premier Li, is being organized by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Council Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Bureau Feng Wei were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists have declared that they will gather outside the Hong Kong Government offices this afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start negotiations with eastern Ukraine on state sovereignty
According to a Russian newspaper account of the events, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government on Sunday to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the state sovereignty of the breakaway areas.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin's comment was not meant to imply that the separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed so that the Russian-speaking area would be empowered to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call on the Kiev government to treat the pro-Russian rebels as equals echoes the apparent strategy he has followed since the outbreak of the unrest five months ago: Help the separatists seize territory and get the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorussian de facto independence so that it can join Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with state TV's First Channel, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to retake eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which separatists took in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have referred to the newly occupied territory as Novorossiya or New Russia, a term that refers to the glorious pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russian news agency Itar-Tass quoted Putin as saying that anyone who believes that peace talks are on the horizon is delusional, as Ukrainian politicians launched campaigns ahead of parliamentary elections on October 26, while government troops are attacking civilians in separatist-held areas.
In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations not only on legal issues, but also on the political organization of society and the status of the state sovereignty of southeastern Ukraine, he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of a broader autonomy that has been discussed with the Kiev leadership for months, and which is intended to allay the concerns of Russian-speaking areas about the threat to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov stated that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter for negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.
The Kremlin spokesman's intervention, which was meant to correct a "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks, underscored the Russian leadership's approach to dealing with the separatist insurgency in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two million-strong population are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulty annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russian, and public opinion polls conducted before the conflict showed broad support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have negotiated in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to the main Russian naval fleet, a naval trading facility and historic coastal resorts.
The area between Rostov-on-Don and Crimea in Russia is also a centre of mines, factories and smelters producing important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his June 7 inauguration speech that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections - consider constitutional changes that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy is very different from the vision of the Kremlin and the separatists, who accuse Moscow of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to treat the separatists as equals followed another rebel advance last week after Russian troops and tanks penetrated into eastern Ukraine from a previously quiet area along the Sea of Azov.
Separatists backed by Russia have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that Ukrainian security officials fear this is a campaign to take over strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This hastened a massive civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port of 500,000 people with its metallurgical combines, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke Saturday at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels, calling for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching a point of no return", Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive action - leaders are calling for the adoption of further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops broke into the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists.
The first of 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaisk during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved in the leaked photos scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust at the hackers who allegedly stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after the biggest celebrity hacking scandal ever, a series of explicit photos of Jennifer Lawrence leaked online.
Hacker claims to have 60 nude photos of star Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The iCloud leak allegedly released the personal photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greece to marry him last month, told Confidential magazine: "It's disgusting".
All private correspondence and all private pictures should remain private.
It's a shame that personal information can be stolen and released to the public.
Grecko, who is now in New York, reportedly told online newspapers that the hack was "unprecedented" and those who were targeted "were humiliated".
The hacker is believed to have obtained 30 photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of her toplessly rocking around the pool.
Palmer appeared in the film Love and Honor, where she was opposed by Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of the television series Chuck Strahovski and actress of the thriller Sucker Punch Browning yesterday stolen footage without comment.
TMZ quoted Lawrence's rep as saying, "This is a clear violation of privacy".
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on his Twitter: "Posting photos of hacked phones is the same as selling stolen goods".
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The Sigma Footballers have won the LeBron without winning.
The thunder and lightning that Sigma's co-owner Josef Leber struck his subordinates last week seems to be a thing of the past.
Let the Opavas bring home a point for a scoreless draw.
The club boss's bravery and combativeness have made him a bit of a target.
The payroll money could be coming to the club soon.
"I'm going to have one more match, as I said last week, but I'm already more optimistic", said Lebr, who confirmed that despite Sigma not winning, the players had convinced him with their improved performance.
The fighting and the commitment that we played with, especially in the second half, was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In a case like this, I can forgive you for not winning.
If we had played like this from the beginning of the season, I'm sure we wouldn't have lost yet", thinks the Rabbit.
At Opava, Sigma withstood the initial pressure from the home team, then evened the game, and in the second half, they were better.
After the victory, Calvo's team tried to score, but they didn't reach their goal, so they couldn't win.
The result is not what we expected.
We were just one more chance to be satisfied", said LeBron, who doesn't think the change in attitude of the players was caused by his threats.
There were definitely more aspects.
Whether it's from me, from the coach, or from the fans", said LeB.
The pressure is something Sigma has to deal with.
The players were reluctant to comment after the match in Opava last week.
I'm trying to get rid of all of these things.
I tried not to admit it", shook his head the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl.
Then, without comment, he left the question on Lebrova's statement from last week, the striker Václav Vašíček, who did not turn the biggest opportunity of Sigma in the Saturday match.
But afterwards, he said little about the pressure.
We're gonna be under a lot of pressure.
Everybody wants to get their hands on us.
"We showed today that if we fight and fuck everyone, we can do it", he said.
They Heeded the Warning
Coach Leoš Kalvoda also admitted that preparing for the match was not easy, given the atmosphere in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys have taken notice, and today it was clear that they took Mr. Leber's warning to heart.
Even before that, it wasn't about not wanting to fight and getting away with it", said the coach.
It was like the first 15 minutes today.
It took us a while to get used to the toughness and realize what the second division was all about.
It's not just about football, it's about the fighting", Kalvoda said.
We can only hope that in the next few games, Sigma will be back to square one.
"I'd like to believe that very much", he added.
