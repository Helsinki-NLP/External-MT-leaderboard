Welsh AMs are concerned about the image of the Muppets
There is a resistance among some members of the Assembly to the suggestion that his title should be changed to MWP (MP for Wales).
The reason for this is that the Assembly is planned to be renamed the Welsh Parliament.
All AMs involved in politics are worried that they will be ridiculed.
A Labour AM said his group was concerned about its not being linked to Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means dirty.
A Pled AM said the whole group was "not happy" and suggested other options.
A Welsh political party said its group was "independent" on the name change, but noted that a small verbal change in the words could have defeated the MWP.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced exactly as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the legislation on the name change, said: "The final decision of any commentator on what is called for by the members of the Assembly will certainly be a matter for the members themselves".
Under the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission reported on the results of a public consultation on proposals that had received significantly more support for the Assembly to be renamed the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of AM, the Commission supported the Welsh MPs or WMP, but the most support in public opinion was given to the MWP option.
Obviously, AM is suggesting many other options, but it is having a hard time getting consensus for presiding officer Elin Jones, who hopes to present a legal draft for the change within weeks.
The legislative work being prepared for the changes will also include other changes in the ways of working in the Assembly, including the rules for disqualification of AM and the drafting of the committee system.
When debating legislation, AM will get the last vote on what to call them.
Macedonians are going to hold a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was called to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, one of whose provinces is also named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is indicative of its province and has repeatedly objected to its bids for membership in the EU and NATO.
A rival to the referendum on the name change, the Macedonian president, says he will ignore the vote.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Ze'ev, as well as supporters of the referendum, have argued that the name change is only a means of joining the EU and NATO.
The fewer churches in Harlem, the fewer bells ringing at St. Martin's.
"The elders I spoke to for historical matters", said Mr. Adams, "say that before there used to be bars and churches on every corner".
"Today, it's all coming to an end".
He said that the lower bar is understandable.
He said, "People are building societies in a different way today.
"Bars are no longer like the living room of the neighborhood where people go every day".
For churches, they worry that the money spent on selling property won't last as long as the leaders hope, "and that soon the money will run out or later the leaders will be right back where they started".
He added that churches may have been converted into proprietary apartment buildings with a variety of occupants, which would not help to protect the remaining places of worship nearby.
"The number of people buying houses in these buildings as property rights will continue to increase and thus there will come a time when these churches will be closed down completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who are coming in as property rights will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white people from the religious community before Harlem became the Black Metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade after St. Martin's.
The original white members of the Methodist religious community left in the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by the black people of the religious community who worshipped in the nearby places of worship.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black religious society under the pastor John Howard Johnson who led the removal of retailers on 125th Street, a major place for shopping in Harlem, where black people were opposed to hiring or promoting.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but after Father Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, the bells were started.
Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin, Father David Johnson, proudly called the bell "the door of fortune for the poor".
The expert who played the bell in July described it as something like this: "A cultural heritage" and "a priceless historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who played a huge bell 18 years ago at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said that no one else was appointed to replace him at St. Martin.
What happened at St. Martin's over the past few months became a complex story of artisans and contractors, some of whom were appointed by the general leaders of the church and the rest by the religious-related provinces.
The vestry (where the worship materials are kept) became the domain of the parish (the clergy of the area) made up of ordinary leaders - in July the province expressed concern that the province would "demand to meet the costs" for the vestry, even if the vestry was not involved in hiring the craftsmen and contractors employed in the province.
Some clergy in the area complained about the lack of clarity on the part of the province.
A 13-year-old teenager was injured by a shark attack while diving to catch a crab.
A 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while diving in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials say.
The attack took place near Beacon Beach in Ancinitas just before 7am.
Chad Hummel of KSWB-TV in San Diego said he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help and then he and a group of people reached out to get him out of the water.
Hummel said that at first he thought the boy was making a noise in the excitement of catching a crab, but then he realized he was screaming, 'Something is biting me!'
Something is biting me!'
Hummel said that when he looked at the boy, he found that the boy 's entire skull had been torn.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: there is a shark in the water!"
The teenager was admitted to Ready Children's Hospital in San Diego where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of the attacking shark has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a media conference that a shark was detected in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Gilles further said that the victim has a severe injury to the upper torso.
For investigation and security purposes, authorities have blocked beach access from Ponto Beach in Cassavalad to Swamis Beach in Asinitas for 48 hours.
Giles said that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to include department store style Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by hiring expert assistants with beauty products.
It is going to enter the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market with good volume despite continued decline in fashion goods and home goods sales, these bulk quantities of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if the scheme is successful, turnover will be increased to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty is being made in supermarkets, which aim to find their place in the market after bringing in TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said that this will double its offering to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing products of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more opportunities with branded products found in shops like Boots.
Supermarkets are also re-launching their boutique makeup products, so that most products are vegan-friendly - this will increase demand somewhat rapidly among small and large retailers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will also be testing the special feature at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second is due to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
In the shift to less food being sold daily in online shopping and local convenience stores, more and more efforts are being made to increase visits.
Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coope said outlets like department stores will be more crowded as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount providers Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has hundreds of Argos outlets and has opened several stores since bringing the two chains together two years ago, which shows that grocery sales have been boosted and the deal made more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to re-market beauty and pharmacy products had failed.
Sainsbury's had done business with Boots in the early 2000s, but the way the revenue from the drug stores in its supermarket was divided had to end the joint business.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold 281 stores of the pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for £125 million, after which a new strategy emerged.
It said Lloyds will play a key role in the scheme by adding La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores as well as several top luxury skincare brands.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and colour of our beauty products to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also brought in specially trained colleagues who will help us in advising.
We have tailored our brand scope to the needs of each individual and the attractive environment and in convenient locations, which means we have reached an attractive destination for beauty products that challenge the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones has expressed his displeasure at Holly Willoughby 's departure from the £11 million deal.
When TV presenter Holly Billubi decided to part ways with Dragons Den star Peter Jones' £11 million deal for the lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, Peter Jones was outraged.
Billubi doesn't have time for his homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of these two was being compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old morning presenter announced her separation on Instagram.
Holly Billubi withdrew herself from her lucrative lifestyle brand business with Dragons Den star Peter Jones at the last minute - so she could focus on her new best-of-breed contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources revealed that when TV's Golden Girl admitted during a tense meeting at Jones' business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that she was parting ways with her new deal - worth £1.5m - Jones expressed outrage at the fact, meaning Billubi no longer has enough time to give her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was being considered to double the estimated £11 million offered by Willoughby.
Willuby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was separating from Truly, after which Jones left the UK to move to a holiday home.
A source said: "Truly was once at the top of Holi 's priorities.
This was seen as its long - term future, which would see the brand move forward in the next few decades.
His decision shocked everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to starting.
The warehouse at Marlowe Headquarters is full of goods to be sold".
Experts believe the departure of Britain's richest morning presenter could cost the firm millions as it has invested heavily in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and is likely to delay its launch.
It can also end a long friendship.
Billubi's three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Cappe for the past ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The holiday couple and Jones own 40 percent of Baldwin 's TV production company.
Billubi has now become a brand ambassador for M&S and will be replaced by Ant McPartlin to host ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
"We would not like to discuss his business dealings", a source close to Jones told the paper last night.
'Serious Talks' and Then We Agreed
He mocked the criticism, saying that the news media would continue to comment on him, some would consider it "different from the presidency" and would be too positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump made so many sacrifices?
Trump said in his showy "News Anchor" Voice.
"I have not sacrificed anything".
He said Kim's interest in a second meeting follows his first meeting in Singapore in June, the first meeting in which Trump took a major step toward denuclearising North Korea.
But, the nuclear free talks were stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North was not waiting for a "consistent response" from the U.S. to North Korea's initial disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the US has continued to press for sanctions to be maintained.
Trump's rally speech was marked by a very optimistic outlook.
"We are engaged in building good relations with North Korea", he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
which would have killed millions of people.
Now our relationship is very good.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - including completing rocket tests, helping free hostages and returning the remaining American troops home.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach to negotiating relations with Kim.
Pointing directly at the crowd in front of him, Trump said, "It's very easy to stay in office, but we have about 200 people to stop 10,000 people from outside the country trying to get in the area".
A tsunami and earthquake devastated an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed for the event.
Despite the devastation of more than 10 percent of Lombok's population, no national disaster was declared, and international aid was a condition.
"In many situations, unfortunately, it was clear to them that they were not seeking international help, so it became a bit more challenging", Ms. Sumbu said.
Nevertheless, Save the Children visited Palu with a team, but it is not yet certain whether staff from other countries can come here to help.
National Disaster Agency spokesman Mr. Sutopo said Indonesian officials were taking stock of the situation in Palu, looking at whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
In view of the repeated incidents in Indonesia, it seems that the country is not prepared for natural disasters at all.
Although shelters have been built for tsunami victims in Haichi, they are not like shelters found on other beaches.
The tsunami warning siren has been reduced in Palo, however damaging the warning may be, it is likely to increase the loss of life.
Even if the best time to visit is the best time, getting to the middle of Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
The management of personnel and goods in natural disasters is always complex.
The earthquake victims are being brought to a hospital in Lombok for treatment, which is a long way from Palu and takes at least three days to reach from the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's very poor infrastructure an issue for his election campaign and spent a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's administration has been dispersed by a lack of funds as re-election is due next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority members have made religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people died and over 10,000 were left homeless as Christian and Muslim gangs fought each other in the streets using knives, bows and arrows and other dangerous weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge mysteriously leans over and equalises with Chelsea
On Saturday, Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London to save Liverpool from relegation from the Premier League.
From about 30 yards away, Sturridge was passed by Zidane Shakiri, at the time his team was 1-0 down on a Chelsea goal.
He hit the ball with his left foot before making a shot from the far post.
His effort went to the top right corner of the net with height above the box.
The ball finally fell out of Kepa Arizabloga 's grasp and went into the net.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com: "It was just an attempt to get in that position, to get in touch with the ball and get it as far away from players like Shaq as possible, so I just tried to take as much time as possible for myself".
"I saw the spines coming and touched them once and didn't think too much about it and just shot".
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at halftime after a goal by Belgium 's top player Aidan Hazard in the 25th minute.
Before the ball reached the midfield and reached the Liverpool half game, the Blues striker passed Matteo Kovasic in that game.
Kovasić delivered the ball very quickly into the midfield.
Then, he shot the ball beautifully, which led Hazard into the box.
Hazard came out of the defence and shot from behind Liverpool 's Alison Baker with his left foot and sent him off the net.
Liverpool will now face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 3pm.
Chelsea will face each other in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London via videotune.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The country's disaster agency reported early Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had risen to 832.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference that a 7.5-magnitude earthquake and a 20-foot tsunami on Friday reported several people trapped in the rubble.
In the city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, many buildings collapsed, leaving the city covered in rubble.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing a woman to death.
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was recovered in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman found at 7.55am in John Street, Grayson Muse, with stab wounds, has been taken into custody in connection with a 32-year-old man suspected of the crime.
The police questioned the people living in the area and tried to find out if anyone had seen or heard anything in this context.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation has begun, but I would like to appeal to those who were present in the area around John Street in Birkehead at the time of the incident, if any of them suspected to have seen or heard about the incident, to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to those, especially taxi drivers, who have captured anything on the dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information that is important to our investigation.'
A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was recovered from the local area of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, people who knew the woman arrived at the scene and asked where her body was found this morning.
Police are investigating the incident and say they will inform the victim's family soon.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse is just trying to evacuate his flat, but police have reported that no one is allowed inside or outside the building.
When he found out about the incident, he became silent.
People living nearby are now being told that it will take a few hours to get back to normal.
A police officer heard from a person that the whole area was now being considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She kept saying, 'This is terrible.'
At 2 pm two vans full of police went inside the perimeter while another van was parked outside the perimeter.
Several officers stood inside the perimeter of the blocks of flats for surveillance.
If a person has any information, he can tell the DM at @MerPolCC, or call 101 or contact anonymously at 0800 555 111 by referring to log 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in front of Parliament has recently become the most famous monument, it was re-entered in the history.
His exile would be the ideal justice for his Taliban - like destruction of many of England 's cultural and religious artifacts created by his radical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick 's suggestion as "stupid" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The current debate over the removal of the statues was overwhelmingly concerned that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
The English Civil War emblem was neither ordered nor made by Cromwell.
It may be wrong to think that Cromwell would have sacrificed himself for the works of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
According to Sir William Hemo Thoroughcroft, Cromwell's excellent representation is evidence of the 19th century idea and part of the history of a statue that many still consider admirable.
"Cromwell is revered by many, perhaps for this reason most people still know him as the protector of Parliament against outside pressures in the late 19th century when it came to monarchy", reported Mr. Goldsmith to The Sunday Telegraph.
Nevertheless, they are considered to be quite accurate representatives, which remains a matter of debate historically.
It is obvious that our nation has been evolving since the conflict in the mid - 17th century, and the statue of Cromwell remains a personal identity that reflects one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are commendable and memorable.
A deadly pig attacked a Chinese farmer, killing the farmer.
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked by a pig in a market in southwestern China, killing the farmer.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", had severe injuries, and his body was found covered in blood near a pig farm in the market of Liupansui, Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig pen.
He reportedly came to the market on Wednesday with his cousin, who lives in the nearby Yunnan province, to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin died and the door to a nearby pigsty was found to be open.
He said that he saw a very large male pig in the pig - pen with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked and killed the farmer.
According to the Guiyang Evening News, his cousin, surnamed Wu, said, "My cousin's legs were covered in blood and completely wounded".
Security camera footage showed Yuan coming to the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was recovered after about an hour.
The pig that attacked and killed the man was not Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was kept locked up so that it could not attack a person, although police took a survey of the scene and gathered evidence.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, there have been rare cases of pigs attacking people in the past.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband on their farm, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a Welsh farmer on his tractor, attacking the farmer until his wife scared the animal away.
In 2012, an Oregon farmer was attacked by his pigs and killed to make his own food, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but they can be "dangerous" if they taste blood.
"They are just playing.
They bite with their teeth and are very discerning... they're not meant to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa caused heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves into the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Winds of 85 mph were recorded at Rosa at 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, a Category 1 storm, and it was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving toward the west coast of the U.S. Since Rosa is due to reach the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, much tropical moisture will begin to flow into the northern areas of the southwestern U.S.
On Monday, parts of Mexico will get 10 inches of rain due to Rosa.
After that, moisture from the trench will combine with tropical moisture in the coming days to bring heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will lead to dangerous floods, debris runoff and landslides in the desert.
Excessive tropical humidity will cause rainfall to be 2 to 3 inches in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Most of the southwestern part, especially Arizona, is likely to get 2 to 4 inches of rain.
The sporadic nature of tropical rainfall can cause severe flooding with poor conditions.
In view of the risk of tropical rainfall, it will be strongly advised to stay out of low-level deserts.
Heavy rainfall could make the valleys dangerous rivers and cause thunderstorms, high winds and dust to blow in local areas.
The coming trough will bring locally heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coast.
Over half an inch of rainfall is likely to fall, causing some debris to flow and slippery conditions on the roads.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Some intermittent tropical rainfall will begin in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before the rainfall becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday evening.
Heavy rainfall will continue in the Four Corners on Tuesday till Wednesday.
Temperatures can change rapidly across the U.S. in October as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics get hotter.
Sometimes this short distance causes strange temperature changes.
The strange temperature change in the central US on Sunday is a good example.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the weather will start to warm up and the heat will increase due to the heat.
Warmer weather is expected in most of the central and eastern U.S. from October, with temperatures in the 80s in parts of the northeast ranging from the southern plains.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that there is a strong chance that the temperature in the eastern US will remain above average in the first six months of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Cavanough hearing.
More than 20 million people watched the Supreme Court hearing of Brett Cavanough and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on Thursday, the hearing was shown on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political deadlock was also seen, with broadcasters suspending the regular program of Friday's Last-Minute Twist: An Agreement Engineered by Arizona Sen. The lawsuit was filed by FBI's Jeff Flake after a week of investigating the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Cavanough had drugged him and tried to undress him at a high school party.
In his defence, Cavanagh said he was absolutely certain that this did not happen at all.
It is estimated that more than 20.4 million people watched the Nielsen report on Friday.
The company was calculating the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures for PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network as well as other channels showing it were not immediately available.
Also, Nielsen usually has some difficulty counting the number of people he sees in offices.
In this view, it is equivalent to the number of viewers of a playoff football game or an Academy Awards.
Nielsen reported that Fox News, which has been heavily supported by the opinion-giving host for Cavanough's appointment, topped all channels, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearings.
ABC had a viewership of 3.26 million and came in second.
There were 3.1 million viewers on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN, Nielsen reported.
The audience was very interested.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
A post-term statement from the liberal Republican's office saying he would speak out on behalf of Cavanough, who appeared on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning, at which time protesters were shouting to protest the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes bowed for a few minutes while being called a swear word, which was seen live on CNN.
A woman said, "Look, I'm standing right here in front of you.
"Do you think they are telling the country the right thing?
They were asked, "Did you come to power to make many women powerless?"
Flake said a statement from his office was issued before the elevator was closed and said he would be able to make his full statement at the committee hearing.
While the Judiciary Committee was moving Cavanough's nomination for a vote to the full Senate, cable and broadcast channels were still showing everything live hours later.
But, Flake said, they would do so with the full understanding that the FBI would review the charges against the nominees next week, as the minority Democrats are urging.
Flake talked about it with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After consulting with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake was passionate about power, because it was clear that approving Cavanough without an investigation would not win the Republican vote.
President Trump has approved an FBI investigation into the allegations against Cavanough.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "politicising Brexit".
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May told critics to stop playing with Britain's future by making "politics a game" in the EU and focus on the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May may attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29th September 2018.
Right next to his interview, his former foreign secretary Boris Johnson was printed on the front page of the newspaper, in which Boris Johnson tried to suppress the attack on him because of the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, his statement that Britain and the EU should keep pace with each other, which is "completely meaningless".
Shot at Wade Sims: Police detain a suspect, Dayton Simpson, for the death of an LSU player
Police detained a suspect for shooting and killing Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was taken into custody and sent to jail on a charge of second-degree murder.
A video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson was released by authorities, and police reported that Sims' glasses were lost during the encounter.
The police recovered the glasses from the scene and said that the DNA was found to be Simpson's, according to a WAFB report linked to CBS.
Simpson was questioned by police who said he shot Wade to death.
The lawyer 's report said that he was set to pay $350,000 for this.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released an initial report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local people who cooperated in the investigation for the detention.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement in the area for its "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 6 feet 6 inches tall, raised in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne, who also played basketball for LSU, lives.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in last season's game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "distraught" and "very saddened" by Wade's death.
"There will always be a concern about who will take his place", Wade said.
Volcanic ash found in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has been found in the southern areas of Mexico's capital.
Following the activity of the volcano's crater, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano on Saturday, reporting 183 gas and ash outbursts in 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring for a number of shocks and pulsations.
Photos posted on social media showed thin layers of ash-coated car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Exochimilco.
In September 2017, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico, since when geophysicists have been noticing increasing activity of the volcano which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The volcano, named "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the occasion of the Independence Vote Anniversary
Six people from Barcelona were detained after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police on Saturday, and thousands of opponents joined protests on the first anniversary of the vote on secession in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists threw eggs and powdered paint at riot police, blacking out the road dust, causing trouble for commuters in general.
The police used their batons to suppress the clash and then fought back.
Pro-independence groups chanted "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" for hours while union protesters chanted "Spain Live Forever".
According to local press reports, fourteen people injured by the demonstration were treated.
The October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, has been fueling tensions in the independent-minded areas for a year, but Catalonia's separatist-minded people were celebrating.
Voters chose a very good path for independence, although there were few who strongly opposed voting against the separation.
About 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent people from moving to polling stations in the region amid clashes, Catalan officials said.
The pro-independence groups stayed overnight on Friday to assist the National Police in suppressing the demonstration.
The demonstration was continued, but he was forced to make a different decision.
Electrician Narcisse Terminas, 68, who arrived with his wife to take part in the separatist protest, said he saw no prospect of Catalonia's independence.
Our best year was last year.
I had seen my parents express joy by voting, but now it seems we are stuck, he said.
Despite a small victory in regional elections last December, Catalonia's pro-independence parties struggled to maintain influence this year with many of their popular leaders, whether it was in exposing themselves or in organising the ballot and waiting for a blockade for their role in the continuing declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone to help police, said the clash between politicians from both sides had been stopped.
She said, "It's getting too stressful".
On Saturday, Orol Junqueres, one of nine Catalan leaders held in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"Fighting the European elections as a candidate is the best way to condemn the return to democratic values and the return we have seen in the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Car-crashers arrested
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested for repeatedly attacking a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident took place at Ballynagar Crescent at around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blemings said the doors and building were damaged.
In some places the crossbow may have been attacked by a car.
Menga won 1-0 against Rangers against Livingston.
Dolly Menga 's first goal ensured Livingston 's victory
Livingston's fast pace surprised Rangers, leaving Steven Gerrard to take responsibility for only his second defeat in 18 games, according to Ibrox's club manager.
Dolly Menga's strike made the difference that was equalized by Gary Holt's side move with Hibernian in the second half of the match.
Gerrard's side are one step away from winning this season's Premiership and will face the leaders Hearts next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Earlier, on Thursday, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston is on a six-game winning streak in the division with the addition of head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed showing the visitor his game.
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, and his excellent game caused Rangers to have a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke the record but was behind in the goal attempt, then Allen Lithgow slipped to his best effort to keep straight to complete the goal in Craig Hulket's header.
The hosts got a chance to play against the Rangers, they knew they could get the visitors in trouble on set piece.
And that's how he got the important goal.
The Rangers got a free-kick and Livingston opened, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked to set up Menga, who made a touchdown and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had consolidated their position, but missed home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was far behind,
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos pushed Kelly to save.
Scott Pittman's shot was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor with his feet and Lithgow took full control of the game with a flick from another Livingston.
Crosses in the Livingston box kept coming and continued until a goal was scored, while two penalty claims were made after Halkett's challenge, one involving bringing in Glenn Middleton and the other on handball.
Analysis of Livingston's 'extraordinary goal'
BBC Scotland 's Alasdair Lamont was included in Tony MacArthur Arena
Livingston's extraordinary performance and result.
For any individual, he was great, he continues to raise expectations on this rising trajectory.
His playing style and personality have changed dramatically since his return from the top flight, but most of the credit goes to Holt for the way he has reshaped the team since his arrival.
There were many great players in it.
Captain Hulket was a great player, he saved brilliantly, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warl behind him.
However, the Rangers lacked learning.
The kind of great performance he has had under Gerard many times was below his standard.
They were short of the final ball - they had only managed to cut towards their home side opening once - and it was like some wake-up call for the Rangers, who kept themselves in mid-table.
Erdogan received a warm welcome in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday, smiles were scattered but to no avail.
This is President Erdogan's last day on a controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
He became embroiled in controversies over a range of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan talked about building a huge new mosque in Cologne.
The city is one of the most populated areas outside Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque citing security reasons, but many supporters flocked to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan - some of them Kurds - also chanted slogans, strongly condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The bipartisan protests saw a split between those who welcomed the visitor, some of whom considered him a German-Turkish hero and others who insulted him as a self - seeking ruler.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist killed after being hit by car
A cyclist died in London after being hit by a car.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 BST in the southeastern area of the city, near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford.
The driver of the car stopped the car and gave him first aid, but the man died at the scene.
Another cyclist died a few months ago in a hit and run on Childress Street, about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said that officers were working to identify the man and provide information to his family.
The incidents are being caused by bending of road and bus diversion and drivers are advised to avoid such areas.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured due to disturbance
The prison office said six prison officers were injured due to a disturbance at the high security men's prison.
Some disturbance occurred at HMP Long Lartin, Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been called in to fix the mess, which is in a wing housing eight prisoners.
The rights had minor facial injuries at the scene which were treated.
A prison service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been retained to recover from the accident at HMP Long Lartin.
The injuries of six employees have been treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons at all, and it is obvious that those responsible for violence will be referred to the police and may be jailed.
More than 500 prisoners are held at HMP Long Larin, some of whom are among the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor was attacked by a prisoner, after which the prison governor was treated in hospital.
Furthermore, riot officials were called to the jail in October last year to fix a serious disorder, during which the employee was attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening to cause severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Dry areas may benefit)
Tropical conditions remain dangerous after Hurricane Rosa hit Arizona, but it is already highly likely that this is what the storm's remaining capacity could do to the Desert Southwest in the coming week, leaving it at risk of severe flooding.
Earlier on Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service announced that severe flooding was expected in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, as well as southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah in western Arizona.
Monday evening's rain is expected to make the roost go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service tweeted, "Ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 alone!"
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the AZZ range".
The latest National Hurricane Center model has predicted that up to 2 to 4 inches of rain may fall in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona, with up to 6 inches of rain likely.
1 to 2 inches of rainfall is likely in the Central Rockies and Great Basin as well as other areas of the Desert Southwest, with up to 4 inches of rainfall expected.
Outside areas at risk of severe flooding, the Rosa rain can be a boon as the area is dry.
Although flooding remains a serious concern, drought conditions in the Southwest are still expected to benefit from the rain.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona is in severe drought, the second highest category of drought, weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph on Sunday morning, was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico at the time and is now moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is currently in the cold waters of the Pacific and is losing its strength.
Thus, it is expected that the force of the tropical storm could cause landslides in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rain is likely in some areas of Mexico, which could increase the risk of flooding.
According to a report by weather.com, it is expected that 3 to 6 inches of rain will fall in northwestern Sonora from Baja California, with a further 10 inches likely.
Rosa then moved northward into Arizona on Tuesday morning before moving northward across Mexico to become a tropical storm, before moving southward into Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The greatest risk from Rosa or its remnants is Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest where heavy rain is likely", reports the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these rains could cause rapid flooding and debris flows in the deserts, threatening the livelihoods of the people and causing landslides in the hilly areas.
Attack in Midsummer Norton: Four people arrested for conspiracy to murder
A 16-year-old minor was found wounded, stabbed and stabbed in Somerset for which the suspect has been detained in connection with a plot to murder three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man.
The teenage boy was found in a wounded state at around 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton.
He was taken to hospital for treatment where his condition is being described as "well".
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were detained overnight from the Redstock area.
The authorities have also appealed to the public to contact if anyone has any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump described the troubles of the Kavanaughs as the anger of the Democratic Party.
"Judge Cavanaugh is a man who has been rejected by the ruthless and demeaning tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump told a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says the trouble the Cavanaughs are going through is the result of Democratic Party anger during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh cleared Congress of a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Ford as a teenager decades earlier, a claim which Kavanaugh forcefully and emotionally denied in the course of the clearance.
During the hearing, Ford also gave his testimony about the allegation.
"The American people saw the virtues and courage of Kavanaugh as a great man that day", the president said on Saturday.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting for a man who is the most accomplished jurist of our time, who can uphold the law and do justice with a real record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in medieval elections, the President referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh.
We are now just five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
I am not involved, but I am involved", he said.
"That is why I am running for all the candidates who are truly worthy".
Trump said Democrats are on a campaign to "resist and block".
A senior GOP aide told CNN that the first count of votes in the Senate nomination of Kavanaugh is due to begin on Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the death toll is rising
When a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, high waves began to rise in the sea, killing at least 384 people, officials said on Saturday.
A festival was being held on the beach in the city of Palo on Friday with hundreds of people gathered when after dark, a six-meter (18-foot) high wave caused havoc, killing many people and destroying everything around them.
The tsunami followed a 7. 5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami risk occurred yesterday, people on the beach were busy with their activities and were not in a position to evacuate immediately and were trapped", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami not only killed people, but also washed cars, logs and houses onto the ground. The tsunami traveled at 800 km/h (497 mph) on the open sea before striking the beach", said Nugroho.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palu.
Photos posted from the plane by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were bent and collapsed and a mosque was also surrounded by water.
The aftershock continued on the rocks in the coastal town on Saturday.
2.4 million people in the area experienced the continuous earthquake.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy output from Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It said the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho detailed the damage as "terrible" and said it caused thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels to collapse.
He said that some bodies were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured while 29 people are still missing.
The area known as Dongola, 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu near the epicentre, is likely to have a high casualty rate, Nugroho said.
Nugroho said the communication system in Dongola was "completely damaged".
In a statement, the Red Cross said more than 300,000 people were living here and its staff and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
It said, "This is already a tragic event, but it could be even more terrible".
On Saturday, the agency criticized why it was not informed earlier if a tsunami was coming to Palo, although officials said a warning was about to be issued but the waves had already passed.
A video was amateurised and posted on social media by a person who can be seen on the top floor of the building, with a person being yelled at from the street below and a scary warning being heard.
Within minutes, a huge amount of water started pouring out of the beach, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was not able to immediately verify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power problems in Palu and cut communication lines, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
With the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities have started sending cargo planes, officials said, with people still needing to be evacuated and food as well as other necessities met.
The city's airport has reopened for relief efforts only and will close in October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
This is terrible.
Mr. Doseba said that World Vision staff in Donggala, who have been living in the city of Palu by building tirpal shelters in their office premises, have seen the devastation firsthand.
He said, "On talking to them, I found out that they saw many houses destroyed.
This is terrible.
Aid groups began to bring in relief supplies in earnest, with some complaining that outside aid workers with specialised skills were being denied access to the palus.
According to Indonesian regulations, money, supplies and personnel can only be taken from abroad if the disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
But, it has not been done yet.
"The disaster is still at the provincial level", said Aulaya Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Only after the government says that OK, this is a national disaster, can we involve international aid workers in the rescue operation but this has not happened yet".
Those who were still missing friends and family members in Palo after the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday were hoping that their loved ones would be miraculously found somewhere, as happens after natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was found trapped in the sewer.
Rescue teams pulled a woman from the rubble on Sunday with her baby trapped in the rubble for two days.
Indonesian National Paragliding Team coach Gendan Subando trained two Asian Games paragliders to locate missing people, who had been dedicated to it since the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandgi was among those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel with his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I am also emotionally depressed.
Mr Gendon said that the paragliding community started its work after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel, they sent messages via WhatsApp to the Palu competitors participating in the Beach Festival.
However, only gray marks were seen on his message, not blue marks.
He said, "I think it means that the message didn't reach people".
Thieves stole $26,750 while putting money into an ATM in Newport, La.
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, a Brink employee was putting money into an ATM in Newport, La., on Friday morning when thieves stole $26,750.
In a news release, the Deputy Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to deposit more money.
While he was busy with his work, a man came running from behind the employee of Brink and ran away with the bag of money he had put in.
According to the release, many people at the scene are suspected, but the police have not yet been able to determine the total number of people at the scene.
Anyone with information regarding their identity should call Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to this.
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to this.
He tweeted about the change on Saturday: "Officially, his name will be Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using his name for a while and will use it for the title moniker of his eighth album, released in June.
This is being a change in his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album Yandi.
The show's producer said they had removed singer Ariana Grande from the show who had "refused to join the show for emotional reasons".
As well as shortening his current professional name, West had already indicated that the word had religious significance for him.
Talking to radio host Big Boy about the title of his album earlier this year, West said, "I believe the word 'ye' is used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means 'you'.
So I am you, I am we, this is us.
It comes from the word Kanye, which means one, which is just this - it represents our good, our bad, our delusion, everything.
The album is about who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs also has many names, such as, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has kept his names Love and Brother Love when announcing for the name.
An old friend of West's, Jay-Z, has also changed his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico vows not to use force against civilians
On the country's 50th anniversary of deadly reprisals against students, Mexican presidential candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador vowed that military force would never again be used against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised at the Teltelco Plaza on Saturday that "military force will never be used to put pressure on the Mexican people".
The soldiers opened fire on a peaceful protest in the Plaza on October 2, 1968, killing more than 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were spreading throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help Mexico's youth, giving scholarships to students every month and opening more and more free public universities.
He said that youth are among the criminals due to unemployment and low educational opportunities.
The US should double the funding for AI.
Kai-Fu Li, a low-cost investor and AI entrepreneur for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field.
AI has made this comment after a number of U.S. government works, he also said that the U.S. lacks an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China launched a plan: its goal is to reach number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a great start, but if you look at all the other countries separately, the U.S. is way behind in this, and we're working on the next big breakthrough of AI", Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said, "Doubling the funding could double the likelihood that AI's next big breakthrough will be in the U.S".
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, an investor in Face++, one of China's top AI companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that far surpassed the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later he was appointed to an executive position at Microsoft Research and a president at Google's China branch.
Lee highlighted the technical capabilities of the previous US government, including the robotics-related challenges of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and said who will be the next government to identify the next visionary.
Lee said U.S. researchers often face considerable difficulties in obtaining government support.
"It's not China that is removing academic leaders, it's the corporate", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university veterans to work on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the US with its AI efforts.
He said, "I think that a green card should allow you to do a PhD in AI automatically.
In July 2017, China's State Council released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
Li said that while the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide financial grants to U.S. researchers in the same way that the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds academic institutes, the quality of teaching in China is not very good.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense opened a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, aiming to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Further, this month DARPA launched an initiative called AI Next, which talks about a $2 billion investment.
For NSF, right now, this investment is over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, legislation passed in the US would ignore demands for a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians voted on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had caused Greece to suspend its membership bids in the European Union and NATO.
There is also a province in Greece called Macedonia, which says its northern neighbor is named after its territory, giving it two names for the same claim and is already in NATO and the European Union.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents opposed it, saying that renaming Macedonia would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority people living in Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and boycott the campaign, doubting that the minimum 50 percent required for the vote would be valid.
The ballot will say: 'Do you approve of the agreement with Greece for NATO and EU membership?'
Prime Minister Zoran Zev and supporters of the name change say it is important for Macedonia to join bodies like the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, this future is for young people in Macedonia, it will allow them to live freely under the umbrella of the EU because it means a safe life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska, 79, from Skopje.
Legally, however, there is no push for it, with most members of parliament saying they will work according to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two - third majority is required for a name change in Parliament.
The State Election Commission says that as of 1 pm there were no reports of irregularities.
However, in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when the voter turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent, 66 per cent of registered voters cast their ballots.
Gozo Tanewski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje, said: "I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe".
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zev, with his wife Zorica and son Dushko, went to Macedonia to vote on the country's name change, so that the country's name would join NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018 in Stromika, Macedonia.
Vladimir Kvardarkov, 54, from Skopje, was setting up a small stage in front of the parliament and setting up chairs in front of the tents set up by those who were going to oppose the vote.
"We want NATO and EU membership, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through an agreement", said Kavadarkov.
Our country is poor, but we have our own self - esteem.
If they don't want us to join as Macedonia, it doesn't matter, we can join other countries like China and Russia to be part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zeev said that NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
After casting his vote, Zeev said, "I think a lot of the vote will be positive because more than 80 percent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO".
He said the "yes" result would "confirm our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the required poll.
A second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV on Sunday showed 57 percent of people planning to vote.
Of these, 70 percent agreed to vote yes.
More than 50 percent of the votes are required for a successful vote.
If the vote fails, the policy of the Western government formed in May last year will take the first serious blow.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero forces the whole of Brighton to defend to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling had a strong defense against Brighton in Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester City, England on Saturday.
Ironically, Aguero scored his own easy goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was passed into midfield in the opening round.
He defended against three Brighton players as he went into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposing players.
He pushed a defender before moving forward from the corner of the Brighton box.
Then, finding Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
The English forward in the box used his first touch to return the ball to Aguero, Aguero used his left boot to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan and the ball went out of his right side into the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his legs that are bothering him", city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that they scored at that moment.
But, it was because of Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early lead in the Premier League clash.
In the 29th minute, he scored.
In that game Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's field.
He got the ball out of Leroy Sen's left side beautifully.
Sen made a few touches before sending off Sterling, who was playing well.
The Sky Blues tapped the ball forward just before it slipped out of the game hand.
The Champions League group play will now be played from Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Cinsim, Germany.
The Shazers want to beat him by playing the Rockies.
After the playoff dispute with the Nationals was over, there was no big reason to push for another start.
But, the ever-competitive Skeeter is hoping to score big against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but the playoffs remain a possibility for the Rockies, who have won the game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to clinch their first division title.
"Even if we are not playing very well, we can at least play to know that the atmosphere of Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably be for the highest level of play I will face this year.
Why wouldn 't I want to play that game ? "
The Nationals are yet to be told about the starter for Sunday, but there are rumors that Shazer could be included in such a situation.
Shazer, playing for his 34th start, risked a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch at his normal on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the President referred to the situation around his Supreme Court in a letter to Brett Kavanaugh.
"All the work we have done will be at stake in November.
We are now just five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
He said, "This is a very big election - I am not involved, but I am involved because I am fighting for all the great candidates".
Trump added, "You can look at this very, very terrible group of radical Democrats, you can see all the things that are happening right now.
Moreover, they are trying to seize power by other necessary means, which you know are futile and useless.
To gain power and control, they don't care who's unhappy, who's deserving, they just want power and control to come to them, but we won't let that happen.
He said the Democrat campaign is "to oppose and obstruct".
"Besides, you can see what has happened in the last four days, you can see the anger of the Democrats and also see how mean and bad they are.
Referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he mentioned the name of Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein, who was applauded by the audience.
Remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
What.
No, no, I'm waiting for the one whose body language was really bad -- the first bad body language I've ever seen.
Working is no longer a broad church.
It is not for those who speak from their own heart.
When the activists who pushed my local party forward voted to elect me, it was a big surprise to me.
After all, I am the newest among those Labour MPs whose importance has been greatly diminished - we cannot say everything we think.
This is what happened to my fellow MP, John Ryan, because he also spoke out against antisocialism.
In my case, the censor motion condemned me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
There were similar problems in Europe on the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, which Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders on.
"We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive", it said on Friday for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting.
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, I have mostly seen Friday night GC meetings stay exactly the same.
Sadly, many meetings today do not agree or promise that the politics of "kind and gentle people" are really forgotten, as happened here.
It is obvious that differences of opinion in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that each opinion is decided on by the party leadership.
It started right here, right after Jeremy became leader, with colleagues who I had previously thought had the same political views as me expecting me to back down and take positions that I could never agree with - whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak out for the public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - I get bad words on social media, sharp comments, condemnation of the politics of the centre and being told I am not worthy of the Labour Party.
Besides, it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are politically connected.
I know how businessmen work and I am dedicated to colleagues who always face sexual or racial abuse, but do not shy away from speaking out.
There are many frustrating aspects of the current political era, one of which is how to normalize the levels of abuse.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn claimed that it was important for the Labour Party to promote a culture of intolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the Broad Church and the changes in the party selection rules for every motion of "disbelief" are very few.
Over the past two years, many people have advised me and urged me to be quiet, not talk too much, and then I will be "considered right".
But I did not come to politics for this.
32 years ago, when I was involved in labor as a schoolboy, I was urged to protest the Thatcher government, told to leave my school's broad classroom altogether, I demanded better public services for those who needed them most - whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden any of my politics, including the politics of the last election.
There is not a single person in Nottingham East who has any doubts about my policy position and any area of disagreement about my current leadership.
To all those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not see the need to waste my time and energy in showing my sincerity to the Labour Party.
But, in fact, I have a message not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my supporters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to be serving you and I promise that no uncertain risks or political campaigns can hinder my work, I am only interested in what is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East
Ire 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ire reach the top
Two late attempts may have had some effect on the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr Tennant deserved to win this most entertaining match of the Premiership.
Now they are only at the top of the table with ten unbeaten sides.
In the end, his defense was excellent, he got the best opportunity he could, which led the home team to the lead and gave coach Peter Murchi a chance to be happy.
"We have thoroughly checked our game and we are still unbeaten, so I am happy", he said.
"The credit goes to Ayr, who made the most of his opportunity", said Melrose's Robin Christie.
A 14th minute effort by Grant Anderson forced Frazier Klimo to come in front of Ayr, but the Warriors gave a yellow card to Scotland player Rory Hughes for the game, who had a chance to score for Melrose and Jason Bagan for a very difficult effort.
With the help of a penalty just before half-time, Klimo extended Ayr, scored and then tried to tie the match 17-5 at half-time for Ayr.
But Melrose was better in the second half and Baggott converted Patrick Anderson's effort into a goal, reducing Leavey's five points.
After that, Ruridhih Knott suffered a serious injury that caused him to stop the game for a long time, he was stretched, then after the game started, Iyer tried to advance through Stafford McDowall which was converted into a goal by Klimo.
At the time, Ayr's captain Blair McPherson had received a yellow card, and then due to the pressure at the end of the game, Melrose gave an extra man Bruce Calvin a try which he failed to cash.
However, the hosts were left behind and when Strouen Hutchinson received a yellow card due to facing a billa ball clime from the penalty line-out, McPherson touched down while pushing Ayr from behind.
After Kelly Rowe collected a box kick from David Armstrong and sent away flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home side, Climo turned it into a goal, as he could have done when the game resumed.
Game stars are still looking for new careers in the restaurant industry
Game star Ford Kieran is still looking for ways to move into the hospitality industry, having recently been tapped to be a director of a licensed restaurant company.
Jack, 56, has joined Jarvis from the popular BBC show, where he writes and acts alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have revealed that the upcoming ninth series will be their last in the show's world, and it seems that they are planning what to do with Keirnan after Craigellaung.
Based on the official record list, he is a director of Adriftmorne Ltd.
The actor declined to comment on the story, yet a Scottish Sun source hinted that Keirnan was looking to join a "big restaurant trade" based in Glasgow.
'We have a right to the sea': Land-locked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Military sailors are on a massive patrol at the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean Blue flags are being flown over government buildings.
The slogan of the naval base, which stretches from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, is: "We have the right to the sea".
It is our duty to recover it.
Bolivia, a coastal country that lost to Chile in a terrible land battle in the 19th century, is still desperate to regain its land - once again, it wants to wave its flag in the Pacific.
Now they hope to regain their Bolivian land decades ago, as it awaits a ruling from an International Court of Justice judge on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"There is a lot of excitement in Bolivia now, a sense of unity and peace, and a positive outcome is about to come as the people here hope", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calajilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the big ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the ruling from the Hague court will be in favor of Bolivia - which has been negotiated for decades - which has been forced through negotiations to return Bolivia's land in the sea.
Bolivia's best-known president, Evo Morales - who faces a contentious contest in next year's re-election - also expressed the positive in his ruling on Monday.
Last August, he said, "We are very close to getting the Pacific Ocean back".
But some analysts believe the court's decision will not be in Bolivia's interest - and if it is, there will be plenty of conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to reward the Chilean province, and has decided not to determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
Paz Zarret, a Chilean expert at the International Court of Justice, said the ICJ's decision comes six months after the final hearing, which indicated the case was not "complicated".
Moreover, contrary to Bolivia's conditions, it seems that for the past four years it may return to its old state.
"The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the current Bolivian government", Jarrett said.
He suggested that Morales' controversial statement had destroyed what goodwill remained in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on certain terms, but once the decision is made, it will be very difficult to negotiate this time.
Since 1962, ambassadors of both countries have not been living in each other's country.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Velázquez, representing Bolivia in The Hague, denied that the court's decision was unusually hasty.
He said Monday would be a "great opportunity for Bolivia to open up new paths to relations with Chile" and "to end 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit".
Calazilla has rejected the idea that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was politicizing the maritime issue.
He said Bolivia would never back down for its right to access the Pacific Ocean.
Decisions are a chance to learn what we needed to do in the past.
North Korea has said it will not stop nuclear testing until it trusts the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will not destroy its nuclear bomb unless Washington is trusted.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during the Singapore Summit between the leaders of the other countries.
He commented that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo feels he is about to resume nuclear diplomacy more than three months after North Korea's Kim Jong Un made promises in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that would see the North surrender to sanctions and US objections to the declaration of an end to the Korean War.
Washington is wary of agreeing to a major disarmament operation already underway without Pyongyang's declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But it is highly doubtful that Pyongyang is serious about ending its nuclear bomb inspection because it does not want to jeopardize the country's security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit of Kim-Trump's own accord.
The Paris Fashion Show featured a variety of newly designed headwear for your nearest high street.
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely protect your head from the sun, you don't have to wait much longer.
Both Valentino and Thom Brown have created a line of top headdresses for their SS19 collection on the runway, which featured in the famous Paris Fashion Week of special style.
The best useful hats are made to survive this year's heat and these designers have sent their beautiful creations to showcase at the show.
The best hats Valentino made were quite large, decorated with a wide, feathery rim that hung around the model's head.
Other accessories with a much larger side included waterlemon hats with bezel designs, wizard hats and pineapple hats - but they are not designed to protect your head from frost.
Tom Brown also showed off specially designed masks - and they can only be used in time for Halloween.
People were amazed by the many colorful masks and more Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
One creation showed all kinds of scuba diving equipment including snow globes and glasses, while the other creation showed a design with a melting ice cream cone.
Also, if you've seen the bigger fashions - you're in luck.
Fashion lovers predict that this fine collection could soon reach the fine shops near you.
The oversized hat will come with a heel designed to bomb the two-foot wide straw hat, which will be available to everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The top hat had a cult label on the back which looked pretty, with the second creation posted on social media featuring a catwalk - featuring the model wearing a swimsuit on a straw beach bag.
The burnt orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringing and fitted with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquimus' La Rivera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion celebrity Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I hope that big hats and beach bags will be in stores soon for the upcoming summer season - because designers have been so impressed that the demand for larger-sized accessories will be hard to ignore.'
JE: It's important for foreigners to have language skills.
Private schools in Scotland have a track record of excellent education, and since 2018 alone have continued to deliver excellent test scores, strengthening individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
Over 30,000 students across Scotland are affiliated with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), whose leadership these schools strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
The aim of private schools is to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places are benefiting citizens of foreign countries.
As an education sector that can design and implement the school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be chosen as popular and desirable subject options in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, you become better for him.
If you speak to him in his own language, it is very pleasing to his heart.
When we want to build relationships and trust people in other countries, we think we can rely on English more.
In the recent exam results of this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table with the highest pass rates in private schools.
Of these, 68 per cent are students who have achieved the highest grade of A in foreign languages.
Data collected by 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72 per cent of students achieved the highest grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of students achieved the highest grade A in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are collaborating in foreign languages to give children and young people the skills they will need in the future.
Languages are now being included as optional subjects in private school curricula and among other things, like STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers struggled to recruit staff to fill vacancies, with 17 per cent of candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming imperative that young people have more and more language skills to prepare them for their future careers.
These skills are essential to work anywhere in the world because of the high potential employment opportunities that language requires.
Whatever career options are chosen, if people have learned a second language, such skills will surely benefit them in the future.
If you are able to talk directly to foreigners, being a multilingual person will automatically put you ahead of the competition.
In 2013, more than 4,000 adults in the UK took part in a YouGov survey, according to which 75 percent of them could not speak a foreign language well enough and only 15 percent could speak French, the only language to reach the double-digit percentage.
That is why it is important to invest in language education for children today.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing economies, will help children have better chances of finding the right job.
The languages taught in each school in Scotland will be different.
There are also many schools that will focus more on classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are geared towards 2020 and are considered the most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what language your child is interested in learning, they will always be able to choose that language in private schools and they will also have staff to teach it who are experts in the field.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children for the future and give them the skills they need to succeed so that they can thrive in the future.
For the global business environment, it cannot be ruled out that learning languages in the country is very important for the future, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages should be accepted as truly "international communication skills".
The choice to choose this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland will continue to be offered by private schools.
Il faut bien le faire. It is the right thing to do.
The director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools is John Edward
In San Diego on Sunday, LeBron started as a member of the Lakers.
Now the wait for fans of LeBron James is about to end as he will soon play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James has been selected as the preseason opener for Sunday's game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But, how many minutes they will play is yet to be decided.
The Lakers announced via their official website that they will play at least one minute and at most 48 minutes.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
He said, "At this stage of my career, I don 't need to be ready for a preseason game. "
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
In Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump had a big rally tonight for his campaign.
Trump has scheduled five more rallies next week, including in Tennessee and Mississippi, as well as other favorable locations.
With the vote set to be suspended in his election for a vacant Supreme Court appointment, Trump's goal is to seek help for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk being out of Congress' control by the time the vote is counted in November.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7pm ET.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump may speak at this week's hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, whose confirmation of the Senate vote, expected during an FIT investigation, has been delayed for a week because of sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh.
But the main aim of this tense environment of rallies is to help Republicans face the elections in November.
According to Reuters, President Trump said during the campaign, "All five rallies next week are aimed at energizing volunteers and supporters as part of a Republican effort to protect and increase his blocked majority in the Senate and House of Representatives".
According to Reuters, a spokesman who was removed from Trump's campaign said: "Control of Congress has become so important to his agenda that the president will only visit states where our campaign season will be busiest.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally at Wheeling's Westbank Arena could bring Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters to the attention of Pittsburgh media.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, the state from which he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is coming forward to try to help Patrick Morris, the candidate who trails in the West Virginia Republican Senate poll.
According to Reuters, West Virginia University political scientist Simon Hayder said: "If the president is trying to push Morris to the front in the election, it's not a good sign for him".
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed willingness to compete to maintain their hopes of staying on top in Sunday singles
After three one-off sessions, the fourth session on Saturday afternoon will give the result of what is going to happen in this Ryder Cup.
The cycle of time is a completely new concept for players, but in competitions like this, it is impossible to predict when which player will get ahead and which player to trust.
So, what will they say about this momentum now?
As we walked through the day, Jordan Speith said, "They had a six-point lead, now it's down to four, so I think we need to pick up the pace a little bit".
Of course, Europe had the advantage and led by four points with 12 points in the game.
According to Speeth, the American feels he has little to no chances left and much to encourage, not only from Speeth's form but also from the form of Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both scored three points from four of their games.
Speeth is deadly to everyone from T to Green and is also the best in the game.
The crowd cheered enthusiastically as their game progressed, as he and Thomas put in the crucial four all-squares to complete, two points down two after one.
It was his putt that put his team in 15th place with the same scream, sort of telling you that you don't think the American team is out of it.
"You really just have to play well and remember that the win is yours", said Spieth.
That is what all the players who are out of the game say.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only two players with more points than Speath and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are making history in the Ryder Cup.
The different styles but better couple from Europe scored four points out of four and are in the lead.
"Mollywood" is the only couple who did not shoot a bogie on Saturday afternoon, but they stayed away from the bogie until before 9am on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday.
On Sunday, he scored and scored in this huge crowd and this huge crowd as if they were the players who were going to beat, and there is no player who could turn a potential European team win into a defeat. It seemed that Le Golf National would go down before Fleetwood or Molinari.
It is better that both are in different holes in different ways.
However, the dignity of Europeans has been discussed for a long time.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it a little easier for foreball hero Sergio Garcia in the morning, at the time his pairing with Alex Noreen was made.
The Spaniard and Swede made a hole in a bogey and two doubles in front of nine dogs, which they had never been able to do before.
However, on Sunday, there was no one present to help you get to your hole.
Foreball and foursome were excellent in appearance because the interaction between pairing was excellent, he advised that he did not need to seek advice and he was well aware of how to change strategy.
Europe as a team played very well and took a significant lead on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the ability to do something that, especially at Stateside, is doubtful.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe led 10 - 6.
Europe will take advantage of the final day of the Ryder Cup after a 10-6 lead over the United States on Saturday in the foursome and foursome matches.
Top pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead over struggling Tiger Woods with two wins to take their match to four points ahead of Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side dominated the morning fours in order to avenge their trophy loss at Hazeltine two years earlier due to a misfiring by the American side which gave them a 3-1 lead in the series.
The U.S. had more resistance in the fourth quarter, winning two games, but they could not avoid losing.
Jim Furyk 's side need eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood are the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari started from "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points in their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reid in the fours, they again beat top players Woods and American rookie Bryson Deschambeau by 5 and 4 points, performing even better than before to defeat Woods and American rookie Bryson Deschambeau.
Woods, who had put up two games on Saturday, had his best performance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 games in the fourball and foursome and seven in the row.
In the remaining morning foursome, Justin Rose returned to the foursome with his partner Henrik Stenson and defeated world ranked number one and three players Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopeca 2-1.
However, the pleasant, breezy day in the southwest of Paris had no break for Europe.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
He won a spectacular 2-1 over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours and sent back Pauls and Rory McIlroy 4-3 on the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a match to reach the singles with four points, although the kind of need Fury's side had kept the trophy in focus.
However, after two days of being second best, the counter-attack on Sunday is going to be something different from their old game.
North Korea said that saying 'no way' would only mean disarmament on one side that could not be trusted.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday the UN has continued sanctions that were based on its distrust of the United States and showed no way the country would abandon testing nuclear bombs on its own behalf in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had tried several "critical goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear bomb and missile tests, demolishing a nuclear test site, and pledging not to pursue nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "However, we have not received any response from the US for this".
"There will be no confidence in our national security without relying on the US in any way and there is no way in which we can initiate unilateral disarmament in these circumstances".
While Ri reiterated that the complaints made by North Korea were about Washington's "phased" approach to disarmament, under which North Korea would gradually start to benefit, his statement made it abundantly clear that this unilateral disarmament cannot be left to one side alone as Pyongyang has done before.
At the first summit between the sitting US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, at which time Kim pledged to work towards "the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang should first stop building its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the lifting of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US has insisted on disarmament first and increased the level of sanctions pressure to achieve its objective by force, Ri said, and at the same time, it has objected to the "declaration of the end of the war".
"The idea that prohibition can bend us is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us.
But the problem is that the constant restrictions are diminishing our confidence even more.
Ri did not discuss plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, saying the US leader had spoken of the merits of the UN last week.
Instead, the minister discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae - in over the past five months, adding: "If the party to this disarmament problem is South Korea and not the US, then the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula will not be involved in such a standoff".
Still, Ri's speech was very different from last year's speech, when he told the U.N. National Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets after Trump, the so-called "Evil President" on a suicide mission, called himself "Rocket Man".
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who had threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, had praised Kim's courage in pushing for disarmament but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia are arguing that Pyongyang should be rewarded for steps taken by the U.N. Security Council.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: "The Security Council sanctions should remain in place until we realize without fail that we are completing a complete, final and verified disarmament".
The Security Council extended sanctions on North Korea in 2006 with full agreement to fund Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would travel to Pyongyang again for a second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not a good one.
He returned from Pyongyang in July and said work had progressed, only hours before North Korea denounced him for "gangster-like demands".
At a Moon meeting this month, North Korea vowed to destroy the missile site and, if the United States takes "appropriate measures", it will also destroy the nuclear complex.
He said Kim had promised him "consistent measures", he was asking for security guarantees that Trump would resolve in Singapore and move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking courses for jobs that are comfortable enough.
Harvard University has launched a new course this year for all its undergraduates who want to get as much relaxation as possible while competing in the growing macho culture for study through caffeinated 'all-nighters'.
The teacher who teaches the world's number one university students often has no choice when it comes to such simple things as what to do to relax themselves.
Charles Kessler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women 's Hospital, has created a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After talking about the effects of poor sleep during teaching, he got the idea to start this course.
He told The Telegraph: 'A girl came to me at the end of the year and said: 'Why do I keep saying I have to go to the next class next year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which shocked me.
This year, when the course is launched for the first time, students will learn how good sleep habits are important for studying and athletic performance, and will also improve their overall health.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's Health Services, said students do not get enough sleep each week, which is why the university decided to launch the course.
The hour long course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there will be an image of a dormitory room where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of sleep time in the routine.
In the second section, participants will be told that lack of adequate sleep may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons will be shown, then participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately", said Professor Zessler.
But we believe they should be aware of this - just as smoking smokes health effects.
He said that while the culture of feeling proud of 'study all night' still exists, modern technology and increasing pressure on students means they have to sleep less which has become a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough and good sleep is like a "secret weapon" for students, it can help them fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - it also prevents the effects on weight as lack of sleep keeps their brain thinking about hunger constantly which makes them feel hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Jessler to create the course, completing his last year class at Harvard during the last year.
He said that the course made him aware and inspired for campus-wide course.
In future, he hopes that it will be considered mandatory for all postgraduate students to complete this course before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Jessler suggested that students should consider setting an alarm before bed, as well as deciding when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' from electronic screens and LED lights, which can put too much circadian on them causing sleep problems.
Livingston vs Rangers 1-0: Menga scored against Gerard
The Rangers were hampered in another match by a strike from Dolly Menga, with the blame for Livingston's 1-0 win being placed on the wrong side of Steven Gerrard.
The Ebro side were looking for their first win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side were upset as manager for a second defeat to Gerrard in 18 games to knock out Landbrooks Premiership leaders Hearts by eight points.
Menga strikes for seven minutes before half time and the Rangers ' line-up short never once has a chance to tie the game.
However, Rangers have now dropped to sixth in the rankings, with Livingston moving up to third and only behind Hibernian due to goal difference.
Furthermore, the game could be even more troublesome for the Rangers since the lineman Calum Spence's head wound has been treated after the object was apparently thrown over the other end.
Eight changes in Gerrard's side saw the last Irishman get a chance to go to the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was included in the same Liv 11 that took a point from Hurtz last week and the way he drilled well gave the opposing team trouble at every turn.
Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played better than them.
When Menga first let-off and sent Scott Pittman towards Alan McGregor's goal, he should have given him just two minutes, but the midfielder seized the big opportunity he had.
When Keegan Jacobs in the deep made the free kick, it went to captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow in the back post could only stab wide.
The Rangers gained control, but in the final third they relied more on hope than on their own play.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he should have taken a penalty at the quarter-over mark because he and Steven Lawless had collided, but referee Steven Thomson had rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers saved two shots on target in the first-half, but former Ibero goalkeeper Liam Kelly struggled with strikes from Lasana Colibri's header and Twy Ovi Azaria.
Although Livy 's opener in the 34th minute could have gone against the run of play, no one can deny that he alone deserves this graft.
Even after this, the Rangers could not outplay the best player in the Deep.
When Deacon Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Orfield showed no interest, with Scott Robinson holding still to pick Menga for a simple finish.
When Gerrard swapped Colibri for Ryan Kent and switched to show immediate impact as he was being slotted by the winger at Morelos, he had taken a break at the time, but Kelly blocked his line with a great run.
But, Livingstone showed the visitors the kind of game they could really enjoy, sweeping the long ball with Lithgow and Hulket after the long ball.
Holt's side could have extended their lead in the final stage, but McGregor prevented Jacobs from stopping well before being cornered wide by Lithgow.
Rangers called up Glenn Middleton, who had been an alternate, claimed another late penalty as they were involved with Jacobs, but Thompson did not let them succeed again.
Elmanak: inventor of the geyser counter
Now a page from our Sunday Morning calendar: 136 years ago today, September 30, 1882 and beyond... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiser invented a device for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later became known as Geiser Counter.
The geyser is a mainstay of counter science, it has become a mainstay of pop culture, and in 1950 a film "Bells of Coronado" was made about it, starring scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans for the first time:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
After you turn on these earphones, you can definitely hear the effects of atoms hidden in minerals due to radioactivity".
Evans: "Show me, right now it's definitely popping!"
"Hans" Geiser passed away in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But his invention has kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccines can target damaged cells in the immune system.
New cancer vaccines can detect and kill damaged cells in the immune system.
The vaccine instructs the immune system to identify damaged cells during treatment
This method can be used to remove and replace a patient's immune cells in a laboratory.
Then, they can be used to detect a protein common to many cancers and then remove it and reattach it.
A trial for a vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman was given the vaccine, which looked at her immune system for defective cells, then it was found that her ovarian cancer, which had been present for more than 18 months, was gone.
This method allows a patient's immune cells to be removed and replaced in the laboratory, so that they "see" a common protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then the cells can be removed and replanted.
"Our results show that the vaccine is very promising", said Professor J. Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Professor Berzofsky said HER2 is responsible for the development of many types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
Removing immune cells from patients and instructing them to detect cancer cells is useful in the treatment of leukemia.
Following her SNL appearance, Kanye West on MAGA Hat denounced Trump's old controversial speech.
It didn't work out.
After Kanye West's brilliant performance, in which she praised US President Donald Trump and said he would remain in office in 2020, she denounced him in the studio during Saturday Night Live.
After a performance of her third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great cap, she denounced the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"So, I talk to white people a lot of times and they say, 'What makes you like Trump, he's a racist?'"
Still, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago.
SNL opened the show with a skit by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked the case of Brett Kavanaugh, it is already known that the Senate Judiciary Committee is already investigating claims of sexual harassment made against him by Christine Blasey Ford.
However, nothing like this was shown, footage of West's condemnation was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It was not disclosed whether Rock was trying to make West laugh with the post because of the post.
Along with this, West complained to the audience that she was threatened to go backstage with her headwear.
"They threatened me backstage.
He said, 'You shouldn 't go there wearing that hat.'
They threatened me!
He also said that I was stuck in the wrong place, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said: "You want to see the wrong place?" Also, he said, "They're going to make a play for my Superman Cape, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Love each other.
In his comments he mentioned the audience at least twice and the SNL cast was felt to be embarrassed, in a separate report one person told the publication: "The whole studio went completely silent".
West was called in due to the delay in arrival of singer Ariana Grande, who had recently lost her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller.
West surprised many by performing on the song I Love It, dressed as Periyar Bottle.
West met again with Candace Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: Thank you for speaking up for the public".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just there "to tell you what he told you and that is absolutely amazing".
"But I did not elect to take advantage of anyone (by buying my music or clothes or supporting my art) who I feel is promoting a wrong idea for my community or misrepresenting my community.
He is free.
That is why we exist", he said.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, adding that he was now "officially going to be known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, but before that did so by Didi and Puffy who were previously named Puff Didi and P Didi respectively.
With him, the rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly known as Snoop Lion and the late Prince of Music famously changed his name to Snoop and the artist was already known as Prince after that.
Attempted stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder, suspected of stabbing a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackmore.
The defendant is expected to appear in the Magistrates Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington has questioned toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is best known for his swordplay role as John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has questioned the role of the macho hero, saying that seeing such roles on screen often inspires many young boys and they feel that such hard work is necessary to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he was sensing 'something was wrong' and asked how to end the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Recently, Kit married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, believing she feels 'strong enough' to talk about the issue.
He said, "Personally, I think very strongly right now -- are we doing something wrong with masculinity?
Are we teaching men that when they grow up, they will have to deal with the problems they see on the screen?'
Kit feels that television may be partly responsible for toxic masculinity, thanks to its overly male-dominated character.
He added: 'What is happening and what is being taught?
What is it about TV and the street that makes young boys believe that they have to do certain things to be a man?
I think this really has become one of the big questions of our time -- how can we change this?
Because it is obvious that something is wrong with the ideas of young men.'
In an interview, he also admitted that when the series Game of Thrones returns at the end of next summer, he will not be participating in any of its prequels or sequels, and added that he has done 'a lot of programs with battlefields and horse riding'.
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's new series True West, which is about a film producer whose brother is a bandit.
Recently, the actor revealed that the best thing that happened to him from Game of Thrones was his meeting his wife Rose.
"I found my soul mate through the show, so I believe the show gave me my future family and my life has moved on from there", he said.
Rose plays Yegret, who is the girlfriend of Jon Snow, the character of Kit in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married in Leslie, Scotland with family consent.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, there has been a 14% increase in new cases in China.
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in the country has increased by 14%.
Health officials have reported that more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In view of the recent changes, most of the new cases are being attributed to sex.
Traditionally, HIV has been spreading rapidly in parts of China due to infected blood infections.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials reported that the number of people infected with HIV through this medium had dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV infection from sex performed by China's LGBT community is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but the LGBT community is reportedly highly discriminated against.
Studies have estimated that because of the country's conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Because of the many infections of the disease, these relationships have inadequate protection from sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve the problem, promising everyone access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denied that her staff had leaked the GOP senator's data, calling it a "dangerous lie" and a "conspiracy method".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters called the allegations unfortunate, saying on Saturday that one of her employees had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on Lomaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were being investigated by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.
Waters tweeted, "Lies, lies and too much hate".
The information provided reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham and two Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information, seen online on Thursday and posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, came as a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was underway.
The leak of information about three senators had raised questions about Kavanaugh.
Hill says that conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState tracked IP addresses that identified the source of the person posting, saying the source was connected to Waters' office and that an employee of Waters had released the information.
Waters said, "This accusation is completely baseless, false and completely false".
"None of my employees - whose identity, personal information and security are being put at risk due to these false and false allegations - was in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This accusation is baseless, completely false and utterly false.
Waters soon posted online to clear criticism, including from the former White House press secretary.
"The reason for this rejection is anger", wrote Fletcher.
"It shows that his temperament is not what a Congressman should be.
When someone is accused, they should not do so in anger.
They should not become rebels.
They should not question the person who has made the accusation.
They should be calm and patient.
It appeared that Fletcher Waters' response was being compared to Judge Kavanaugh's condemnation of Democrats, who were accused by critics of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro also tweeted his thoughts on defeating Waters in the midterm election.
He tweeted, "If this is true, it is a big deal".
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement units to these claims of fraud.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are reported and that they are held legally accountable for all the things they have done that are very bad and dangerous for any and all of my employees", he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again review - Rowan Atkinson's performance as a detective was not considered very powerful
The importance of Brexit in any new film from a British perspective is still traditionally seen and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action-comedy spoof franchise that started with Johnny English in 2003 and was brought back in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
Shall we self - ironically say that we certainly consider it nonsense to talk about the nation 's new export opportunity?
At any rate, the unqualified Johnny English with the pop approach and rubber face has his license to recreate the basil-legged thing - which is far more famous than anything else by name alone - is a comprehensive comic creation for areas where non-English speakers live.
He is certainly the Daft Secret Agent who managed to show a bit of Mr. Bean's dash clown despite his bizarre disguise in smooth glamour and is a dolop for the chap who contributed the single note for the chariot of the Fire Theme tune at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is originally a traveller and the International Man of Mystery Atkinson whose role in the Barclays TV commercials was forgotten except for Chaos of the Wake.
This new JE outing has only one or two good scenes.
I loved Johnny English, which showed him in a medieval suit wearing armor, going into a helicopter and wrapping a rotor blade in his helmet.
Physical comedy on screen is a gift for Atkinson, but laughter is rare and the weird part feels half-finished, especially since "best" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible present themselves with confidence as a component of comedy.
Laughter comes as if comedy is not for adults but for children, and Johnny English's bizarre misunderstandings are completely intolerable to me and I like Bean better in Atkinson's silent film.
The always relevant thing right now is that Great Britain is in a serious crisis.
The most secretive network of British spies has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, the network that kept the identities of all the agents working in Britain to influence the agent's work - a tragic event for Kevin Alden.
This is the last resort for the brilliant and rather troubled Prime Minister, who is already struggling with a number of political and unpopularity problems: Emma Thompson can play this quasi-Teresa-me character well, but the script is not strong enough to work on this one.
His intelligence advisers told him that every working spy he had contracted with would have to bring someone who had retired.
This meant that Johnny English had to fight himself, who is now a schoolmaster at a posh institute, but had to work outside the record on what an undercover operative should look like: it has some good comedy, plus, the detective has to teach English at a rock-type academy school.
English is sent back to the Emergency Whitehall for briefing and Ben Miller's reprise is mixed with his much older betrayal-packed sidekick Boff.
Now married, Boff is trying to become a submarine commander, playing a jolie-hockey-sticks character with Vicky Pepperdine unable to get a grip.
So, Batman and Robin in Her Majesty's Secret Service get some very big mistakes when they face off against Olga Krulenko's beautiful and famous Ophelia Bulatova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is threatened by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to have the solution to Britain's computer crises: the sinner Jason Volta plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bog Fercial begin their odyssey of high-jinks: setting fire to a French restaurant while working as waiters; smuggling Volta's expensive boat; and English activates complete chaos when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to access the interior of Volta's house.
The film is obviously shot everywhere for that last sequence, but it's still neat and entertaining, with lots of fun stuff for kids throughout.
It 's a middle class, exactly.
Also, as I saw in other Johnny English films, in this film I was not sure if Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry that really suited his talent.
Labour has denied that it plans to work for the British people only four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a democratic plan that would require UK residents to work only four days a week - but get paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants the company owner to give a share of the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, so that they can get an extra day off.
This will give the employee three days off a week - but they will still be able to get the same pay.
Sources say such an idea will be 'in line' with the party 's economic agenda and is planned to benefit the country's workers.
The Trade Union Congress is promoting a four-day shift week to help workers take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight, but it is expected to take a four - day workweek, which is in line with the Party 's overall industrial strategy and the Party 's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers.'
Having been the Green Party's pledge to a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign, Labour would not be the first party to support such an idea.
However, this is not currently being fully supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day workweek is not the policy of the party and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get power back from 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' in utility firms.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get their full stake back as the Labour government can 'cut' based on alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed the plan to create an inclusive ownership fund to include employees on the boards of the company and to assign 10 per cent equity of private sector firms to employees who can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change his mind.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises questions about whether the bureau's findings helped a Republican senator withdraw his support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI was likely to find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared to be more candid than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I think so, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said that I spoke to Judge Kavanagh on the way to the hearing.
After that, when the allegation came out, I called them, asked, 'Did you do this?'
He was sure, determined, clear".
Graham's vote, however, seemed to be a stone's throw.
"I had made up my mind about Brett Cavanagh and that would have required an explosive charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it forcefully", Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whatever name he took, he could not verify it.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert featuring many highly influential stars, and an equally influential mission; to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will draw tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the program's true goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get free tickets to the event (unless you're willing to pay for VIP tickets), concertgoers must volunteer to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty, complete a number of "actions" such as emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or in other meaningful ways.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in the last 12 years in achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts the right way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clectivism" - people feeling like they're really making a difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, advancing efforts for various goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or fund-raising.
The group estimates that the safe fund has so far directly impacted around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K.-based partnership of investors and implementers who pledged to provide $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens pledging to "help children develop to their full potential".
During a live concert in London in April 2018, the Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracy Ullman told the crowd, "With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history".
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to a frequently asked question on their website, "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monai are among a handful of performers to perform at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Debra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy for "blockade" to hamper Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Citing the Washington Examiner, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington could use the US Navy "if necessary" to block Russian energy in US markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia's work in Syria - especially, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
He reportedly said, "I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to broker energy, as they have done in southern Europe, eastern Europe.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to ensure with our Navy that sea lanes remain open, and, if necessary, blockade, to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event organized by the Consumers Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are effectively the same.
Referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy, he said, "In the case of Iran and Russia, the economic option is, more or less, to take advantage of the fuel and replace it".
Statements are coming in that the Trump administration, replacing Russia, is on a mission to promote its LNG exports to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "hostage" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers".
The US stance was opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a big state interferes in our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusetts said Elizabeth Warren would "seriously consider" joining the 2020 presidential race.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday she would "seriously consider" the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
According to The Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and join our broken government and that includes having a woman in the top job".
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren, assessing President Donald Trump during the town hall, said, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren, Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have been vocal in their criticism of the president.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need to get an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents do not think he should contest the 2020 election.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, ninety-eight percent of "potential" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty - two per cent supported contesting the election in this way.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting a possible run and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names rumored to be potentially running by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin, at a rally for Donald Trump, cites Palin's PTSD
Track Paulin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in a domestic violence incident.
"I sympathize with other families who feel the impact of PTSD and know the wounds our soldiers come back with because of what my own son is going through", she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other retired soldiers, "They come back with little change, they come back tough, they come back wondering if this honor is for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the military, have sacrificed for the country".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence and drug possession of a weapon, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang-related escapes or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a Justice-Friendly abstract in Washington on Friday to support a refugee who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the August lawsuit against federal policy by the American Civil Liberties Union, Grace v. Sessions, has not been disclosed.
She said she was abused by her partner "and his violent gang member sons", but U.S. authorities denied her request for asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Government lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence, which generate large numbers of applicants for U.S. refugees.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed unorganized immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be judged on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a barrier violates that principle", said Justice Friend.
The attorney further argued in the brief that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply needed labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
In its June 11 policy announcement, Sessions said, "Asylum is available to people who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group".
Refuge was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
The rescue effort in Palu was fierce as the number of deaths in the search for survivors doubled.
For the survivors, the situation was extremely serious.
"It feels extremely stressful", said Reesa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting a feverish child at an evacuation centre in Tahs-e-Nahs Paloh city.
"Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their deserted homes, picking up submerged items, trying to save whatever they could find.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake injured hundreds and submerged hospitals.
Some of the injured, including Dwyane Harris, who were facing broken back and shoulders, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outdoors in the open due to the continuous strong tremors.
Tears filled his eyes as he felt the tremors of the violent earthquake in his fifth floor hotel room shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn 't have time to save ourselves.
I feel like I was trapped in the rubble of the wall", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after a four-page advert was run by the state-run Chinese newspaper in an American daily, citing the mutual benefits of US-Chinese trade, China's US ambassador accused Beijing of using the US press to propagate.
US President Donald Trump referred to the paid supplement of China Daily in Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, last Wednesday - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election was a new phase in Washington's campaign to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a growing trade war that has seen them round out imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and US experts say China's retaliatory tariffs earlier in the trade war were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad, writing in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, said China was "now doubling that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own independent press".
"In its propaganda, by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is leveraging America's cherished tradition of free speech and independent journalism", Branstad wrote.
"Given that the media is locked in the strong fist of the Chinese Communist Party, on the contrary, on the roadside newsstands here in Beijing, you will find limited voices of dissent and no accurate reflection of the conflicting opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's worrying economic curve", he wrote.
"One of China's most prominent newspapers avoided making excuses to publish his article", he said, though he did not name the newspaper.
With Kavanaugh's defeat, Republicans are isolating women voters ahead of the midterm elections, analysts warn.
As top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual harassment allegations, the analyst has warned they will see a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment around it is quite overwhelming, and most Republicans are already showing on record that they want to move forward with the vote.
There is no going back on those things", Grant Rieher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Rehr said he doubted that last-minute pressure by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women cannot forget what happened yesterday - neither in the coming tomorrow nor in November", said Carine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, as Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee sought to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters in the Senate lobby chanted "November is coming!", Meek reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to fall off the charts", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpolitical analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying it's already awesome; it's true.
But it could be more, especially among women voters in the suburbs and young voters aged 18 to 29, who often don't vote when they don't like the president".
Detailing the allegations of sexual harassment by Ford against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had said before the public testimony that it was likely to be met with opposition if Republicans move forward with the confirmation.
"It's become a confusing mess for the GOP", said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or putting Kavanaugh on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated them", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, an organization that helps Democrats win elections, reminded the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided on who to believe in light of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, most of whom appeared to favor Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or potentially believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or potentially believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanagh may or may not have lied during his testimony, compared with only 30 percent who said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as, at least, another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh beat him when he was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee displayed his genitals when he attended a party while studying at Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology Legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who will be allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is to achieve "world dominance".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
This may include contact lists, to - do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and business tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data stores is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to the company so that Solid can be made available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that she and her team "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a complete transformation, where all their business models will completely disappear overnight.
"We are not asking them for permission".
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vaughn: WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric was celebrated
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was celebrated in his home town for 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vaughan won the award in the attack at Bellinglyze and Lehighcourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his ships at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughn, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan led his battalion into the Canal de Saint-Quentin "among a very dense fog, under heavy shelling and machine guns on the battlefield".
He then moved to the firing line and, with "great valour", led the line and routed three units before taking up the field - gun alone.
Lieutenant Colonel Vaughn was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vaughn, 72, said that his grandfather's exploits were "something I know I can never match, but we admire".
He and his brother Dr. James Vaughn also laid wreaths after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughn said he was "very honoured to play a role in the parade" and added that "the support being given by so many is demonstrating the heroism of a true hero".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you stayed up all night watching the hectic Bellator 206, but missed the main programme.
The San Jose Bill had 13 contests, including six on the main card and was shown live all night on UK Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gagarde Moussaci and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned by the transformation of coverage into Peppa Pig.
Some were especially disappointed after staying up late for the morning competition.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator, said, "This content was not appropriate for 6am as per government regulation, so they had to switch to children's programming".
"Peppa the Pig", yes.
Scott Coker, president of the Bellator Company, said they were going to work on their scheduling to engage UK audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we might be able to find a solution", Coker said.
"But there will be six o'clock Sunday morning and we won't be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, Monday their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when this change happened, there were a lot of texts coming in and not all of them were responsive.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We're going to limit it to five matches instead of six, as we normally do, and when we tried to deliver something more to the fans, it just got a little too much.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley feels 'empty' when it comes to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he was driven to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but it inspired him to succeed.
Daily, 24, said he didn't realize until he reached secondary school that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc presented by Lauren LaVerne, she said she speaks about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that when he became a father, he was less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
On appearing on Laverne's first program as a socially-abused person, Daley said she felt "less than" herself compared to everyone else because "liking boys and girls was not socially acceptable".
She said: "Even today, those feelings of inferiority, and feeling different, are the real things that have given me strength and strength to be able to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "special", too, she said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile LGBT publicist and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live freely without any problems and he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said she was "surprised" when she fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her, but she said age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find a peer who went through the same ups and downs at such a young age.
In June the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "entire outlook" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about 'I need to win the gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there are many things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son's name is the same as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said his father did not accept that he was going to die and the last thing he wanted to know was if he had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
He said, "I couldn't tell them you wouldn't be sitting in the front row, Dad".
He said, "When they couldn't breathe, I held their hand and held them until they stopped breathing and they were dead, and then I went and I thought they weren't invincible".
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of the home crowd at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling", she said.
It also inspired his first favourite song - Pride by Heather Small - which echoed with him during the Olympic preparations and which still makes his ears tingle.
Desert Island Disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-form Mickelson out of the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his form to prevent it from becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, Mickelson was sidelined by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's foursomes and foursomes.
Rather than being the center of attention, as he often remains for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day sitting among cheering fans and working on improving the weaknesses of his playing style.
Never driving straight even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old was not an ideal fit for the Tite Le Golf National Course, where long-term inactive drivers are regularly punished for poor shots.
And where the course is not so easy, in Sunday's ninth match, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the American, who started 12 singles matches four points down, starts strong, Mickelson's match could prove to be quite important.
Furyk trusted his man, not that he could say anything else.
"They fully understood their role, patted my back and surrounded me in their arms and said they would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He is very confident in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn 't imagine him playing two matches.
I had more imagination, but it worked out the way we thought we should go.
He wants to go out there just like everyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This Ryder Cup could mark the end of a career that has never reached the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brings some intimacy to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's responsive, he likes to make people laugh, and his presence in the team room is special", he explained.
"I think the young players also enjoyed going to them this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives more than just play".
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big lead could soon be gone.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a big lead in the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an awkward move.
Dan made his first appearance in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros had gained a five-point lead over the Americans, but had just reached the finish line, with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory, by the lowest margin.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in the Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in the Valderrama, we just won", Byrne said, thinking to himself after watching the 2018 class lead Friday 5-3 and yesterday's lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and all the people on that team that it's not over.
You will pay the full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It 's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win this trophy and that's where we have to keep our focus.
I've always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware that the greatest players in the world - are on the other side".
Bjorn went on to say about how his players performed on the tough golf course: "I'll never outdo myself in that.
Tomorrow is a different hard time.
Tomorrow, individual demonstrations will come forward, and that's a different matter.
It's great to go out there with a partner when everything's going well, but when you go out there in person, your ability as a golfer is put to the test.
This is the message you need to convey to the players to show their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and give his best too".
Unlike Bjorn, opposing Jim Furyk would have been yearning for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exceptions being Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
As part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Furyck himself has been on both ends of that great final-day reversal before facing defeat by Europe's "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every word he said", he said when asked how captain Ben Crenshaw handled his players on his final day in 1999.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start the same way you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When this speed is one-way, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We set up our line-up to our own specifications and we got people involved in a way that we felt like, you know, we're trying to do some more miracles tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counterattack with Rory McClureau in the top match, where Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other top half of the European order.
"I grouped them in this order because I think it covers them all", Björn said of her solo selections.
The new German battleship is delayed again
The new German Navy warships were supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the time-wasting Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and rapidly rising costs, that won't happen until at least next year, local media reported.
According to a military spokesman quoted by the Die Zeit newspaper, the commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class warships, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling issues after delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg class ships were ordered by the Navy back in 2007 to replace the ageing Bremen-class battleships.
It is understood that they will feature an array of powerful artillery, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technology such as low radar, infrared and acoustic divisions.
Other important features include long maintenance period - it is possible to deploy the latest warships from domestic ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships - which could give Germany a chance to power projects abroad - will be obsolete by the time they enter service, Dai Zhen commented.
The ill-fated F125 warship made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Few people knew about the reasons for the withdrawal, but German media cited several significant "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship useless when deployed on war missions.
The software flaws were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - only half the manpower of the older Bremen-class warships.
Furthermore, it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 ton "Rhineland-Pfalz" is considered twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problem of new warships, which has become particularly important in the light of recent warnings, is straining Germany 's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was actually "running out of deployable ships".
The official said that over time the issue has become more acute as older vessels were taken out of service but no replacement vessels were made available.
He said none of the Baden-Württemberg-class warships were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is secretly listening in on the secret lives of bats.
New research being conducted at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the natural landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano pipistrels as well as the long-eared brown Dobbenton bats, which live in Inverway Gardens, Weston Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the property to track the movements of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings reveals the frequency of bat calls and what species are doing.
Then a map and report of the natural habitat will be prepared to illustrate their behavior on a detailed scenario scale.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of natural-habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of natural habitat management actions such as creating grasslands and how to maintain woodlands well for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the UK, the bat population has declined dramatically over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect bird nests and damage natural habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting systems can also pose a risk, as some chemical treatments of flypaper and building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats, can also pose a threat.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to their hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technology to identify faults and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly survey, inspect bird nests and occasionally rescue them.
The organisation has established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Thrive Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says the estate is the best place for him.
"Here in Thrive we have a great area for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees and all good natural habitats.
But there's still a lot that's unknown about bats, so the work we're doing here and in other properties will help us understand what they need to thrive".
They stress the importance of bat screening before maintenance is undertaken within properties as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a maternity maternity base could destroy 400 females and infants, possibly wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass them or destroy their nesting sites.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come forward to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and we still don't know how their populations are increasing for many of our species".
Ronaldo denied the rape claims while lawyers sued the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape claims against him "fake news" and said people are using his name to "promote themselves".
His lawyers are due to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Deray Spiegel reported on Friday that he allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video after reporting the claims, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no. I was just going to say,
What he said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to use my name to promote themselves.
This is normal.
They want to be popular with my name, but it is part of their job.
I am a happy person and everything is fine", the player said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations, according to Reuters, which he called "suspiciously invalid reporting in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the players would seek "compensation for moral damages in an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to papers filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good person" who was disappointed by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "scared of retaliation" and was worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to end the agreement as her harassment has continued since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and signed a €100 million deal with Italian giants Juve this summer.
Brexit: UK 'will regret for ever' losing car manufacturer
Trade Secretary Greg Clark said the U.K. would "regret forever" if it lost its position as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Barnstone near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that a border delay could affect jobs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Barnstone plant - which makes Toyota's Oris and Avenices - produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"I believe if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Barnstone.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
According to carmakers, the main concerns are related to supply chain risk in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with made-to-order car parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruption at the border, according to the industry, which could cause delays and shortages of parts.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be halted.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's Checks Plan for future relations with the EU was "purely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that I think not only delivers the success we currently enjoy, but also the one that is necessary to achieve this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"There is evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers that we should be able to fully continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains".
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but in the long run, warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lead to jobs being lost.
Peter Sauvallaris, who has worked at Barnstone for 24 years and is the coordinator of the Unite union at the plant, said its members are extremely concerned: "In my experience once these jobs are gone, they never come back in the long run.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again.
The White House said on Sunday that a high-stakes meeting with Donald Trump's deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "for another week" as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues his struggle.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and the news that Mueller's freedom is at stake, has heated the Washington rumor market for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wiretapping to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House amidst the news that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to remove Rosenstein but then delayed the meeting to avoid a clash with that Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I can see that in view of all the other cases going on with the Supreme Court the view can be pushed forward another week.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated".
Some journalists have claimed that: Sanders has not given a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to a lack of interest in the "gloriousness" of TV reporters, although he added: "I don't disagree with the fact that they are magnificent".
He then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
"Presidents have more Q&A sessions than any other president", he said, without citing evidence, adding: "We've seen those numbers".
The briefing will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States a direct question, it's better than talking to me".
We try very hard to do that and you've seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the president of the United States he's going to replace the press conference".
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the president's unmistakable and sometimes unique presence in front of the press in New York this week demonstrated why.
Health Secretary NHS writes to EU workers in Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them well after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK 's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to covering the cost of settlement status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the UK and EU continued to engage in dialogue, leading to the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also moving ahead with its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that this must have been a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from the EU, and beyond, bring together valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare delivery, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay".
Emergency surgery for Christian Abercrombie after a head injury
Tennessee Mike Organ reports that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who suffered a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the shore and just fell there", said Reed.
Instructors and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Aberdrombie has come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
"No details on the type/range of injury are available yet", Harris said, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before being out of the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
High stamp duty will be charged to foreign buyers when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, which will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory schemes.
This move would undermine the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract younger voters.
Increased stamp duty will be imposed on people who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury hopes it will raise up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are set to be charged higher stamp duty rates on property purchases in the UK - the extra cash to be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract younger voters with a promise to provide more affordable housing and target higher earners.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on individuals and firms not paying taxes in the UK, with the additional funds to boost the government's campaign to deal with sleeping rough.
Surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which includes two houses started two years ago and rental purchases, can be up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first time buyers to get their foot on the housing ladder.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people build their first homes.
He accused big construction firms of driving up property prices by grabbing land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to leave quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing shortage".
Mr. Corbyn has announced a lucrative series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give more power to councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our fragmented housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not true that it is as easy for individuals not living in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy a home for hardworking British residents.
For many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant thing, and the craze for sleeping in odd circumstances is extremely real".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scott is repeating the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who are currently third in League One, and who are three points clear of the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland with my father in Hampden from a young age, and it's always been something that draws me back.
This opportunity will come only when I succeed in managing the club. "
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager have included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Aloha Athletic boss says he felt no nerves about following such established names at such a big club that had previously rejected the initiatives of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success right now can be measured by whether I can get this club back to the Premier League".
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly comes in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy job to get it there, but I might see myself as a success here if I can get the club there".
After spending 15 months as assistant boss of Dumbarton and on the coaching staff of Hearts, Ross's managerial career has been just three years old.
He then helped Eloah recover from relegation to the third tier, and replaced St Mirren on the verge of relegation to the Championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
In the matter of taking over Aloa, he said, "This was probably the real crossroads".
"I really believed that management was more a fit for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did a decent job, earned a decent salary, and enjoyed some reasonable heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to get a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I still pass them in terms of job stress and pressure but everything seems fine in terms of management.
I always wanted to manage and now that I'm doing it, it makes me feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life".

The right time for a pint is Saturday at 5.30pm, the survey found.
The summer heat has boosted Britain's struggling pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The pub and bar group saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but restaurant volatility was down 4.8 percent, the data showed.
Peter Martin, business consultancy CGA, which compiles the data, said: "Continuing sunshine and expected participation in England's World Cup means July followed a similar pattern to last June, when pubs were up 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants struggled even more.
The decline in restaurant business in June of 1.8 per cent worsened in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol performed the strongest with more likes than restaurants.
Food - powered pubs also suffered in the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
Drinks sales in all pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food sales fell by three per cent.'
Paul Newman, Leisure and Hospitality Analyst RSM said: "These results have continued the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The influence of weather and major social or sporting events make the biggest factor for sales in outdoor market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continued to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales, especially under ongoing cost pressures, would be painful.
The long summer could not have been a worse time for food traders and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much needed relief".
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings in July, was 2.7 per cent, reflecting a slowdown in brand roll-out.
Coffer Peach Tracker monitors industry sales for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses data from 47 operating groups performing with a combined turnover of £9 billion, and is an established industry benchmark.

A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "fake Insta" pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children - some of them younger than 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a sharp rise in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they operate a clean "main" account to show their parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly visited her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found that a teenager was urging others to "rape me".
Research by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which were accepted for private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It is very disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Elidhe Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Board.
Elidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Governing Body's Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from their extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Elyth has a great respect for the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from having him on board", Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to serving as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland".
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, the American who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and who is now a regular BBC pundit, became unable to walk after a momentary ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke today a month ago.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was a daunting task, but I learned to fully recover, walk again, and practice agility today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Comparisons of mothers to cows by breast pump advertisements caused a split in online opinion.
A breast pump company split online opinion with an ad that compared breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product called "the world's first silent wearable breast bump", consumer tech company Elvie released a new funny music video-inspired ad, in which the new pump gives mothers the freedom to express themselves.
In a grass-covered cow barn, four real mothers dance to a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tails" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't thins, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes on: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies".
In any case, the ad, which was published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it lightly portrays the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They need to give birth to get pregnant and produce milk just like us, except that their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth", one wrote.
Elvie breast pump fits neatly inside the nursing bra
Another comment: "Obviously painful for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to keep their babies?"
Another added: "What an irrelevant advertisement".
Others defended the ad, with one woman saying she found the ad's song "ridiculous".
"I think this is a great idea.
I would have had this too, if I had been still breastfeeding.
Pumping makes me feel like a cow.
This ad is a little weird, but I saw it as it is.
One wrote that it is a great product".
Another commented: "It's a fun ad for mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and feel like 'cows.'
This is not a promotional or decisive advertisement for the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they were dancing with their bras carefully pumped.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like a cow.
However, the Elvy pump is well hidden, has no wires or tubes and fits neatly directly into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies and even go outside without pumping.
Ana Balerin, Partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The LV pump is a revolutionary product, which deserves a blast and a great launch.
By drawing parallels between women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges into the spotlight, demonstrating the sense of freedom that the new pump will bring in an entertaining and relevant way.
This is not the first time that the Elvi pump has been in the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two who used the product was seen catwalking for designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children sneaked into a tent camp on the Texas border.
The captured migrant children were spied on even when there was relatively no change in monthly border crossings, in part because the strict curbs and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hire children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors had hired undocumented migrants themselves and feared they would jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by going ahead and claiming any children.
The threat was further heightened in June, when federal rights announced that potential sponsors and other adults or older members of the household would have to give their fingerprints and the data would then be shared with immigration officials.
Last week, Matthew Elbens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, presented evidence to Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of the individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors' household are living in the country illegally and most of them are criminals.
So we continue to search for those individuals", Mr. Albanes said.
Demanding the children be prepared quickly, the authorities introduced new rules requiring children to appear in court within a month of being caught instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to asylum seekers.
Many people appear via video conference call rather than appearing in person to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit to be released are immediately expelled.
The longer children remain confined, the more likely they are to be restless or depressed, which can be quantified in violent impulses or escape attempts, according to conservation workers and system reports in recent months.
Lawyers or advocates said those cases are taken to a high-end facility like Tornillo, where the signs that the child is struggling are ignored because of their size.
He also said taking the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to get emotionally prepared or saying goodbye to friends will only add to the shock they are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even as the war in the country was now in its eighth year.
Maulom, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said foreign military forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw from the war zone immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Maulom stressed that "the war in Syria is almost over" where more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have been uprooted from their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this "supernatural war until we both clear all Syrian territories of all terrorist groups and the "presence of any foreigners".
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, primarily training and advising both the Kurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on the ground in the war - ravaged country.
On the issue of refugees, Mawlum said conditions were good for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading fear of unemployment", which led refugees to stay away.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return", he said.
"They were politicizing a purely humanitarian cause".
The United States and the European Union warned that no assistance would be given to Syria's reconstruction unless a political agreement was reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
A recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, provides an opportunity to further pressure political dialogue, say US politicians.
The Russian-Turkish deal or agreement averted a massive offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, which was home to three million people.
However, Mawlum said the agreement had a "clear timeline" and also expressed hope that the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda affiliated with the Nusra Front, who would be "eradicated".
US Representative Staffan Di Mistura hopes to soon hold the first meeting of a new committee with members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution to fix Syria and the course of the election.
Mawlum placed conditions on the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By that logic, Mr. Trump will win reelection in 2020, unless many liberals or elites are expecting some impeachment and scandal to end his term prematurely.
"This will be the most dramatic end to the National Post ever!"
So far, there was no fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings on CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and on MSNBC have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has averaged 2.4 million prime-time viewers over the past four years, with more than 1.7 million, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Meadows Show" topped the cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers with the top newscasts airing at night.
Neil Bair, director of "Designated Survivor", an ABC drama about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after being destroyed in an attack on the US Capitol, said, "It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we don't understand".
Neil Scovel, a veteran comedy writer and creator of "Just the Funny Parts: And Hollywood Boys " has a different theory of some of the harsh truths hidden in the "club".
She recalls a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because they make me laugh,' " Ms. Scovell told me.
There was a value in entertainment in the mess.
Of course, beyond the things on TV, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the unification of immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
Only a privileged audience could afford to miss it.
And yet, it's beyond being an informed citizen, when you find yourself watching a six-hour debate by a panel of experts, using Woodward's "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", the underlying reasoning behind Paul Manafort's $15,000 bomber jacket ("A thick cloth with a hood", the Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's detailed description of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'll never see Super Mario like that again.
Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pon Stars" producer Brent Montgomery said "as part of everything he does, which makes it exactly like a reality show where he brings you something new every night", which is about Trump's show's rotating cast and the plot twists of the day (selecting a fight from the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un's praise).
You can 't risk missing a single episode or you 'll be left behind.
When I went to see Mr. Flis this week, it was a hot 80 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.

"I remember when we were doing all those silly or provocative shows in those days and people said 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' " Mr. Flash told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but later I found out they were right".

The strong middle ground in the House race was flooded with outside money.
It was no surprise that Pennsylvania was flooded with cash in the 17th, which was credited with rebuilding the congressional district, which saw two incumbents run for the same seat.
That recently opened the front for Rep. Connor Lamb, a Democrat from the suburban Pittsburgh district - who won his seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamp was also involved in a run for a second term, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps with the new 17th.
Following the January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that old districts were unconstitutionally biased in favor of Republicans, the map was redrawn.
The empty hand battle between the major finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) in the new 17th race had touched the campaign economy.
Lamb's name became quite popular in Pennsylvania after a narrowly - seen win in a March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That is why the seat was held by Republicans for almost a decade and President Donald Trump won that district by 20 points.
The political pundits provoked the democrats a little more.
The US punishes El Salvador for supporting China, then retreats
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing due to resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had an impassioned meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization management team fired partners.
State Department officials decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore", Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only El Salvador was fined, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial aid.
The proposed sanctions, which included cutting financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When internal meetings or meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference, focusing on security and economic prosperity, to follow that mobilization or mass, similar to last year, seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent immigrants from leaving the United Nations.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead and effectively end, considering any sanctions or fines for El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of importing administrative space at the conference.
And the three Americans quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate or debate described by three US officials, including two politicians who agree to discuss the internal consultation on condition of anonymity.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and also speaks on condition of anonymity.
history of study
The next case could be the report of the Special Counsel Robert Mueller on potential resistance to Mr. Trump's justice, of which there is now ample evidence in the public record.
At the same time, Mr. Mueller reportedly changes the direction of his investigation into whether Mr. Trump 's campaign is colluding with Russia to invade our elections.
When Congress shakes hands, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable to that body as he prepares to go before voters again and perhaps a jury of his peers.
That is, a lot of ifs and don'ts, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump or his counterparts in Europe is not inevitable.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to make a move against Hitler, only if he was opposed by the West and supported by Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and as a result we missed the opportunity to prevent so many years of genocide.
The functioning of historical focal points and the uncomfortable march of democracy around such points of division are accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these divisive points.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenthin, the man who controls the final outcome of Mr. Mueller's investigation, what will we do?
Rosenthin has been in this dilemma ever since this paper reported on it last year, suggesting that the president be kept secretly on record and considered unfit for office.
Mr. Rosentine said that The Times account is not accurate.
"If the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he persists in the Supreme Court despite substantial allegations of sexual abuse and perjury, how will we respond?"
And above all, will we vote midterm for Congress, for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail in those tests, democracy will survive a long winter.
But I think the lesson I learned in Prague is that we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my embassy.
She survived and moved to the United States, and 60 years later, they sent me to light the Sabbath candles on a swastika table.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about my future?"

Graham Doran 's Rangers are optimistic after a fierce Vienna encounter
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, a win over the Austrians would put them in a strong position to qualify for Europa League Group G.
The knee injury prevents midfielder Graham Doran from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good thing for us because the Villarreal were good", the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could achieve something and reach a conclusion.
Maybe we can get it in the end, but overall, the draw will probably be a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first period and we came out even better in the second period.
Moving on to Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they got good results in their last game with the crowd or crowd behind us, I am sure we will play well and get positive results.
The last year was certainly difficult with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes made at the club itself but now it's a good experience at this venue.
The squad is good and the boys are really enjoying it; they have got good training.
Hopefully, we can now move on from our last season and be successful".
Women are losing their sleep for fear of this retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants were clearly aware of the type of care they needed, few were talking about it with their family members.
Almost half of people across the country said they were talking to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to look after them or take care of them, but they don't take any steps to negotiate", said Holly Cinder, vice president of life insurance business nationwide.
Here 's where to start.
Talk to your mate and children: You will not be able to prepare your family to care for you if you do not tell them in advance what you want.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how to get care, as those options can be important factors in determining costs.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also give you suggestions on how to pay for those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy, to help pay for these expenses or to insure your own health, as long as you have the money.
Present your legal documents: Make your legal battle easier.
Get a healthcare proxy, so you can appoint someone you trust to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate or negotiate.
Also, consider the power of attorney to inspect your finances.
You will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are rushed to the hospital.
So can you answer their questions about medication and allergies?
Write that information down in a plan so that you are prepared.
"It is not only the financial role, but who is the doctor?" asked Martin.
"What medications are given?
Who will take care of the dog?
Is there a plan?"
A man fired several rounds in the air in Lafracoob
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he was walking home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Lafracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials describe the shooting at around 02:30 BST as a "coincidental incident".
The victim could not see his attacker.
His wounds were not so deep that the police called on him to testify.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise further.
With communication cut off, rescue officials were unable to get any information from the Donggala Regency, the northern region of Palu, which is near the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people trapped in the disaster were evacuated.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongola, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017, located on the shore of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongola is a regency on the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island, extending over an area of over 300 kilometres (180 mi).
The Regency below the administrative province has an estimated population of 299, up from 200 in 2017.
The main basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also very important in the province, but it is concentrated in Morowali on the opposite shores of Maxima Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, tsunamis have struck in Palu and Dongola several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Dongola killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit western Dongola, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire seismically and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Ake Province in North Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, half of whom were in Ake.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes also hit the western coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude tsunami triggered a tsunami in Indonesia's most populous island, Java, which struck the southern coast and killed about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake near the town of Padang hit the area which is the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Mentawai Island off the coast of Sumatra hit the region, causing a tsunami in an area of up to 10 meters to devastate dozens of villages and kill about 300 people.
2016: A seawater earthquake in AK hit the Pidi Jaya Regency, causing destruction and disruption as it reminded people of the devastation or devastation of the 2004 devastating earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by building or buildings collapsing.
2018: Strong earthquakes devastated everything on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists helpless for a time.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of East Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, tampering with domestic violence reports and resisting arrest, according to a report released by the state of Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, he would take the call from her.
According to KTUU reports, Palin was sent back to the Maut-Su pretrial facility and also fined $500 unsecured bond.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when asked for an argument, the network report said.
Palin faced three Class A felonies, where he could be sentenced to up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged under a Class B offense with a sentence of one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Court of Veteran Persons.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
In the days ahead, the mortality rate was rising and electricity and communication networks were not working.
The earthquake struck in Central Sulawesi, a region northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos showing the impact were circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, thousands of people had gathered in the town of Palu for the beach festival.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for the NYC attack suspect.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a rare death sentence for Safuolo Sipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack on New York City that killed eight people -- a rare sentence given in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Sipov, 30, allegedly uses a Home Depot rental truck to bike assault on a highway road on the west side of lower Manhattan in October, cutting pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York, to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Sipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" physically injured them".
Both countries potentially impose the death penalty, according to court documents.
A week after the raid, a federal grand jury indicted Sipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for aiding and abetting racketeering, which are used by federal prosecutors specifically in organized crime cases and in cases of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the invasion required "adequate planning and prior consultation", explaining the manner in which Saipov carried it out in a "disgusting, cruel and vicious" manner.
"Safulau Habibullavich Sipov injured and harmed the friends and families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves Enlor Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Allerz, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Pagunco", the statement of intent said.
Five of the victims were tourists, who were from Argentina.
The trial of the last death penalty case in the Southern District of New York has been going on for a decade.
The accused Khalid Brain was found guilty of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death sentence was handed down in 1953 in a New York federal case for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Jonathon Rosenberg was executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a local resident of Uzbekistan, had no grief or remorse for days and months after the invasion, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators that he liked everything he did.
Saipov told authorities he was motivated to attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone of the crime.
Police said he also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He requested not to be guilty of the offence of count 22.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says he is "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We feel that our decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept life imprisonment without any possibility of release will only postpone the psychological trauma of these events to include everyone", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz vowed to 'gather an army of people' during the Tory conference protests.
The Eastern UKIP leader called on politicians from the Eurosceptics to 'understand the atmosphere' - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested they should negotiate with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told a march in Birmingham that if Mr Faraz had been Brexit Secretary, Britain would have been 'out' by now.
But the challenges faced by Mrs May in addressing her deeply divided ranks have been highlighted by the pro-Remain Tories to add a separate opposition to Brexit in the city.
The Premier is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted she would try to strike a deal with Brussels rather than backlash - and force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr Bone said leaving meant leaving the rally in Solihull, in which he wanted to 'throw the checkers'.
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should be made a partner and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was in charge, we would have been out by now,' she said.
The Wellingborough MP said: 'I will stand for Brexit but we need to get the checkers out.'
Setting its opposition in the EU, he said: 'We don't need to be subject to anyone to fight a world war.'
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Bone dismissed all suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and they want to stay is utterly false.'
Tory Brexitite Andrea Jenkins was also in March, saying: 'I'm just saying this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Checker is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so popular among our party and our workers who actually march in the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please drop the checkers and start listening.'
In a focused message to Mrs. May, he said: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they do not break their promise.
Mr. Faraz said the rally leaders should be 'realized' if they cheat with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'This is now a matter between us - the people and our political classes,' he said.
'They are trying to cheat Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not let you get away with it.'
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he said: 'I want you to make our political class understand the climate that is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
'We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has won us Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the remnants march from Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A gang of activists pointed to the Tories against the Brexit banner after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis pretends to be negotiating for security issues from the party app at the opening of the conference.
'These are the people who tell us that they can have the right IT system and all the technology for Canada, a borderless border and borderless free trade in Ireland.
'This is a complete swing.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to take a 'tough view' of the president's operations
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "keep a close eye on the president's operations" after the election in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat or Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
A regular critic of President Donald Trump, Warren GOP state icon Geoff DeHael is running for re-election in November, having co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There was speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was Trump's 36th meeting with voters using the Town Hall format since taking office.
One of the people asked if she was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to go and fix our broken government and include women first".
LSU Sim's death was a surprise.
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the murder of LSU basketball player Wade Sim on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11 a.m. ET news conference or conference.
He released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sim, 20, was shot dead near the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Police Chief Murphy G. Paul told Per 247 Sport on Saturday that 'Wade Sim died from a gunshot wound to the head.'
Wade stepped forward to defend his friend and was killed by Simpson.
When asked, Simpson admitted to killing Wade Sim with a gun there.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6 by 6 foot junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton ends world title after team victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment on it became clear that Valtteri Bottas was a great contender for a place in the Louis Hamilton Mercedes team order race on Saturday.
From the pole, Bottas made a good start and knocked out Hamilton as he made his place in the first two turns and invited Vettel to create a barrier in his team's drivers.
Wettle went into the pits first and left Hamilton in traffic behind the pack, something that should be decisive.
Mercedes was a lap behind and came out from behind Vettel but Hamilton took the lead after some wheel-to-wheel action which saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave free after a double-move while defending at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh when he reached the end of the first lap by his 21st birthday.
He then moved on to a larger part of the race when he focused on changing his tyre and quickly outscored Kimi Raccoon in fourth place.
He finally got into the pits on lap 44 but was unable to increase his pace on the remaining eight laps, when Rekonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valterie did a great job all weekend and is a truly great gentleman.
The team performed brilliantly, getting one - two, Hamilton said.
It was really a very bad gesture.
President Donald Trump on Saturday lied to Senator Dean Feinstein at his request that he had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the statement letter given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on the current state of the Senate, saying that people are "mean and bad and dishonest".
"One of the very good things or things that could happen in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean and bad and dishonest people", he said.
"When you look at the release and the leak and then they say, 'Hey, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it".
Do you remember?
Dean Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Hey, no. I'm not going to.
I did not leak".
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak, he said, pointing to the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations made by Ford against Kavanaugh back in July and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied it was leaked from the office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he said".
But the president did not find his rejection justified, commenting at a Saturday night rally: "I must tell you that these were really very bad moods.
Perhaps he didn't, but I've rarely seen such a bad gesture before".
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats were using the allegations on his behalf.
"They are determined to withdraw power by any means necessary.
You see their meanness, their dirty talk and also that they don't care who they hurt or who they run after to get power or power or control", the mediator reported the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giants won by a score of 3 - 1
Patrick Dewar scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars won the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday to make up for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants.
The Giants had a two-goal lead early through attacks from Patrick Doyer and Francis Beaulieu.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crowney took the home side level before re-establishing the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before the win was secured by two goals from Lucas Lundwald Nielsen.
It was the third Elite loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
With the Giants winning their last three matches, this was the fourth meeting of the season on the sides.
Dwyer's opener came at 3:35 in the fourth with the help of Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford helping Beaulieu double the lead in the final four minutes.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan performed his home run back at 13:10 before Matt Merquadret equalised with Cooney at 15:16.
Doyer ensures that the Giants build up the lead in the first period until he scores his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side regrouped and Boschard once again brought them to level period with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nelson give Dundee the lead for the first time in the second period of the match and he secured victory in the final period at his team's fifth halfway.
The Giants, who had lost their last five matches so far, are now scheduled to play their next match on Friday at their home ground Milton Keynes.
An air traffic controller was killed to ensure that hundreds of people could escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero or heroine since he was killed in ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people could land safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The aftershocks continued to devastate the area and many people were trapped under the rubble in the town of Palu.
But as his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonis Gunawan Egang refused to leave his busy post at the Mutiyaara Siss Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He was there to ensure that Batic Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could land safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to fall.
He later died in the hospital.
Johannes Sirret, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take them from another city to a larger hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost them before the helicopter reached the flank.
"We were heartbroken when he left", she said.
Meanwhile, officials fear the death toll could reach thousands with the devastation of the country, with the Alpine Agency saying access to Dongola, Sighi and Botnish is limited.
"The death rate may still be increasing as many bodies may still be buried in debris or rubble, or in many places that are inaccessible", said agency spokesman Sutopo Nugroho.
Waves up to six metres high devastated Palu, leading to a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Reesa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances were bringing bodies every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets were looted everywhere".
The head of the International Red Cross, Jane Galland, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running a race to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking you all to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation or evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
In Indonesia, the previous earthquake struck in Lubang earlier this year, killing about 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing since the Laguna plane crash
The airline operating the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Macronesia now says one man is missing after it was last reported that 47 passengers and crew or crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working closely with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline does not respond immediately to requests for unsolicited information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
When the plane plunged into the water while attempting to land at Fallujah Island Airport, local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all of them are now in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the manner of the incident is unclear.
The airline and the US Navy say both planes did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or eyewitnesses thought that the plane did not land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jane said the plane had come too low.
Jane said, "This is a very good thing".
Jane said she and others were pulled out of the deep water by an emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the crew of the plane was panicked and screaming and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve the pier also helped rescue by using a wind boat to bring people ashore in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water before the plane sank.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people were killed in crashes of PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades but none were involved in Air Niue.
Analyst said the time of night when the woman was burned alive
Prosecutors reinstated their case on Saturday to retry a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigative analysis.
She told the jury how she used cellphone records to piece together the activities of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she obtained location data from multiple cellphones, which showed that the deceased was with Tallis Chambers on the evening of the death, refuting her previous claims, The Clarion-Ledger reported.
While the data shows that when he said he was with his friend Michelle Sanford, his cell phone was near the chambers at the time, police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and presented evidence that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tallis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because his truck was in Nashville".
The second discrepancy was that Tallis said he knew Chambers from about two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tallis deleted all of Chambers' text or message, call or contact information from her phone.
"She erased him from her life", Hale said.
The defendants are set to begin their closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected to go to the jury for the trial that day.
High Breed: What is conscious or conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to change the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed from Bristol claimed that hip-hop has strayed from its roots to address political messages and social issues.
They wanted to get away from their roots and re-awaken popular hip-hop.
Artists like Fugees and Common saw a recent resurgence in Britain through artists like Alaka and Loki.
The other black guy?!
NY nanny sues couple after firing after "racist" text
A New York nanny sues a couple for biased shooting after a mother complains she is "the other black person" after sending a misleading text.
Couple denies they are racist, suing for "abduction".
Lynsey Placebo-Flexman, mother of two, expresses her displeasure to new baby-sitter Giselle Morris, who was black on her first day of work in 2016.
"No other black person", Mrs. Plasco Flaxman said in a text to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Ms. Morris.
According to a New York Post, after realizing his mistake, a "uncomfortable" Placebo-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, explaining that her outgoing nanny who was African-American had done a poor job and that he was expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris was sent home to Uber after paying for her day's work.
Now, Morris is demanding the couple be fired and compensated $350 a day for six months, at a live-in gig she was hired to start working on though without a contract.
"Look I want to show them that you do not do such a thing", he said, adding that "I know it is discrimination", he said in a post on Friday.
The couple responded to claims that they were racist, saying that they could not trust him after insulting him, it was right to terminate Morris' employment.
"My wife sent something that she didn't mean.
He is not a racist.
We are not racist people", husband Joe Plasco told the Post.
But would you hand over your children to someone you've ever insulted, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn?
Let it go".
Like the "abduction" case, Plasco said his wife had only had a baby for two months and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going after someone like that?
It 's not right to do that,' said the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the couple's accusations on social media, silencing them for their behavior and reasoning, have prompted a quick reaction.
Paddyston publishers fear readers won't associate it with their own thoughts and opinions, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was accepted, said in the letter: "It is difficult to imagine putting yourself in someone's shoes when you first read it before it was published.
It's amazing to know about the success of Paddington".
Speaking of her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a small bear toy, she was optimistic about the rejection of her work, saying that there was both "joy and sorrow" after her death on the 60th anniversary of the publication of her book.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "an important member of her family", she says her father was proud of her potential success.
"He was a quiet man and not at all arrogant", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to them, it was almost like you have a child who gets something: you're proud of them, even if you're not actually doing it.
I think that's how they saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his idea and creation, he always credited Paddington with it".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the work by doctors was in vain.
"Nad was regularly saying it was really bad, not what he expected", said Mrs Adenne-Lapros.
"Then Ned called me to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, son.
I will be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication doctors gave him to keep his heart beating was slowly leaving his system.
She would have died a long time ago and it would have been over.
I just had to go and sit there and wait, knowing that it was all going to end.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry, because I was surrounded by my family.
I had to handle everyone".
Mrs. Adnan-Lapros, who was saddened by the loss of her daughter, finally boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the situation they were going through.
"No-one knows", he said.
"I bowed my head and cried all the time.
It was hard to express, but I saw a feeling of extreme sympathy for Ned on the plane.
She needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her".
Postcards of women victims to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide want to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Callie Humphrey post cards and phone numbers on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages for people to call for help.
Mr. Davis' son was 13 years old when he suffered from depression and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mr Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef who spread his smile everywhere.
"Everyone knew her for her smile.
He always said that his smile could light up anywhere".
He had quit his job before he died and was living in a "very dark room".
In 2014, Tyler's brother who was 11 at the time was searching for his missing sibling, after which he committed suicide.
"I was constantly worried that there was going to be a cumulative effect", said Ms. Davis.
Ms. Davis made the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there you can go and talk to, even if it's not a friend.
Don't sit still - you need to talk".
Ms. Humphries, who has been a friend of Ms. Davis for years, lost her friend of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say anything that he was feeling sad or sad or anything else", she said.
"A few days before Christmas we will make some changes in her behaviour.
He was very sad on Christmas Day - he couldn't look at the children when they opened their presents".
She said her death was a big shock for her, but she had to get out of it: "It tore the family apart from the inside.
It made us sad.
But we all had to step up and fight".

When the FBI investigation began, Kavanaugh's future was in jeopardy.
"I thought, if I could really find something that he is looking for - a limited time and limited scope of investigation - maybe we could bring some unity", Mr Fleck said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "breaking up" amid alleged biased gridlock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance was due to time.
The midterm elections were only five weeks away, on November 6 - as expected, if Republicans perform so poorly, they would be severely weakened in their efforts to win the one they wanted on the high court on the ground.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call the senator, campaigns for him to support Mr. Kuangwa, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him meets his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI presented its report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is unclear whether Mr. Kuangwa could receive at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which Mike Pence, the vice president, had to endorse and confirm in the Supreme Court.
North Korean defectors 'fallen' by Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea fell when John-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean administrator said.
Citing the South's Unification Ministry, Park Byung-seog said 1,127 people fled their duty last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and smugglers were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The maximum number fled China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easy to cross the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats fugitives as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between the North and South - which are still technically at war - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks, which focused on the denuclearization talks.
It was activated after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they broadly agreed on terms for working towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yang-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in America, there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances, we will have no choice but to unilaterally harm ourselves first", Mr Rai said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "funny", saying he was not qualified for the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "funny" and said he was naturally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't imagine a woman would even perform like that, they call it 'funny,'" Pelosi said Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, responding to Cowan's testimony.
Kavanagh emotionally denied allegations that he had ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanagua was very emotional, sometimes screaming and holding his breath while talking about his family and his school years.
He punished Democrats on the committee for apparently falsifying allegations by liberals that he was a "weird and coordinated character assassin" who were angry about Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election loss.
Pelosi said she felt Kavanaugh's witnesses had proven he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed he was anti-Democrat.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements as well as the way he approached Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi questioned whether she would still blame Kavanaugh if asked if Kavanaugh becomes permanent and if Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit for the Supreme Court, but because he's been invited, he can work now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the potential rules in Cowanuga against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because they are known for conservative justice.
In his testimony, Kavanagh avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh deferred questions on whether he would reverse some Supreme Court decisions.
And women need to shake it up.
It's a religious offense, months and years of anger coming out and she can't stop herself from crying.
Ms. Stamin told me 45 years later, "When we cry, we get angry".
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who works for an officer somewhere, who said that she cries when she's angry, too, but she's developed a new technique, which means that when she's angry and she starts crying, she will say to the person she's talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you".
And then she kept talking.
And I thought it was great".
Tears are allowed to come out as part of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an early job, a male head office, is when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, finding an elderly woman holding my neck from behind - a vicious manager I had always been a little afraid of - who dragged me down the stairs.
He said, "Never cry in front of anyone".
"They don't know how angry you are.
They think you are sad and you will be happy to see them. "
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congressional woman from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and his name was withdrawn from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was extremely disappointed, decided to run for president herself.
"It was not a thoughtful decision", he told me after 30 years, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called her "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was delayed, she did not have time to raise funds and so she vowed that she would not run until she had raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who had given the men $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she could not contain her emotions - gratitude to those who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and even frustration with targeted voters rather than representatives and anger at sexism - she choked.
"You would have thought I would have a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press would have reacted to her.
"You might have thought that Clenx is my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they're going to put on my grave.
"She cried"?"
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial salvos of the trade war between the US and China were slowing down and while the war is far from over, the rifts between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts said.
US President Donald Trump said the first warning was issued earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week with new tariffs affecting items up to $200 billion (£150 billion) effectively tax more than half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in its own way each time, most recently slapping tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-by-shot and the world's second largest economy is likely to collapse soon.
Getting Washington back would mean hollowing out demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be very embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say Beijing could make its move, with the US trade war potentially supporting China in the long run while positively reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create situations that either trigger economic tailspin in the country, which is actually even more dangerous than previously seen by viewers", said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for a New America Security, a think tank.
Syria is 'ready' to take back Syrian refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria said it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appealed for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maulom said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to the progress made in countering terrorism", he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for voluntary return of refugees to the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mawlum said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he insisted that it would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries sponsoring the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The USA now face six consecutive defeats on European soil and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Danish captain Thomas Jørn's teen reaches the 14.5 points needed to beat the American, Europe regains its title.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled at the maximum tournament, showed his T-shot in the water on the par-3 16th hole by accepting a match from Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever reach a score of 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Speith was defeated 5-4 by Denmark's Thorbjørn Olesen, the lowest ranked player on the European team.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Donson, lost 2-1 to England's Lan Poulter, who had perhaps played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the only European to win the tournament every time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't help myself.
It was a difficult year.
So thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm very happy that I could help", Grazia said emotionally after the European victory.
He held the torch for his partner John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Wood 2-1 in single play on Sunday.
"I feel extremely proud to beat Tiger Wood, I grew up watching him", said Rahm, 23.
Wood lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
One of the greatest players of all time has won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nichols.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find a fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finney, who played golf with full caliber throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furke said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
In the morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We defeated them.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and move forward with Thomas.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
You should greet them.
We played better".
Red Tide Update: Concentration is low in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
News reports from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission show that there is a general decline in red tide concentrations for part of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, cases of passive bloom were reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - suggesting lower concentrations.
The Red Tide stretches for about 130 miles along the coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee County.
Patches can be found about 10 miles from Hillsborough County, but at fewer sites than last week.
Red Tide can also be seen in Pasco County.
Last week moderate concentrations were reported in or offshore of Pinellas County, minimum concentrations in Hillsborough County, background-high concentrations in Manatee County, background-high concentrations in offshore of Sarasota County, background-medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background-high concentrations in offshore of Lee County and background-low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory pneumonia outbreaks are continuously reported in Penellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No counties were reported with respiratory failure outbreaks in northwest Florida last week.
