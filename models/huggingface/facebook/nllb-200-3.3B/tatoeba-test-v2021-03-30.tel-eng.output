He 's our guy .
I'll start this very soon.
How are you coming?
Sin cried out.
What were you talking about?
Mary bought a new dress for the party.
Lalita called.
My father would fall asleep while looking at my binoculars.
He's not home anymore.
He has two pencils, one long and one short.
The elderly walk slowly
How beautiful the Taj Mahal is!
We haven't slept in days.
Ramadu came to the village.
He touched me.
He is not Rama.
Tom washed his hands thoroughly.
Woe to you!
Of course
Are you okay?
I recognized you as my brother.
Emmett, is this true?
When will Sita leave?
It's not that easy, you know.
What's in the box?
Is there good water?
This plant has some burnt leaves.
Emmett, is this true?
Located near the station
And he took his spectacles, and washed them with boiling water and soap, and put them on a cloth.
Will you be a mother before seven?
Did this really happen?
That boy was a little monster.
It was clear that there was no other way.
Sita is beautiful.
Did you do your homework?
Some dogs are still alive.
There are islands in the sea.
Have you eaten?
He's teaching Spanish to the kids.
How long does it take to get to the station?
Happy International Women's Day! The women of the world are here to help.
Where did you put my book?
She has been teaching music for thirty years
He made her a bookshelf.
Tom's words upset Mary.
There is no need to be afraid.
The day is not over yet.
The woman refused to say more.
We want to hear.
Are you still afraid of what might happen?
It really hurt me.
I should have been able to do it myself.
Can you tell me where the nearest bus stop is?
No one came.
What 's your room number ?
When will you come back?
As far as I know, he is not married yet.
We don't understand French.
Sin cried out loudly.
Have you ever been to Paris?
The couple had no children.
We have to get rid of him.
My bag is nowhere to be seen.
They sing a song
You seem very happy.
We should employ only trustworthy ones
Why didn't you prepare?
Show me where it hurts.
Give this book to Ram.
The baby cries for milk
I know you'll say no.
These pencils are the same color
I'll be very careful.
I ran home.
Did you do your homework?
That is a very stupid question.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
What color do you like, blue or pink?
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
She sat on the table.
Our sister is a tennis-playing crazy.
I don't believe him
I don't like coffee.
Shall we go out to eat tonight?
Rama has come.
What's the use of calling them that?
What did you talk about?
Are you okay?
Oh, my God!
Stay where you are.
Do you live around here?
What are you doing tomorrow, Tom?
We played basketball yesterday.
Give it to Ram.
Sita smiled at him.
I've never been to Japan.
They are animals.
How many mangoes do you want?
What time is it?
I don't know where they are.
He did.
Are you okay ?
Thank you for greeting me.
It is difficult to speak English well.
I'm really sorry about last night.
I wouldn't go there today if I were you.
We did it on purpose.
The king has fallen from the stairs!
These socks don't last when washed.
She's not a doctor.
Why aren't you asleep yet?
He dressed himself as a woman.
How did you put this doll?
The Bible says that "they will never see the land again".
The children love cake.
What the game is saying is meaningless
You came early.
Canola is delicious.
Let's take that chance.
Bring the tea.
How much is the book worth ?
Come, I'll give you some too.
I can't keep you here much longer.
You need to speak up.
I'll leave it this time.
I don't need anything.
How many mangoes do you want?
How tall is she?
I got it.
What will you take?
This was while I was eating bananas.
It's not a sentence.
Mary would have lied to you, but she didn't.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
She was startled.
It is not good for you to sit still all day.
Let him stay there.
Did you do your homework?
How are you?
What is your pen ?
What a miracle!
The cat trembled with fear .
The movie is about to start.
Is this real?
Why did you call me?
Is it pink?
When will my uncle come from Vijayawada?
You can.
People believe that God exists.
I made a mistake, even though I didn't mean to.
I'm learning the Burmese language.
You can eat your lunch in this room.
Do not hesitate to ask me for help.
It's time to leave for school, isn't it?
It's not all your fault.
I'm hungry again.
My father is not at home right now.
Ram came to the school.
Did Lata come?
I'm going to make mistakes.
Mary's boyfriend threatened to leave her.
It was a party.
Tom was very scared.
Did you do your homework?
My head hurts.
Where words cannot speak, music speaks.
Is the work done?
Emmett, is this true?
What time is it?
I don't know who won.
Out of sight, out of mind.
I thought it was useless
I'll get off at the next stop.
Is it really that bad?
I'm not allowed to do that here.
What time is it?
How's the stomach?
I started talking.
Mary bought a fake Gucci handbag.
He was on his way to school.
The evening meal is a cause for nausea
I'm not the only one to blame.
Do you know why he is so angry ?
It looks very interesting.
Is it Chinese or Japanese? Is it Korean?
It is better to leave him alone
The help came too late
That's it!
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Go there.
What are you saying?
Have you completed the work I have asked you to do?
Don't interfere with my work.
Two birds for one stone
This is a study.
Is there anything else you can say about that?
What is wrong?
She breathed in the cold air .
It is very valuable.
Did you do your homework yesterday?
What else could I lose ?
Are you angry?
You'll understand when you're mine
Not only a great game, but a great doctor.
Tell me about your daily life.
You can go swimming or fishing.
My computer is expensive.
Where is Mary?
He earns three times as much as I do.
I've never seen him.
Are you ready to do this?
Are you okay?
How are you?
Go there tomorrow!
I'm usually the one doing it.
Is Lata from school?
Why can't giraffes sing?
How peaceful this room is!
I know he will come.
It's not my fault.
The work is almost done.
I heard you were sick.
Why did you lie to her?
It's not that easy.
You are fat.
A cat came out from under the desk.
Bring tea immediately!
I don't have time to talk right now.
I don't speak Japanese.
Brush your teeth daily
When did you stop smoking?
The legs and arms of the hyaena are long.
It's the evening reading.
She asked me how many languages I spoke.
I'm too old to make my own decisions.
He has washed his hands of the blood that was on his hands .
You should come sometime.
Did you see it?
Have you ever had a heart attack?
We need money to do anything.
I do not accept
Who are we?
I heard the bell ring.
Can I make a phone call ?
Shabaash! The doll is good!
Where's your boy?
Only animal products contain fat.
Please give me some more coffee.
I suggest you do that.
It's the evening reading.
He did not keep his word
Is the red rose blooming ?
Have you done your homework?
She opened the door with her heart beating
Is that so ?
Lalita invited me to the wedding.
The whole afternoon or longer
He took revenge
Shabash, you have done a great job with this doll!
I drank coffee.
How are you?
