This not only proves the already widespread theory that at least certain dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
Scientists say the animal's disguise was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid undercoat.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but do have other feather features - such as tail feathers.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used to fly, but to regulate temperature or to look like it, and the researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this specimen actually shows adult feathers, and therefore not the sound of a chicken.
The researchers suggested that, despite the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen had the appearance of an adult rather than the sound of a chicken.

The work completed was mainly theoretical in nature, but the program was written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the galaxy.
Similar to the way the moon exerts force on earth, leading to tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the constellation Sagittarius.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy is in a circle of some kind, and it's made up of a large amount of smaller particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a little less technological: voters go into a cage and put a preprinted piece of paper in an envelope that says which candidate they vote for.
Officials first check the identity of the voter, then the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box and then puts his signature under the ballot.
The process is relatively tightly laid down in the French electoral law.
Since 1988, voting has to be transparent so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in the ballot at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process, and volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the eyewitness report may have been intended because her story has been published many times.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently and courts have labeled the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photos and other suspects".
Crown Office has overall control of prosecutions and has told reporters that no further statements will be made, at least until charges have been filed.
Sources say the document refers to a settlement of the dispute, something the Palestinians wanted to do because of the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both nations, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years after the signing of an agreement, but the PA is only willing to do so for five years.
The additional insect control test required close monitoring by forest rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park and heritage at NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation had extensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday Martelly swore an interim nine-member council (Provisional Electoral Council or CEP).
This is how Martelly has won five CEPs in the last four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the former National Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to bring new elections to the country.
The committee was set up by Martelly in response to widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of defective iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with mild burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called 'not serious'.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the Commission's comments on the comments on the Commission's comments on the comments on the Commission's comments on the comments on the Commission's comments on the comments on the Commission's comments on the comments on the Commission's comments on the comments on the comments on the Commission's comments on the comments on the opening decision.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07:19 local time (Friday 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Management Agency said no damage was reported nationwide.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Philippine police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six fatalities have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages were released earlier, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed his father's example and went into medicine.
Trained as a midwife, he joined the staff of the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins spent his free time researching premature birth.
His research showed that the maturation of fetal lungs in babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" of flight recorders on Wednesday.
Even fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna died on the night of two moons, as unique as she was, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even stranger... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed for the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Resigning Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed supported this view, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
29 percent of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and on the other end 31 percent said that should never happen.
The Olympic gold medalist swam the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and three relay events during the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was called into question due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the medications he needed to relieve his pain because they're banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number at the time on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water on Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into the way planets form, especially as comets have collided with the earth for a long time.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He called the gossip "political nonsense and gossip".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The nextGen system would allow aircraft to take shorter routes, according to the FAA, saving millions of tons of fuel annually for lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technologies, which allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and they can provide pilots with clearer information.
No additional transport is used and no overground trains stop at Wembley; in addition, parking spaces and the P&R are not accessible on the premises.
A possible lack of transportation increased the chances of the match being played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science looked at the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations, and it was thought that this process took much longer because crossing an indigenous Darwin's finch, the Middle Finch, with an immigrant Cactus finch, the Española finch, took longer.
Gold can be processed into many shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into a narrow wire that can be twisted and folded, or it can be forged or rolled into plates.
After it was made very thin, it could be glued to another metal, even being made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books that were called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance, and you're already making an indicator using red carbonate juice.
The colour of the carbonate juice then changes based on the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH value is given on the basis of the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix the two dry powders together, get your hands wet and clean, and make a ball of it.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of envelope.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every home had a sewer system connected to an advanced sewer system.
Sewer remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
In addition, there were toilets in ancient China, Egypt, and Persia, and in the Roman era, toilets were often part of a public bathroom, where both ladies and gentlemen met in a mixed group.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it will be immediately returned.
The satellite is being shot into space by a rocket, and scientists are using telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and image.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need to have a huge rocket that is over 30 meters long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly, and the most important thing the wheel has given us is easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result.
There are medium-sized caterpillars among those prey of medium-sized food, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In addition, many small cats (such as stray cats kept as pets) hunt for larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special job that every cat has so they don't compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called troops.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and also have up to 30 females and puppies.
The women are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large caterpillars), and that are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances and has five times as much traction as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
A tiger doesn't roar out of its full strength like a lion.
The ocelots' favorite food is small animals, which catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when they can, and the ocelot hunts almost exclusively for animals much smaller than it is.
Scientists suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by sniffing the soil where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark through night vision and move very unnoticed, hunting prey by uniting with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the large population from which they come (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river, or when they are moved to another island, from which they cannot easily return), they are often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, other resources and other enemies are present, so the new population must adapt or adapt to meet the competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population hasn't changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called species formation, and it simply involves the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in and they take in carbon dioxide that people exhale.
By photosynthesis, the plants extract nutrients from the sun and provide shade.
Our houses and clothing are made of plants, and we eat mostly plants, and without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain at the time, and he had nothing to fear from anyone except other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws had over 70 sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the abdomen, which means nothing or no one could escape him.
It's not certain, but it's possible that his tongue was forked, eating turtles, big fish, other mosasaurians, and maybe even his own kind.
In waterparties, nothing was safe from attack; even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were not a party to him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual treats, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a sleeping mouse.
There was also a difference: Poor men and women sat in chairs at the meal, but rich men liked to sit at a banquet together and lie on their sides.
Meals of ancient Rome contain no food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods, and this temple was seen as the temple of that god.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family was often out of place.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were nothing more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan had no large forests, and therefore timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was still sparsely populated, and according to Norse legend, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west, and gave it his name.
He made this discovery, but there were Eskimos living there at that time.
Although all were "Scandinavian" countries, the people, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different from each other.
After the movie National Treasure, you may think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's based on a misconception, something written on the back, but it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776'.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (from 293⁄4 inch to 241⁄2 inch) was formerly rolled up for storage.
So it seems that the designation is simply added as a kind of label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting liberated the north of France, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy France, which was French in 1940 who sided with the Germans and thus wept with the enemy instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated the south of France in just two weeks, and then they were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, which means civic, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which then means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and this also defines the shape of society in a certain way.
Urban states are the forerunners of nations, and a civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down through generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind, so they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolution, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation formed a weak central government, consisting only of a congress.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judicial power and relied on government authorities who often refused to cooperate to implement all decisions.
It also lacked the power to ignore tax laws and interstate tariffs.
First, all States had to agree unanimously to the articles before they could be amended, but the States did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German team, and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, swordfighting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (with Honshu as the largest island), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to geographically as a 'peninsula'
Taiwan's history begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe passed the island and named it Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself as a base in southwestern Taiwan, where the VOC addressed the indigenous grain production processes and employed Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Built from three large structures, Machu Picchu is made up of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three-Ram Chamber.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they used to look like.
In 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the renovation is still underway.
For example, the most common still image format worldwide is 35 mm, which was the standard film format at the end of the analog film era.
These are produced to this day, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that the digital camera's image sensor took over.
Strangely, 35mm film is actually 36mm wide, at a height of 24mm.
The image ratio of this size (division by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) would be 3:2 in that case.
Many commonly used formats (e.g. APS-like formats) are similar to or close to this image ratio.
The third-party rule, which is widely abused and considered ridiculous by many, is a simple directive that makes the image dynamic, yet clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, so you divide the image vertically and horizontally into three (see example).
At this time in Europe's history, the rich and powerful Catholic church was under fire.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states, despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the common citizen, his all-pervading power affected everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church has money for this reason.
For more than a thousand years the church was the central authority in Rome, and this relationship of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being observed.
Britain launched a naval blockade against Germany shortly after hostilities broke out.
The strategy proved effective because it was no longer possible to provide vital supplies to soldiers and civilians, but this blockade did violate the generally accepted international law that has been enshrined in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain placed mines in international waters so that ships could no longer sail across the ocean, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unarmed undersea warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After World War I, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; every phase of China or every ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between the various dynasties, during which the provinces were divided, the most famous being the Three Kingdoms period, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties in the late 19th century.
During that time, fierce wars were fought between various nobles fighting for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms era is one of the bloodiest in history, with thousands of people killed in the battle for the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution has had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism and the view that the country belongs to its people rather than a single leader.
After the revolution, all male applicants were offered positions to ensure that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same goes for the army, the ranks of the army are no longer based on a person's class but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired a revolution in other countries for the oppressed working class.
Muhammad was intensely engaged in supernatural matters, often going to a cave that later became known as the Hira Cave in the Noor Mountains for meditation.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Even if the cave was known to exist, it was not easy to find it at all.
All you can see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and there is very little to see or hear from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the countless great pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The plateau of Giza, or 'pyramids of Giza' in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples, and the great sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the women and relatives of Khufu.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a branch or a square whose bottom is missing.
Above means you have to start at the tip and push the bar away, below means you have to start at the bow frog (the place where your hand holds the bar) and pull the bar.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the liberty of drawing your personal characters, but remember that printed cartoon characters are for a musical purpose, so they usually need to be respected.
A group of market women were behind the departure of the death-stricken Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789.
They rode back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by mounting and threatening mobs threatening the royal couple.
The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their chariot completely.
At one point, someone in the crowd held the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles up in front of a fearful queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in connection with the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to finance a large part of the cost and the interest on bonds was issued through the Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
American imperialism relied largely on the enormous profits of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that gave rise to the origin of the order.
The period in which this occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the High Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which usually ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from the supply of technology or the technological obligation to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: the development of technology follows a course that largely goes beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the advent of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also causes a greater number of road accidents and this leads to the development of new healthcare techniques to restore the human body.
Romanticism included a large part of cultural determinism, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic period, geography shaped the individual and over time, customs and cultures emerged from this geography, forming a harmonious society that was better than the arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the current fashion capital.
From about 400 AD to about 1100 AD, it was known as the epicenter of luxury.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time Paris also took the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic celebrated its heyday in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, because of the slow communication channels, Western styles were 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, a distinct style began to develop in Western Europe, and one of the greatest developments was the result of the Crusades, when people began to use knots to fasten their clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture in which sufficient food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture for subsistence is a simple system, usually organic, which uses stored seeds from the ecoregion, combined with alternating crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
In the past, most farmers worked in self-sufficient agriculture, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or one or more of these factors combined.
Members of a subculture often show what group they belong to by a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave, and in the jargon they speak.
One of the most widely used methods of illustrating the importance of socialization was the few regrettable cases of children who were not socialized by adults through neglect, failure or willful abuse during their adulthood.
Some werewolves have been locked up by humans (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents refused to accept the child's severe mental or physical limitations.
Able to be trafficked children may have experienced serious child abuse or serious trauma before being abandoned or before running away.
Others claim to have been raised by animals, and some claim to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A wild child not raised by humans may display behaviour similar to that of the animal that cared for the child (within physical limits), such as fear or indifference to humans.
Project-based learning should simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, and a teacher, for example, is a form of support, but so is the Microsoft Office clipboard.
It's a virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory aids and explains procedures that students may find difficult to understand without help.
There are several reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not cared for, and where they cannot develop, but this is happening.
We consider the foster care system a safe zone for these children.
Adoption is intended to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
The Internet is bringing together elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
The different characteristics of the Internet are leading to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal engagement' and 'continuous relationships' when they examined public responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to remarkable discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is stated in particular that no one can recognize a lie by looking only at micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, described how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also possess the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
By mutation, new genetic variation is added; by selection, this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, the two groups are differentiated by separation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can get the amino acids it needs from the plant sources found there.
It can also have serious consequences: growth lag, malnutrition and eventually even death.
The easiest plant sources are the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but unless cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ant, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a very high amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" the same way chimpanzees in the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep disruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall back asleep within a short time (1060 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively soft alarm clock that brings you back to your consciousness without waking you up immediately.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you can get out of bed to turn it off.
For example, other options based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluid before bedtime (and then especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), which means getting up to pee.
The amount of inner calm a person has is compared with the amount of stress a person carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present, and each person is able to achieve satisfaction and total peace.
Anyone can lighten their mind, and only their own stress and negativity can stand in the way of that goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but this form of Buddhism is extended to the Mahayana path of love and a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and a pursuit of universal love.
Through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is aroused.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus, using the visualization of different deities to clear energy channels, activate chakras, and bring consciousness into an enlightened state.
Germany, a common enemy in World War II, established a cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
The former allies were facing each other two years after the war ended, which was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last for 40 years and proxy fights took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense forces held it only until 17 September 1939, after which they had to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were overturned in one night when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping is the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the task of the navy is to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while the enemy's ability to transport people and goods is effectively hindered.
The United States tried to get British troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean, and with this North Atlantic campaign of WWII, this is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic by using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
In ancient times, cultures and tribesmen began to keep them so that they could always easily get hair, meat, milk and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grassy area, then guarded by goat herders, as the more well-known shepherd often was a child or younger.
As early as the 16th century, horse rails were built in England.
Although horse rails consisted of only a rails of shelves, the horses were increasingly required to run faster and pull in larger quantities than on the somewhat difficult roads of the time.
Although the use of crossbars was quite early to keep the rails in place, it was gradually realized that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point at the top.
This soon became common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were laid.
The first form of transportation we know is walking, and people started walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (which means upright man) came along.
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, walked upright less often.
Two-legged specialisations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, and the Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, join an environmental movement or even take action to alleviate future suffering somewhat.
It's a lot like symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the cause of the problems and eliminate them.
Scientific and technological developments in human society have clearly changed the earth radically, and overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyles have made the problems worse.
After the Declaration of Independence was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the John Dunlap printing house a few blocks away, signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, and these are now known as the Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9, and another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap flyers are the oldest surviving copies of the document, but the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that there is still a dinosaur species that exists today.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there's a lot of things about birds that still remind me of a dinosaur.
They have claws and claws on their legs, lay eggs, and walk on their back legs, like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary numbers is the basis of almost all computers in use today.
A binary number can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that it is not immediately possible to diagnose.
The presence of open-canvas medicines or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
See the label for specific EHBO instructions for that exact poison.
This group of insects is formally called "worms" by entomologists.
The term comes from a centuries-old analogy with bed bugs, which are insects that can parasitize humans very well.
Both red predators and bed bugs nest, they have adapted to live in their host's nest or house.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder in both young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to give up their baby for adoption.
When the child is adopted, the parents relinquish parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
To discover how the world works by the scientific method is the main goal of science.
However, it is more than just experimentation; an experiment is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, question and make observations, as a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West was less and less understanding of Greek philosophy and science as knowledge of Greek declined.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, live in periodic rhythms, not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that cycle for a certain period of time, even if no external signals are emitted.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important clues that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted, one in which DNA in the phage was marked with radioactive phosphorus and the other in which the protein in the phage was marked with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type, importance of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are inherited, and other mutations can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On site, hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, parks and ecosystem study are among other things.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutan tanks in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small villages to their workplace and pass people whose workplace is located in the village they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is in some way in contact with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that this enormous carbon economy has left the biosphere unstable and allowed human evolution to take place over the past two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, water quality problems or collapsing bridges are relatively rare.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why are they failing every day? Are transport technicians simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
The traffic flow shall monitor the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to examine traffic flow because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave reasonably predictably, which means that traffic flows are consistent and there is something to be said about this mathematically.
The three core characteristics have been linked to better represent the traffic patterns: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their flying ability made it easier for them to escape enemies and to find food and mating partners more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide in a larger number of small places for predators.
Currently, only dragonflies and flying birds can't fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, and so did the sun (and other stars).
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world's second-largest and longest river, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second-largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, and in some places it is up to six miles wide.
About 20 percent of all water flowing through the rivers to the sea comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 miles [3,980 km] long, draining thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in size and technical excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was then over a thousand years old.
There are about 800 inhabitants in Vatican City, the smallest independent country in the world and also the least populous.
Italian is the mother tongue for official communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the most widely spoken language by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People know the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since they're all found in nature and it's fairly easy to dig them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is simply a combination of at least two metals, and as you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are among the metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
Alloys may also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that there are a trillion atoms that fit right at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a loyal friend to many people when it was launched.
The pen has, unfortunately, been reduced in status as new writing methods have emerged and is much less used.
Today, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a dashboard.
You might wonder what's going to happen to the keyboard as soon as something new comes to market.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like a heavy car pulling a hill, and if the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable core, which means that they break apart at the slightest or least.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the plateaus.
There may be more marinas on the side, because the crust is thinner there, and lava could have come to the surface more easily.
Content theories are all about finding out what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
With these theories, they want to explore the reasons why certain people want certain things and what environmental factors influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's need pyramid and Hertzberg's motivational hygiene theory.
Generally speaking, two approaches emerge when managers take over their former colleagues: one approach is to try to position themselves as an equal.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and disciplinary measures, conduct evaluation interviews, delegate and speak to people about their responsibilities.
On the other end of the spectrum, he transforms into an unrecognizable individual, he or she feels the need to change everything the team has done so far, and wants to make everything their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to a rift between leaders and team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are minor differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
They're often more independent than traditional team members, which is because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports, and the invisible team sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organisation want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity are shown when all available resources are effectively used within the functional departments of an organisation.
The result is that the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
To enable innovation in an organisation, management must foster a culture where innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning are at the heart.
According to Angel (2006), organisations can perform better with a continuum approach.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, which can reduce the scope of research and allow more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, wounds and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental ability.
As more and more new technologies are emerging, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us a better understanding of the processes of our minds.
AI is a science fiction idea to most people right away, but it's also an essential part of computer science, and it's used in research into machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior is a subject of AI research.
Some examples include management, planning, the ability to answer diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-life problems.
Today, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various computer and video game software applications.
Many excursions are planned for each class, and often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological advances, virtual excursions are now possible, allowing students to view artifacts in a museum, look inside an aquarium, or see beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a fantastic way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned each year and previous versions of which are kept online to serve as a flyer.
Blogs can also help students write better, and often their grammar and spelling are still poor at first, but this changes quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve writing and thus avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to learn more about the world around them".The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
When used properly, blogs can 'help students develop analytically and think critically; by actively engaging in discussion on the Internet, students can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own position on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's bilingual capital is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
Further south, you'll find Niagara Falls, and further north, you'll find the beautiful undisturbed Muskoka and more.
These kinds of things make Ontario, in the eyes of outsiders, typical of Canadians.
Further north, large areas are relatively sparsely populated and part of these areas is even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than the total number of Canadian immigrants.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of fauna, it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are self-governing or linked to France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them, and it spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region borders the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west and the Sahel region to the north.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say they are married, whether that is true or not.
It also helps to make rings (not all that expensive-looking rings).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behaviour that they see as intimidating and that it is common to be followed, to be grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be clear when rejecting a man and don't be afraid to stand up for your man (cultural differences don't say that!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids, and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but after an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina, you'll find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather goods, water pipes and other food items, but it's purely for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the eruption of lava from the Nyiragongo volcano and most of the city's streets, especially the city centre, were dammed.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, you should check the status of the fighting in the province of North Kivu before visiting outside Goma.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and offers some of the most lucrative mountain gorilla tracking trips in Africa.
By boda-boda (a motor taxi), you can get around Goma.
'Timboektoe' is relatively inaccessible and is therefore used today as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timboektoe is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of desert storms.
It was one of the main stops of the PBS show Special Wonders from the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from other cities in the country in that it has a more Arab look than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, along the border with Zimbabwe in the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wildlife species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the parade horse of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, daily maintenance fees and access fees apply.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to certain parts of South Africa's parks or to all South Africa's national parks.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which is considered by many tourists to be the most important place.
The large number of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has already been compared to a glittering bar chart that is seen through the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, you leave the island and head for the waterfront of Kowloon across the river.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's population lives very close to each other on land acquired along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, you can start here.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the entire world, stretching from the coast 80 km (50 miles) to the Indian and Bengali inland.
The Sundarbans are now officially inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove swamps  they also feature some of the last mighty pieces of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is peatland and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a game reserve since 1966 and the area now has an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis-horns.
During the day, buses leave from the station on the border of the districts (against the river) between 6.30 and 7.30 a.m. most departing mainly in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, since the regional buses are often full.
Most neighborhoods have small Japanese coaster buses that are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis allow quick and comfortable travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guiana city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the building is 378 meters long and has two aisles with a width of 3.50 meters.
The bridge is 15 metres high and was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational by September 2017.
The Guaraní were the most prominent indigenous group, living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in self-sustaining agriculture.
In Chaco Province, other indigenous tribes lived, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "great province of India", was founded in the 16th century when Spanish settlers came across the indigenous population.
There followed a three-century period of colonization by the Spanish.
Asunción was founded in 1537, and since then Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year will take place at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information on tournaments and the purchase of polo tickets.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is approximately one British pound (GBP).
There's only one bank on the islands, which is Stanley across from the FIC West store, where you can exchange money.
Generally speaking, British pounds are accepted on the islands, and in Stanley you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
In the remote islands, you probably can't pay with a credit card, but you can probably pay with British and American currency.
Exchange your money back before you leave the islands, because Falkland currencies are very difficult to exchange outside.
Montevideo is below the equator, so if it's summer there, it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures in the summer months are more than 30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures almost never go below zero, but the wind combined with humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rainfall level remains roughly the same throughout the year, with no recognizable wet and dry periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, but wild animals are just wild after all, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wildlife in the park.
Deer, bison, reindeer, bears, and almost all other large animals can attack you, however tame they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep the right distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, and the city of nearly 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port, a move later known as the infamous "patching".
All but one British battleship was sunk, nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the Mau Movement's struggle for independence, the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed in an uncontrollable nonviolent rally in the city.
There are many beaches, especially because of Auckland's two ports, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Great Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where swimming is safe and most have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
At Waitemata's harbour, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in central Auckland, you'll find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are often crowded and have a good supply of shops on the coast.
Number One is the main local beer that is not complex beer but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
Local drinking water can be simply safe to drink, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A flat white is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is espresso, cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate milk is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
Reef trips take place throughout the year and injuries from these trips to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all safety signs and warnings.
Cubus squirrels occur from October to April near beaches and river mouths north of Town or 1770.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would rather swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the riverbanks north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Booking in advance provides peace of mind for the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other accommodations, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer breakfast and transportation packages to and from the airport and sometimes even flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold you reserved if you want to think about the offer a little longer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or wish to make a change, you should do so through the travel agent rather than the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to be early to get a campsite near the music.
And remember this: Even if the music on the main stage is over, music may be played in other parts of the festival grounds until late in the evening.
For families with young children, special campgrounds are available at some festivals.
Be careful where your hut is when you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, because the ride through the ice makes a huge noise if you're too close.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city.
Casinos usually strive to make the most of the time and money spent by guests, and frames and bells are usually absent, and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have special offers in food, drink, and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic drinks, but when people get drunk, it affects their judgment and all seasoned gamblers know that it's extremely important to stay sober.
If you are going to climb mountains or climb mountain passes, you should take into account that there may be snow or ice and the temperature may be extremely low.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction and it drives through it differently than asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to get stuck.
The visibility may also be hindered by falling or rising snow or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and traffic is not hindered by this.
The main tourist attraction in Africa are safaris, which for many visitors are the highlight of their journey.
The term safari in popular usage refers to traveling overland to observe the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and standard equipment allows for a good view.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need a telescope, otherwise you're less likely to see them.
A walksafari (also called a "walking in the forest" or "walking safari") involves walking for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics are from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympics twice, the first time in 1964.
If you've booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you could be in a penniless situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will no longer be valid until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000.
You can dry wet clothes by knitting them, and many hotels have a knitting iron and a knitting pad available, and you can often borrow these things even if they're not in the room.
If there is no iron or if you do not want to wear stretched socks, you can also use a hair dryer if available.
Make sure the substance does not get too hot (this can shrink or, in extreme cases, scratch the substance).
There are many ways to purify water, and some are effective in countering specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in other areas water must be boiled for several minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective, and if in doubt, you can drink the best water from a sealed bottle from a trusted company.
Travelers may be exposed to animal plagues that do not exist in their own country.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently wound or kill people, are not normally considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers who travel to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a considerable amount of money when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Marion Point and Fairmont are connected by the Buffalo to Pittsburgh freeway, and you often drive through abandoned terrain, making this route one of the biggest challenges.
If you're not used to driving on the country roads, keep your head up, you'll find many steep slopes, narrow streets, and steep bends.
The set maximum speeds are noticeably lower than in previous and successive areas  usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h ) and it is even more important to stick to them than elsewhere.
Surprisingly, you have much more range here than at other corners of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cake tastes great and in Bavaria it is quite rich and varied, just like the cake of its southern neighbor, Austria.
You see a lot of fruit bowls, and all year round, the bowls contain apples, and in the summer months, cherries and plums.
Many popular German cakes contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and they taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a few small but powerful pastries, try some that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen in the region.
To make a curry, you need spicy and spicy ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be "dry" or "wet".
Inland North India and Pakistan also often use yogurt in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used again.
Indonesian cuisine includes dishes from 17,000 islands and is a comprehensive concept for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without further information, the term refers to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers various simple spicy dishes. The most common Javanese flavoring ingredients are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant herbs.
Lifting brackets support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but they can also cause safety problems because a rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but remains stuck with his foot in the saddle, they can be dragged along with the horse.
Most riders first wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Some saddles, and especially English saddles, have safety belts, which allow a saddle to release a climbing barrier when pulled backwards because a rider falls off the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is Chile's most popular climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes along the rock walls that seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports that involve descending, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular, such as sliding down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many lovers, sometimes called "ski bums", who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 B.C.!
The origins of skiing date back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norsemen.
Backpacking with skis: This activity is also known as off-piste skiing, skiing or ski hiking.
It's not exactly the same, but it's like alpine skiing or mountaineering, which is a lot done on steep terrain, and you need a lot more rugged skiing and boots for that.
You can see the skid road as a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover longer distances than walking, but it is rare to reach the speed of running on paved tracks without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries, and travellers between different countries usually have to apply for a visa several times and undergo passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, operates almost as one country in this area.

When you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which items produced are antique. Some tax offices give the definition of antique goods older than 100 years.
The definition may vary from place to place, for example in North America the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to label artisanal products as antique, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Among the Sami, reindeer keeping is an important way of life and the culture surrounding trade is also very important for many other occupations.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, but they engaged in fishing, hunting and other activities, wherein reindeer were usually used as draft animals.
Many Sámi people today work in modern occupations.
The word "gypsy" is used mainly by non-Roma, but it is also often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of Roma.
If you have travel advice for the country you wish to travel to, this may affect your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You can also seek advice from other governments, in addition to your own government, but their advice is directed to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations other than Europeans or Arabs.
The opinions contain only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often give a fleeting, general and extremely simplistic picture compared to other, more detailed sources.
Emergency weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, serious social disturbance or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather conditions, which vary by geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
For example, severe weather events and effects include strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and wildfires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterfalls, and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms are examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather events.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks posed by severe weather conditions in their environment, as they may also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country considered a war zone should have professional training.
A search for "course in hostile environments" on the Internet will likely yield the address of a local business.
A course normally deals with all the issues set out here in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing games, lots of EHR and occasional weapon training.
There are many books and magazines with articles on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning a sex operation abroad should ensure that they have the proper documentation for the return trip.
It varies widely whether governments wish to issue passports that do not mention gender (X), or to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents.
In addition, security inspections have become much more extensive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not had surgery can expect to be able to get through this scan with unimpaired privacy and dignity.
Mouse streams are the recurring flow of waves that break on a reef or similar and flow on the beach.
Because of the underwater topology, the return current is in some deeper areas, where a rapid flow to deep water can occur.
Most of the deaths are caused by fatigue from trying to swim against the current.
When you've escaped the strong currents, swimming back is so peepy.
Try to focus on a place where you won't get caught again, and depending on your skills and whether you're noticed, you can wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a less "marital travel feeling"), it takes longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who adapt easily to new cultures sometimes have difficulty adjusting to their own.
If you have lived abroad and then return, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits from your own culture.
In the past, when you went abroad, you would notice that people were patient and understanding, because they understood that travelers had to adapt to a new country.
Patience and understanding are not usually expected of travelers returning home.
For children, the light and sound pyramid show is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in all the silence before the show starts.
Often, the sound of vendors and tourists is always heard here.
The Sphinx is the background and the narrator of a long story.
The panels appear as projections on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by several countries.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest island being King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other is Livingston Island, and Deception, where you'll find the flooded crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with Lake Bellings House.
Here the mountains of the peninsula pass into the plateau, then emerge again to form the 360-kilometer-long mountain range Mount Ellsworth, which is crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, the highest mountain in the world at 4,892 meters.
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no cell phone reception.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to stand outside with clear vision on the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions requiring external data and communication.
Your local telephone provider can provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
It's becoming increasingly popular among people who plan to travel and learn in the middle of the year.
Especially school leavers use this to take an internship before university without adverse consequences for their education.
Often, enrolling in a foreign education program during an internship can increase your chances of returning to higher education in your home country.
In the case of the education programmes, the cost of entry is normally paid.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailing, and the 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the island groups off the coast.
A hunt is not necessary for the islands or lakes.
The islands along the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their leisure time that the ratio of boats to people is one in seven or eight.
The figure is the same as that of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, and is also quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, it is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This allows you to spend a few full days in the historic site and spend the night on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you go ashore only on a boat tour.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea.
Flying can be intimidating for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's not unlike many other people's fears.
Knowing how airplanes work can help to remove a fear of the unknown or of not having control over the plane.
Courier companies are paid a considerable fee to deliver items quickly, and time often plays a very important role in business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for a necessary repair.
Larger companies could use their own aircraft for certain routes, but it became more difficult for other routes and smaller companies.
If they ship things by air, it may take days on some routes to unload and pass through customs.
Only checked baggage could process it faster, and according to airline rules, there must be at least one passenger, and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to count a pocket of money for this privilege (or better yet, let your employer do it).
But this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about eleven times for first class.
It is usually pointless to seek discounts for business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a group of pilots who are willing to spend a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably and they therefore charge an appropriate fee for this.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova, where the Romanian language is spoken mainly, but Russian is also spoken widely.
As a multiethnic republic, Moldova was torn apart by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by the UN member states.
Economic ties have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the second largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port next to Istanbul and a good traffic hub.
The once ancient city of İzmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center on a bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping malls covered with red roofs, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditional Turks.

However, most of the signs are in Catalan, because that is the first official language by law.
Spanish is widely spoken in public transport and other facilities.
The usual announcements in the subway are in Catalan only, but unplanned interruptions are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris are known to be selfish, rude and arrogant.
Although this is usually just a false stereotype, it can't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well educated), which will make it a lot easier to explore Paris.
The hard outside of Parisians disappears quickly when you show that you're familiar with their way of doing things.
Plitvice-Meren National Park is heavily forested and this forested area consists mainly of beech, sparrow and pine, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are a number of different plant communities, particularly because of the different microclimates, different soil types and varying height differences.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and raccoon are found, among other species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt up to their knees and must have their shoulders covered.
Usually you get a blanket as a woman when you arrive at a convent unprepared, but if you bring your own copy, with nice shouting colors, the monk or nun standing at the entrance will kindly welcome you.
On the other hand, men should wear trousers at least over the knees.
You can borrow them from the store at the entrance, but these clothes aren't washed every time they're finished, so you might not feel comfortable with them.
Like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil extensively.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, especially during the summer months, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available to taste makers, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Self-identifying nouns, like Sie, which you mean, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of the sentence.
This way you make a first name difference between some verbs and objects.
It probably makes reading easier, but writing is more complicated, because you have to figure out whether to use a verb or adjective as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so pronunciation is generally not a problem.

Also, you have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means sweet, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and usually regular grammar.
So reading this introduction to grammar will already teach you much about Persian grammar and help you to understand sentences.
It makes sense that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar to this that you don't have to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now outdated, serving as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution was not as big a problem then as it is today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the sight of cherry blossoms, and it's been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers, and that's where the concept came from.
Japan's first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, which means you have to suppress the tendency to remove even "one" species.
If you collect samples during a visit to a landscaped garden, you will be denied access to the garden immediately and without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate and almost everything is available upon arrival.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Moreover, non-Christian nations and non-Christians around the world have adopted many traditions associated with the holiday.
There's a tradition where you stay all night until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with congregations often celebrating a feast of the resurrection of Christ at midnight at noon.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent, it was not possible for mammals to make the journey, making the giant turtle the most common grazing mammal in the Galapagos Islands.
Ever since humans first set foot on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
During the winter, the Arctic and Antarctic regions have a polar night, meaning that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you can see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated, so light pollution is not often a problem, which means you can also enjoy the starry skies.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal than in the Western world.
Pack is standard work clothes and colleagues call each other by last name or job name.
Unity in the workplace is crucial, with a focus on group performance rather than individual performance prices.
