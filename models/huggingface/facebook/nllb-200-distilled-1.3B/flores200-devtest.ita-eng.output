This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely held theory, but it provides more detail than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information about the evolution of birds' feathers.
Since the feathered dinosaur does not have the basic structure of the so-called spine, but instead has other features typical of feathers, beards, and barbels, researchers have concluded that the spine is likely the result of a later evolutionary development of these features.
The structure of the feather suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult feather and not the chick feather.
The researchers hypothesize that although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult plumage and not that of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two officers and injuring more than 20 people.

Police said the suspect responsible for the attack is an alleged Daesh (ISIL) militant.
They discovered that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the solar system is determined by nothing but their brightness and rotation.
The brightness is used along with the rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less the star's activity relative to magnetic inversions.

The activity was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for had to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on the Earth that generates tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same as the effects of "normal" matter.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, made up of a multitude of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters enter a secluded booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the identity is verified by the officials, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.

Candidates can send their representatives to assist at every stage of the process.In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict control, in accordance with specific procedures.

Madhya Pradesh police have managed to recover the laptop and mobile phone that were stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman.
The names of the accused are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to the police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house when the car crashed were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his own son.
She is being held pending trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be contaminated, as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judiciary has other parameters, as the Scottish courts have found the publication of the photos to be potentially harmful.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects are walking on a minefield".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for the proceedings, has told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the formal indictment.
According to the leaked documents, the document will be about the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other issues reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the experimental pest control program had to be closely monitored by the rangers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme, NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of NPWS' Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly was sworn in to a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the former CEP.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime which began in October.
Occasional violent protests have been sparked by the failure of elections, some of which were scheduled as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods were reported, which caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
In its response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report "absolutely deplorable".
The Mariana Islands earthquake was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage was reported in the nation.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami in the works.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Most of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were immediately released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
After training as an obstetrician, she joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began to study cases of preterm labor in her spare time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' with flight recordings on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme, my first manager, she died on the night of the two moons, unique, just like her, a strong woman".
"Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even stranger... I love her and I'll miss her... we hope she's in a better place", was Dustin "Goldust" Runnels' comment.
According to a survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of those surveyed, who believe Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
In contrast, 29 percent of those polled say Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent say it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay at the Commonwealth Games, but has suffered several ailments that have led to doubts about her fitness.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to get over the pain because it's banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to earth - the matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the earth formed from collisions with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since early this year as governor; last month he signed a bill making same-sex marriage legal.
He says speculation is nothing but "political gossip and nonsense".
He is considered a presidential candidate in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of the outdated ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being set up and no surface trains will stop at Wembley, while no car parks or interchange parking are available on site.
Fears of lack of transportation have raised the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird is believed to have been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time needed for this process was much longer, as a result of the mating of an endemic Darwin's fringe, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus fringe, Geospiza conirostris.
They can be worked into any shape, they can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to form a thin thread, suitable for twisting and weaving, and can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals, and sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "mined codes" because of the ability to be made so thin.
So using the juice of red cabbage, you can build a pH gauge.
The color of cabbage juice varies according to how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the analytical chemical is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the H for pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been stripped (as hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, put them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands and the outer layers will cause a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a running water bath connected to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, remains of sewer networks have been discovered in the dwellings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes placed in public baths, frequented by a mixed public of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
To carry a satellite or telescope into space requires a rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world enormously, and the most important of the many advantages it has brought us is that it has made transportation easier and faster.
His invention led to the introduction of the train, the automobile, and various other means of transportation.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on small, considerably larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that each cat has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called packs.
The flocks are made up of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and cubs that can reach 30.
Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lion pack acts very similarly to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other large cats), even as far as deadly attacks on their prey are concerned.
A complete athlete: The tiger can climb (though not too well), swim, jump very far, and exert five times the traction of a strong man.
The tiger is a member of the same family (the Panthera genus) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it more closely resembles a phrase of screaming and angry words.
Ocelots like to feed on small animals, and if possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find food by scent, sniffing the ground where they have been.
With their night vision, ocelots can see very well in the dark, and they can move about stealthily, masquerading as their prey and then rushing into it.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, thus making a possible return difficult), it will likely find itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment is characterised by different resources and competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those previously required.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it looks less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from one another that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they expel (through exhalation).
Plants process their sun-fed food through photosynthesis.
We build our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaur was the super predator of his era and therefore feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
From its long jaws protruded more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row on its palate, so there was no escape for anyone who crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a bifurcated tongue, and his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's also possible that he was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with it.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also featured several odd or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent species called the ghiro.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to feast together by lying on one side while consuming their meal.
Of course, the ancient Romans' meals did not include various foods, which came to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the god's dwelling place.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Because of the mild climate of the Middle East, the home was not of primary importance.
Much of the Jewish family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, while shops were simple open-air stalls overlooking the street.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was especially expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red named it after meeting Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all of them were "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map.
Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776".
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Probably, then, the annotation was just put on as a label.
The D-Day landings and ensuing fighting had led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those Frenchmen who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. This offensive was called Operation Dragoon.
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were moving toward Germany.
Civilization is a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil; the term is in turn connected with civis, that is citizen, and civitas, that is city or city-state, and in a certain way it also defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nationhood.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, with Congress as the sole component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, in the absence of executive or judicial power at the national level, relied on often uncooperative state authorities to enforce its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
The amendment of the Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, which had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is referred to as an "archipel", given the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who were passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Wonderful Island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, beginning a transformation that involved the aboriginal grain production systems and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, and notably the Intihuatana, The Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30% of the site of Machu Picchu had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most commonly used at the end of the analogue photography era.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the formats (for example the APS family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-exploited and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point at which to place the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds, either vertically or horizontally (as in the example).
At this point in European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had been the glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power has affected everyone from kings to common citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth is to be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's money reserves exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the church remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that this blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified in multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
Because this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and ferocity of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his supervisor in the previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way: each period of China or each ruling family constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars broke out between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since the rankings of the army, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers a very clear picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find, even if you knew it existed.
Nothing is seen but a beautiful clear sky and a great deal of mountains around it. From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of the world around you.
Of the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived intact.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plain, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "upward" sign looks like a V and the "downward" sign looks like a staple or a square without the bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the armrest (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards you.
An upward bow usually produces a softer sound, while a downward bow produces a stronger, more decided sound.
You may decide to add your own customized pencil indications, but keep in mind that the archaic signs you find printed have musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, terrified, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the rulers.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war costs of US imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the cost, and the interest on the bonds was swinging on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly the enormous profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people were the profits underlying US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages and were followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which conventionally ended in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense according to which the fate of man is moved by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new life-saving techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Within the framework of romanticism, geography conditioned individuals, and over time, customs, customs, and culture related to that geography emerged that, being in harmony with the context of society, proved more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Like Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its notoriety as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the 12th century its prestige declined, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The height of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slow pace of communication means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Subsistence farming is defined as farming for the sole purpose of producing enough food to meet the food needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic system that uses preserved seeds from the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar views who do not feel represented by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Often members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse grew up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "wild" or wild.Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
Children in foster care may have suffered severe violence or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral baby is totally raised by nonhuman animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference toward man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while the scaffold goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mode, but rather an aid for those who are embarking on a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is an example of a scaffolding, but so is the little stapler assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, prompt and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty handling on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse, if not extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not provide them with nutrition, care and education, but they do.
We believe that foster care is a safe haven for these children.
Our childcare system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The trustee is supposed to make up for all the unmet needs in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of theory of uses and rewards.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of audience reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to discover whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people who are unable to understand spoken language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, a new genetic variability is added, with selection it is removed from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences - stunting, malnutrition, and eventually even death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest unless they're cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In view of all of this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way that savannas chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep, followed by a resumption of sleep (1060 minutes later).
This process can be easily implemented using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness, without fully waking you up.
If you decide to reset the clock to sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options involve drinking plenty of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace in proportion to the tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive the life force that exists. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and that goal is only hindered by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana rite's path of love and various Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the focus of Tibetan meditation, where the depiction of various deities clears energy channels, activates chakras and develops enlightenment consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to the collaboration between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had become enemies; the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and it would be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other countries.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken through; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans soon proved obsolete, however, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships for freight transport is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navy has always been to ensure that the country maintains its ability to move people and goods, while countering the ability of the enemy to move people and goods.
One of the more recent examples to support this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II, during which the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany probably would have had a chance to conquer Britain, as it had in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They began to be raised by cultures and tribes of antiquity for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds left free to move about the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goat herders (similar to shepherds) who were often children or teenagers.
As early as the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although they were simply formed of parallel wooden axes, wagonways, when compared to the slightly more bumpy roads of the period, allowed horses to travel at higher speeds and to move heavier loads.
The beams were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place, but gradually it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, even though the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron ones. In 1767 the first all-iron rails appeared.
The first means of transportation known to man were legs. Humans began walking in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk normally erect.
Signs of specialization for bipedal gait are present in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate some of the future suffering we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even be activist.
In many cases, this only works as a symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problem and disable it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, while problems have increased because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the John Dunlap printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as "The Dunlap Posters".
The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the task was given to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 known Dunlap embroideries are the oldest extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today say that one category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics in common with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have scaled feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs.
In short, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers in use today.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and in computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but its symptoms, including vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of harmful medicines or chemicals in the home.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both killer and bed bugs are nest-dwelling, that is, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the United States, multiple sclerosis (MS) accounts for about 400,000 known cases, making it the number one neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely as males to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or that of their child.
These couples have the option of choosing an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific inquiry.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also help to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have noted that physiological rhythms and behavior are largely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was genetic material was one conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the affected cells belong to the germline.
Mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Naturalistic tourism draws people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities to be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small rural villages to drive to work, crossing other people whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic of going back and forth, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which at the same time support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stable conditions that has allowed human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in social life and uses transport systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behaviour tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so in turn traffic flows tend to show a reasonably constant and can be represented generically in a mathematical way.
In order to obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape their enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small burrows to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and the short-lived dragonfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed that he was right, but many others believed otherwise - that the solar system, including the sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't get the sense that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying eight times the amount of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on earth, reaching six miles in width at some points.
Twenty percent of the total water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Rio de la Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and thousands of smaller tributaries flow into it.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical excellence.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted by the monuments of their ancestors, which were well over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper in antiquity: these elements can be found in nature in their native form and can be extracted quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These actually resemble the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil has thus proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and to a less and less widespread use.
Nowadays, everyone writes messages on their computer screens and never has to go near a temperamite.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the fission bomb.
It's basically like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and then, by further splitting the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust, and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
The maria could be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people have in common and what drives them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that drive them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most widespread content theories are Maslow's Theory of Needs Hierarchy and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start managing their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge: on the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager becomes a completely different person, who feels the need to change the entire team's operations and do it himself.
At the end of the day, a leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often causes disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings may take place in different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member refers and which sets the standards for each member.
A good reason for implementing organizational learning concepts may be innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the collaborative path within an organisation to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organisation to be innovative, it is necessary that leaders create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological findings have shown the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition.
The link between brain disease and behavior is at the heart of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and cancer can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before observed.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our own mental processes.
Despite its strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
AI research includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as writing, speech and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
The excursions are a fundamental part of the teaching process, and teachers often want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is technology with virtual tours, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are stored online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing, as their first experiences with blogs are often marked by poor grammar and spelling, but usually the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the blog author works to improve the writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them". The need to nurture public interest motivates students to be resourceful and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students' learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical.By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, with its art galleries and museums that tell the story of the country's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north you can see the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All of this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas to the north are sparsely populated, some of them almost uninhabited wilderness.
If you compare the population, the result may surprise many: In the United States, there are more African-American citizens than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxury seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which made a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape Route, which ran from Europe to India, by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way for European influence and colonialism.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women travellers: all are recommended to declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, to be held by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to oppose (cultural differences or not, there is no excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a strategically important port used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenides.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city, which was called Daru l-Badya, later called Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose these places for their trading bases.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least attractive cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and lots of junk food, but all this is reserved for tourists only.
Goma is a resort town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to do some research before making any visits outside Goma, so as to properly assess the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the climb to Nyiragongo Volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see Africa's mountain gorillas.
A boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) is available to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctú" has become a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a decayed city, but its reputation remains a tourist attraction, with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In PBS's Henry Louis Gates special "Wonders of the African World", she was one of the main stages.
With its more Arab than African touch, the city stands out clearly from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, northward borders Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the most important of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily fees for conservation and entrance to the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card may also be useful, as it gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart, made even more evident by the Victoria Harbour's water.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island has been concentrated on the heavily populated reclaimed land of the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists chose for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of this land's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland to Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps. They also contain the remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, with an estimated 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district motorway station (across the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses that run between different districts are often full, it is good to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable, sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby resorts, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a through-arch bridge connecting the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two trusses are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two lanes of 3.50 metres wide.
The construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
By September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish ushered in a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Minor tournaments and games are also held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their own official currency, the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley is often also available for payment with credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted on the outlying islands, although UK and US currencies may be accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; temperatures above 30°C are quite normal during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature below that recorded by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to human sight, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards from all other wildlife.
No matter how tame they may seem - bison, moose, deer, bear - virtually any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping a proper distance, and it is necessary to give these animals adequate space as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also, keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking food with strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on Upolu Island and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This was the site of the infamous 1889 naval stalemate, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the town led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is located between two ports.
The Pacific Ocean beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mostly sandy, safe beaches, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide variety of shops.
The most well-known local beer is a simple, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One".
You can have a lot of French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines might be better suited to the journey.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to the Australians, flat white coffee is a foreign idea, with espresso being the short black coffee, cappuccino being covered with cream (not foam), and tea being served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on the same level as Belgian. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Many hikes are made on the reef year-round, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, follow directions, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cube jellyfish appear from October to April near beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of them and tend to keep their distance.
The saltwater crocodile's habitat is mainly the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, with no active ocean life.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind that he will find a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, but other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, can still be booked through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer breakfast packages, airport transfers or even flight+hotel combined packages.
They can also keep the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents (e.g. visa) for your destination.
However, any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
In some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this a crucial part of the experience.
To be close to the action, you need to get there early and get a space near the music.
Remember that after the music on the main stages has finished, there may be sections of the festival where the music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since crossing the ice causes rather annoying noises for those most exposed.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city.
Generally, casinos do everything they can to maximize the time and money spent by their guests.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests in a high mood and keep them in line.
In some clubs, alcoholic beverages are offered at the door, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures near freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and you cannot drive as you would on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you get stuck.
Rainfall and snowfalls, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the focal point of many visitors' holidays.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to trips made overland, especially in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes fearful, and this makes them easier to observe with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, with some events taking place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, the first being in 1964.
If your 2020 flight and accommodation reservations were made before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult position.
Cancellation policies vary, however most cancellation policies related to coronavirus, as of late March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Many hotels offer the use of an iron and an iron shaft, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer, if available.
Care should be taken not to subject the fabrics to too high a temperature to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways of treating water, and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if in doubt, consider buying water packed in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not common in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are not usually classified as pests.
Duty free shopping is an opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult to drive, often traversing isolated areas of vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, you should keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow streets, and narrow curves predominate.
The speed limits are much lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h).
Strangely, though, the mobile phone coverage in this area is much higher than in other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those in neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are an endless classic, from those with apples available year-round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small but rich sweets can opt for those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
Inland regions of northern India and Pakistan normally use yogurt for curries; coconut milk is more common in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating in the central and eastern area of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a range of simple dishes; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The braces are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but may present safety problems for the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a jockey is knocked over by a horse but has a foot stuck in the brake, he may be dragged by the running horse.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a high heel and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially those in Britain, had safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to detach from the saddle when the rider pulls it back in case of a fall.
Cochamó Valley: Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with its many huge granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world continually trace new paths along its potentially endless walls.
Snow sports in free fall, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve sliding on snow using skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums" (the skiers), who devote entire vacation periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first rock paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins in at least the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Skiing: The activity is also called outdoor skiing, ski mountaineering or ski trekking.
It is related, though usually not including, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on rough terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a hiking trail.
If conditions are good, you can cover somewhat longer distances than those trails by walking, but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on the beaten track.
Europe is a relatively small continent but is made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through several countries you would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, saving you time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique; some tax agencies consider it to be at least 100 years old.
The definition differs geographically from the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft items could be defined as antique pieces, even if they are more recent than similar items produced in series.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some lived off fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as working animals.
Today, many Sámi people have modern professions, and tourism is an important source of income in Sámi territory.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.

For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The alerts are simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
'Adverse weather conditions' is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography, and weather conditions.
Strong wind gusts, hail, above-normal rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, thunderstorms and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather events of high intensity include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to check for adverse weather conditions in their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a country potentially considered a war zone must undergo vocational training.
If you search the Internet for 'Hostile Environments Course', you are likely to find the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually drawing on practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are widely available, while few publications deal with war zones.
Travellers who are planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents with them for the return journey.
The intention of governments to issue passports without gender (X) information or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents is also variable.
Security inspections have also become much more thorough in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people in preoperative stages should not expect to pass screening without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rip currents are the return flow of waves that break on the beach, often near a reef or similar formation.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most deaths occur because of fatigue in trying to swim against the current, which may prove impossible.
Once you're out of the current, getting back to the water won't be any harder than it used to be.
Try to identify an area where you are not likely to be trapped again, or consider whether to wait for help, based on your skills and whether you have been spotted.
Return shock is shorter in duration than culture shock (there is a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adjust to a new culture sometimes have difficulty readjusting to the culture of their home country.
When you return home from living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your native culture.
In your first experience abroad, you are likely to meet people who are patient and understanding, aware that travelers to a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not realize that patience and awareness were needed for those returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is the most interesting thing in the area for children.
Before the show begins, you can admire the pyramids in the darkness and silence.
Normally, you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors, and the sound and light show is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, the caldera of a still-active volcano filled with water from a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula overlooking the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the peninsula mountains merge into the plateau, then emerge again to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360-mile range cut in half by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, where there is no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a cell phone, because to call one must be outdoors with the view clear to the satellite.
The service is often used by recreational boats, including recreational boats, as well as missions that require remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about how to connect to this service.
One of the more popular options among those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular among recent graduates, since they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education when returning to your home country.
Usually, there is a fee for enrolling in these educational programmes.
Finland is an ideal destination for surfers, and the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to go to the archipelago and the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, where one boat is counted for every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is rather rare (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two full days, getting back on the ship in the evening to sleep.
For landings, a separate visa will not be required (as of 2009) using boarding trips.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be scary for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of - it is not unlike the personal fears and aversions many people have toward other things.
For some people, a little understanding of how planes work and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown, or the lack of control.
Couriers are well paid for delivering products quickly. Often timeliness is very important in the case of company documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes the larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems arose.
On some routes, air shipments would take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as hold baggage, and that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow you to ship baggage without a passenger.
To fly first class or business class the most obvious way is to pay a good amount for the privilege (or, better yet, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: indicative, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business travel and up to eleven times the fare for first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it is not even worth looking for discounts on first-class or business-class seats.
Airlines know that there is a category of travelers who are willing to pay big money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge certain fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău and the local language is Romanian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been the scene of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Smyrna is Turkey's third largest city, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation crossroads.
The ancient city of Smyrna is built on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and is now a modern, developed and active commercial centre.
Although the city has a more Mediterranean than traditional Turkish atmosphere, its wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with distinctive red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and visit a unique octagonal church.
In the sacristy of the church, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble carvings of doves.
A half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and charming city of Sintra, easily accessible, which became famous to foreigners thanks to Lord Byron's brilliant account of its splendors.
The Scotturb 403 bus operates regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Further north, visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions famous throughout the world.
Remember that the site you're visiting is basically a mass grave, and it has almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived in these places, and many more who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, whether Jewish or not.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves, avoiding jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by smearing signs or graffiti on the structures.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most sign language is written exclusively in Catalan, which is the first official language by law.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
In the metro, regular announcements are only in Catalan, and any unplanned service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automated system.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude and conceited.
Although this is often just a vague stereotype, the best way to feel good in Paris is still to behave as well as possible, behaving like a "bien élevé" (well-educated) person.
The rough exterior of Parisians will fade quickly if you show some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, predominantly beech, fir and fir, and is characterised by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels, it has a wide variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a huge variety of animal and bird species.
These places are home to rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and cedar rooster, along with several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stools for women who come unprepared, but if you already have one, especially one in bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear knee-high pants.
These too can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each wear, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and all available condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, except for the pronoun "You" used for the polite form that stands for "You", always start with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing between certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also makes reading easier, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantiated form makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are the c and the g, since their pronunciation changes according to the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure that you pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: dear means beloved, while chariot means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple grammar and is usually regular.
So reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and with understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a modicum of knowledge of Spanish may jump to the conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore does not need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are huge structures in remote areas where the weather conditions are favorable.
Admiration of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept originated in China, where the flowering of plums was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants are at their best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just" one.
If you visit an Italian garden, even picking up a few plants will cost you the trouble of leaving the place, no questions asked.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to get around; you can buy just about anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with heat (always) and strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes into Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme for a vacation.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities on the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.

Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition is to spend the night of Easter awake in an open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual connected with spring and fertility.
In the more traditional Churches an Easter vigil is frequently held on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, with congregations often starting the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the considerable distance from the mainland, mammals could not cope with the journey, and this made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs, and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to witness the Northern Lights, because the sky remains dark for most of the day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem, and you can even enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be used to.
Office clothing normally consists of a jacket and tie or a suit and is addressed to colleagues by their surname or professional title.
Workplace harmony is of crucial importance, as it emphasizes group commitment rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive approval from their superiors on every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without question.
