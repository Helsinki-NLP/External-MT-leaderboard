I'm a #PRS_ORG# big customer and so it's not a problem for me.
All I need is a number or an instruction on what to attach to the package so you can track it as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG a few days ago... for $249.
Today it costs 179 euros.
I find that very annoying, to be honest.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way to get the credit?
I also think that in principle children should not be forced to assume the role of parents for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is good for older siblings to share in the care of the younger ones.
I'll look, I'll help, I'll bring the bottle, and so on.
This teaches them responsibility, helping and involvement in the family.
As long as they can be child enough, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is on his own for a short time and it's okay with him, that's fine.
You can judge for yourself whether this is appropriate for your children.
It's not like he's gonna wrap K2 up and spend hours sleeping with you.
It's probably questionable from a legal standpoint.
Perhaps that's why the psychologist said so.
Because if something were to happen, like a fire, a burglary, an earthquake, an alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that's a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion.
Please help me find the title of a book.
I remember reading a thriller a few years ago and I can remember almost the whole plot but I can't think of the title "partout"
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a pet keeper commits suicide by pouring food on himself and going to his predatory cats' enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation, turns to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who's also afraid of fire and she ends up with this therapist.
There's more suicides, and there's another protagonist -- a photographer who is hired anonymously before every suicide to go to the scene and document and post the photos on the Internet.
Anyway, it turns out that this therapist is running a kind of underground group therapy where the patient is implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients end up facing their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out the window another drives off with the intention of death)
This facing fear is called "the fight" in the book.
There's a big showdown at the clinic that ends up involving a fire.
This is so rough plot I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone knows about this plot or even if anyone can tell me the title of the book, I'd be very happy.
Oh, my God, I don't have the password for the WLAN.
I'll have to contact my husband first.
It may take a while.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it possible to get the difference in price refunded ?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wood splinters under the thumbnail (outside) along the entire length.
Tried to pull him with a tweezer.
Very hard to catch.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the kid reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
We're going to the doctor tomorrow.

Johnson wants to push for refill vaccination
The increasing number of Omicron cases is causing concern in British politics and science.
The aim is to provide all eligible adults in England with a vaccine by the New Year.
LONDON - Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move even faster than previously planned on the coronavirus vaccination roll-out in the face of rapidly rising Omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second shot, Johnson told his countrymen in a pre-recorded video message on Sunday evening.
The target date has been the end of January.
The UK Government will also provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the countryside of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Omicron variant is an emergency and there is an urgent need to strengthen immunization, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose.
"Let's get pissed off!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared with the previous day, this was a whopping 65% increase.

I'm all for people introducing themselves with pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today, the invitation to an interview came by mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I Googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
I don't know how to write the e-mail.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on the feet of any official.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have five books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had an unseen shortcoming in sales.
How else can a padding damage like this happen after nine months ?
I'll try it on the #PRS_ORG.
It's been working for about a year.
14 days is over.
So I always bought the latest books through the website and then read them on #PRS_ORG.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
But there were none.
Now they're available again, and I want you to please add two chairs to the order and charge me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I'm going to write a little bit more about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something from the heart.
I (21) have more contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One of the issues that really bugs me, and unfortunately, it's been all too common, is that many victims are not being helped or think we can't help them.
I'm very aware that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything about situations like this.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a face-to-face conversation with the perpetrator, far from sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, some of them very close to tears, is that everyone deserves to be able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just take violence.
I often wish I could help in any way... I know I can't.
It's never going to get any easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the relationship between the series and "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, a lot of complicated names, a stunning layout: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we so excited about the two seasons that have already been announced?
Basketball league: Derby debacle of the MHP Giants Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Youngster John Patrick was reliable.
For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost at Crailsheim - and how!
Before the match, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back on the Cup defeat at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
The score did not settle after the game, but increased again after the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
And more than the naked result, the way it was performed was disappointing.
A statistic is given that illustrates the whole dilemma: the three-way score was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick answered: "After the win in Tenerife, we just weren't focused enough and didn't put into practice what we were training for".
That is, to move the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "It's a great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time", said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people".
On Saturday, only 750 people were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they paid their fair share.
Not least because BBL's all-time leading scorer, T.J. Shorts, scored 22 points and led his team in scoring.
"The best player I ever coached", Gleim continued.
While in Patrick's team, even the powerhouse players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed all the way.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already been 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon came in with 12 points.
Fortunately, there's not much time left to waste.
The giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday at 7 p.m. and Ludwigsburg before a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I already signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all the claims for the guarantee were rejected.
We have re-inquired about the law and have written to you again.
We originally signed up six months ago.
Max Rabe is 59 years old
He can delight his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He's currently on the road with the "Good Day, Dear Happiness" program - if he's allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it's not gonna work.
The concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "by official order" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season will also have to be cancelled, according to the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists will try to catch up on their dates already set for 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing since he was a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his hit album "For Women It's No Problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blonde hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is unthinkable in the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new dwelling
The new Federal Minister for Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing groups, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes", Geywitz said in an interview with the daily newspaper "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the assurance that their rent will remain affordable for years to come.
A colourful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations, for example, is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition on further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price curb until 2029, limiting rent increases in tense housing markets and expanding the rental level.
I'll talk to the Attorney General to get this done as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps", the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 dead in Kentucky tornadoes
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept across the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there remind me of a war zone.
On the night of Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States caused severe damage and may have killed up to a hundred people.
The storms leave a devastating 200-mile-long (320 km) trail, mostly in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado had passed, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - just go.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to 100 deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising by the hour.
Hi, I just saw that she sold out of showcases.
That's too bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely out of the range?
Is it possible to order these display cases in another country?
When will you be back?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the cart?
I had returned an article or submitted a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it had arrived or was being processed, as I had not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising slogans
While the German government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering cash premiums for vaccination to their employees.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Economic Chamber, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising slogans to vaccination calls - following the German model - is also intended to increase the readiness for Corona vaccinations.
He switched to a company he'd slandered.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't stick to his old job and he was looking for something else.
You can, too.
And that he didn't like you back then, I don't care.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.
I'm going to take a screenshot.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to the grass!
I'm currently running the Over the Grapple Pass adventure for a group of four friends, and I want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts devised, and now I'm writing the entry adventure, and I'm already stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a truckload of grain from the mountain range to a small village near Lake Thuran.
That's where the rest of the story is going to take place.
A few miles from the village, the hero is to be ambushed by a group of goblins.
I want to give the characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: persuasion, action, threat, early detection of danger, whatever comes to mind for the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
At no notice, the goblins ambush the hero in a hollow path and flank the wheel with three left and right me bows armed, while two with spears stop the wheel.
If it comes to combat and the heroes fall, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolboy, a half-elf.
The cart's gone, of course.
If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf with two of his minions will come to the hero's aid in the battle.
The car is still here, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina is to solution 2?
Is the encounter too much to begin the adventure?
The Goblin group will play a crucial role later, so it's not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm sure I'll listen to many of your ideas and I'm confident in my narrative again.
I reassembled the lamp.
And back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That 's why I 'd like to send them back anyway .
Can you get the receipts to come in, then I can wrap the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG.

I 'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello, F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality of the German sky has been getting worse and worse, so I'm going to take a breath with this post.
For the first time, the broadcast was interrupted today in the middle of the F2 race to allow the F1 preview to begin on time.
Although the delayed start and the launch accident meant that the schedule was far behind schedule, the final ten minutes (planned) and the championship decision (!) could still have been shown.
But apparently, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE had no choice here.
Still, stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race at the end.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Olivier Zwartyes, on his excellent work in the difficult situation surrounding the accident.
Then there was another F1 rule-ignorance by commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so they both didn't know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation had already been seen in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both decided that Verstappen could change the tyres only when there were corresponding radio speeches on the subject to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I think that such elementary rules should be easily known when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It's not the first riddle, either, that's possible or required by the rules, both of which just have constant uncertainties about the rules.
I don't like the way Roos is making up his comments, but I'll admit it's a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko Waters from RTL better.
And then there are the constant stupidities that make both seem unprofessional, like ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or Ralf Schumacher's "UuuuuHD".
The latter in particular is causing a lot of unrest in the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the qualifying round Sky is the only station that goes into the advertising, as you can hear on F1TV since only the German soundtrack without commentary has to come out right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing that.
Also, these two stations do less advertising in training than Sky does, and that's as a free-to-air TV station.
I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's schedule is also very sparse and full of repetitions.
All in all, Sky is the worst German-language broadcaster for F1.
Ironically, RTL is doing a better job than the commercials on the four races they're allowed to broadcast.
So anyway, the grand F1 season is a lot less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
Here's to this: #PRS_ORG# pendulum light, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still isn't.
I've contacted the chat room twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it's going to be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she's going to check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG # on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front of the chair).
I'm asking for backup.
Air pumps are excellent for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using air lifts.
This series is offered in three variants by us.
Look at the chart at the end of the offer.
You can see the performance comparison there.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run entire plants with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. Ventilator pumps are also suitable for accentuating the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a decor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
This is a treasure chest, shellfish or something.
The MK series has a special soundproofing design, which ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or other equipment by means of a 4/6 mm air hose and can be started.
The fan pump should be at or above the water level and should be installed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a backflow valve should be placed between them.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent, once water flows backwards, the water from the basin going through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, as other air pumps are.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages, which consume little energy
Even if we say 3 days here on ebay, packages are packed daily and packages are picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it's very fast.
We are simply trying to prevent a slight discrepancy, so that no one is dissatisfied just because it took a little longer.
It would be like, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping industry...of course here no Corona stops.
Please don't give me a bad rating just because the delivery is delayed, it's all because of the parcel service.
Of course, you like to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment...they're having a hell of a time.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be mad at anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you get the legs in the light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and anchor into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard missile system, the company of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The flight, which lasted about ten minutes, took off and landed in the western U.S. state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly recruited astronauts on their return.
"Welcome back", said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
Laura Shepard Churchley, 74, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew in space in 1961 as a NASA astronaut, after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of honor at the company, which had paid for their tickets for four other passengers: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for each ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He's had to work hard on his assignments and do everything himself.
"She just flew away", the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He'd like to go back to space right away, the presenter said.
The New Shepard is flying up to 100 kilometers.
The New Shepard missile system is largely automated.
The capsule, which was detached from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 60 miles [100 km] above the earth, at times with zero gravity, before the reusable object was re-landed, slowed by large parachutes.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the earth as the limit to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third all-man flight: the first in July included Amazon founder Bezos himself, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second, in October, was attended by 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin executive vice president Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of mankind and without regard for the climate.

Anyone working in biochemistry or studying biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject quite exciting in itself and even standing in the laboratory does not bother me (I have already done the inorganic chemistry internship).
I have, of course, been looking into career prospects before I started my studies, but I have also been thinking about the time when I would like to study and will do so.
I have doubts, especially about the prospects for my career.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.) you hear all the time about great job opportunities and the job being totally sought after, on the other hand you hear all the time about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That 's why I 'd be interested .
1) What are you working on now?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What did you study/ what training did you take?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers.
I'm really insecure right now, and I'm thinking about maybe dropping out of college in 2022 and getting an education to become a computer scientist.

Extra stress before holidays and public holidays
This topic came to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why I'm not gonna post it.
Not only before big holidays like Christmas, but there's a lot of stress in the workplace.
Apparently, they have it before holidays and bridge days.
Last week was the Ascension of Mary, which we in Switzerland call the Ascension.
On Friday, most people and businesses have a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So, last week, we had a long four-day weekend at the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress is everywhere.
All those emails that had to be sent before we got back, orders here and orders there, all "need" before the long weekend.
Because... yeah, because?
Because "Next week then" sounds like so much time and it can't be?
Or because people are as eager to accomplish as they would in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very nervous.
What's with the holiday-related self-pity?
What good are holidays if we can't afford them?
The stress was not from above, it was all on their own.
My question is simple: Are we the only ones like that, the Swiss?
Is that our Reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld, 42, is looking forward to Christmas in her home town of Thuringia - but she has no presents yet.
"The beautiful thing is that even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian forest", the actress and singer told Hit Radio FFH.
She'll be in tune with the party by baking and baking with her son, Plätzchen.
"I love that", said Catterfeld.
But until the days of reflection, she has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any presents, I have to start now".
NEKTON-Bio supports smooth movement of the mice and the formation of feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all the vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg of biotin per kg of food that are essential for life.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage in poultry production is due exclusively to dietary deficiencies.
Since the feathers are made of protein, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet is essential for the formation of a perfect feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses during the mice are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein and/or vitamin and mineral supply.
The composition of NEKTON-bio explicitly takes into account and balances the unfavourable amino acid ratio in most plant-based feed.
No other vitamin preparations should be given during the use of NEKTON-bio.
NEKTON-bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you very much, I found it.
Still not working, unfortunately.
GDR hand-built model E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with spark tracks and missing parts see photos, function well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesia network, possibly the construction equipment also comes from the small series company ZSCHUCH and BTSKEMANN.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have it up and running
In 1924 the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive capable of carrying 2,200 tonnes of coal and 530 tonnes of passenger trains on this route at a travel speed of 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the GDR decided to supply the mechanical part as 1Co+Co1 locomotives with a Tatzlager drive to AEG, and the electric part to Siemens Schuckertwerke.
From December 1927 to June 1928 six locomotives were delivered, which were given the number E 95 0106.
All survived World War II and were later found in the territory of what became the GDR.
In 1946 the locomotives were delivered to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
The repair works at the Dessau Railway were able to verify the repair quality of all six locomotives.
[4] As the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network led to an increasing need for heavy goods train locomotives, the three E 95 01 to E 95 03 locomotives were upgraded in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94 were built first, as they were available in larger numbers.
Only when it was clear that the number of E 94s could not be increased further did the E 95s come under the scope of the revision.
[4]First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren Railway Works.
They came to the railway works, Halle P, in 1960.
They were used in a separate route plan, mostly before coal trains from the Geisel valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The problem with increasing age was the complex control of the locomotives.
It was common for gunmen to stick to their guns during a shootout.
Then the Beiman, who was always on the train, had to untie the gun with a hammer and a wooden spike.
Damage to the driving engines was frequent and led to months of locomotive failure.
As there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and no significant expansion of the electric operation was planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most splinter types, so the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition, the German Railways wanted to staff electric locomotives only by one man, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the difficulties with the machines and the visibility conditions from the driver's seat.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in mid-1969, the last of these was the E 95 01, which was withdrawn from service on 5 October 1970.
The new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
All locomotives except E 95 02 were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a heating switch at Halle Central Station.
It took some time before the authorities at the Reichsbahn were convinced that the E 95 was worthy of preservation as a museum locomotive.
In 1979 the first external work on the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a car show at RAW Dessau.
The railway was built in the early 1900s by the German railway company Dresden-Lothringen.
In 1986 the locomotives were completed internally.
The locomotive is kept in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the traditional Bw Halle P community have been working on the upgrading of the locomotives to be operational.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior painting, with the transformers checked and five driving engines operational.
-The locomotives were used on the Schleswig Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945 the machines were relocated to Leipzig for use in the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handmade model H0 in OVP, function well, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary in self-work, dusty, with game traces, basement smell !!!, very rare handmade model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
Packaging may contain labels and storage marks.
Yeah, the F-parts are.
I got a bed from you.
There was a problem with one part, though.
The central beam is held by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we gonna do?
I can't make the bed.
The centre beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately produced by faulty means.
The centre beam does not fit into the intended support.
So I get new ones sent in.
When are they going to be sent?
No, not flat.
These are, according to the assembly manual, the correct ones of the shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is they serve their purpose
They 're not flat with me
Could I have these sent?
Hello #NAME#, do you want me to explain the problem again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and heavy damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage was caused in the six-digit euro area, police said Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume that it was arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it'll be a lot later.
And I have to pay for shipping again.
To counter fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not commented publicly on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur posted a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has posted a photo showing him receiving a coronavirus vaccine.
There was a lot of misinformation on social media that I wasn't vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine", Şahin wrote in a LinkedIn post on Friday.
"For several months now, friends have been pressuring me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counter these false rumors".
He has refused to do so, because the communication should not be about him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He's been battling a severe COVID-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He didn't ask me why.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, often fueled by misinformation and distrust".
Fear is hard to fight with facts, so sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment", Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, priority is given to vaccination.
The prioritization has long since been lifted - and the Biontech chief has, according to his own information, had himself vaccinated three times.
Fire in the power plant: Tens of thousands without power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire which severely damaged a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia were left without electricity for around 24 hours.
The fire knocked out lights for 41,000 affected residents in several communities on Friday evening.
The power company Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power units were in operation on Saturday until the widespread outage was finally completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided assistance in the municipalities.
The authorities offered school-based care places and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are well aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant limitations.
We also thank the municipalities, the district, the fire brigade and the THW for their tireless efforts", said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology Department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The damage will take a few days to repair, as the Westnet-monitors were only able to put some lines back into service temporarily, he explained.
A technical defect, according to the company, caused the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
The fire, which broke out at about 7:15 p.m. on Friday, has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be consulted on the matter.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
This bypass will help restore the power supply.
As of 6pm on Saturday, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had electricity restored.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9.30 p.m.
As of 11:15 p.m., the last affected by the outage had power.
Over 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies were involved.
The authorities had also called for neighborhood aid after setting up emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or lonely people in their neighbourhoods and notify the local fire brigade if help is needed", said Councillor Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The setting up and operation of emergency power units was primarily focused on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for people who are unable to provide for themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
- Good afternoon.
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG #day cover in blue green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
I can't put this on the tabletop.
It is a Custom #NAME#.
There are three explanations.
We wanted the ones with countertops in diameter of #NUMBER#
So we got a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't move them together and shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I'd have to send her back, as she's not fit for purpose.
I'd be happy to hear back.
Yeah, that's really easier!
So here's how we do it.
Will you send me the return note by e-mail?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
Before I bought it, I hadn't started the e-#PRS_ORG# again.
Do I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We don't agree with that.
Nordic combination: combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo was once again beaten by the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the loop with a big lead after ski jumping.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yeah, we both re-designed the S and we're using version 4.5...
You may have heard of the problem before.
I just called my #PRS_ORG, bought a book, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I open it, the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be faulty. Please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection's gone and now?
I have to work in between.
To ensure that the paint job is uniform and clean, clean the parts with a little soapy water from dust, grease, and fingerprints, and rinse and dry them with clear water.
Before applying a new color to the model, it is advisable to practice two to three strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components that you won't see later or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly, line by line.
The slight overlap of the colour layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid quick brushing and wiping.
This creates unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones might shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metallic grains may appear when mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you put them in the oven.
The models are designed to look as they were when they were first made.
From territorial signs on airplanes to ship names to ornamental signs and license plates on car models, the decals give the model its final touch.
Place the decals in the correct order while the components are still within easy reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be easily attached before being fitted into the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools, such as scissors, brushes, and toothpicks, are time, patience, and a steady hand in sticking.
Cut out each decal you need and put it in your place.
Decals are also called water slides because you briefly moisten their backs with water until the carrier paper gets dark through the moisture.
Then, simply slide the picture off the paper and place it in the appropriate spot on the model (which you have also moistened before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, pull the support paper away from the side.
Warning: Always check that the picture is in the right place before you remove it completely from the paper so that it does not stick to your finger, crack, or even tear.
Use a household towel to drain excess water.
Not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look for something else, then I stop reading the book and I have to log out and log in and reload the book and find the place where I've read it.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by e-mail?
For all three packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 separate packages
Okay, thank you.
I'll buy somewhere else as soon as I get the money back.
But will I be able to get it back?
Childcare in cars / What is an "insurance case"?
Hey, everybody,
We've been in child-rearing for a while, and now when it comes to the car bill, it suddenly gets in the way.
In order of appearance:
We had applied for the child wish railway in advance to the car company and got the promise of three tries.
The trials were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the car.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and we did two (unsuccessful) attempts, but they didn't count the car.
We reapplied for the cost of the car and again we were granted three more attempts.
After a few more trials (we have done more trials than promised, logically the most expensive ones are paid by the car), we have submitted the invoices to the car and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3), the car only wants to pay 3 trials.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment are cancelled.
The second child wish was a new insurance case.
The AGB states that "the insurance case starts with the treatment and ends when the need for treatment is no longer there".
The questions to the experts in this round:
* Who is right here, the car (only 3 attempts are refunded) or us (it is 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the car have warned us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts will fail?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The first child does not cure infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes).
It would be great if the experts here would give you their opinion.
Thank you so much for your help.
Can you please email me the three options and tell me how best to get back to them?
- I'll take it from here.
We're not ordering anything from them anymore.
If you add up the revenue from me and my friend #NAME#, they've obviously lost a good customer.
You can pass this on to your manager.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the refund was arranged and now you're telling me that I have to send the thing back.
I can 't help it if the dresser comes to me completely upset .
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote
It's very clear that the refund has been arranged and I still haven't received a refund via #PRS_ORG
You can tell your manager that you've now lost two regulars.
My friend also ordered furniture for our apartment through his account.
We're not doing that anymore.
No, the defect didn't appear until a few months later.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
In any event, the guarantee is valid for 24 months.
No, I can't get any other kind of packaging.
I'll be able to take the cabinet apart and make it available to the transport company.
Good afternoon, I have a question about your series from #PRS_ORG
These products are advertised with additional stools, but unfortunately we cannot find them in your shop.
Can they help?
Topics of the week: Best low-budget films
There is no general definition of what exactly a low-budget film is, with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say about it:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What's the big deal?
And what might you not like at all?
I'm a very good customer of yours, I've already furnished two apartments with your furniture.
I was just asking you the best price for Odelle's gray leather sofa.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
With warm greetings
If there's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up again soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hey , there .
'Half-victory' against Belarus at high cost to the EU
The EU can declare a "half-victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, explained the researcher at the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This stalemate - Belarus is not giving in, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for some time.
The treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
There is apparently an 'increasing normalisation of pushbacks' by individual EU governments.
The EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed to this, and this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens the cohesion of the Union.
"It can't seem to prevail when a Member State is trying to do its own thing", as Poland is currently doing, which doesn't even allow the EU's border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said: "A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult by the reinforcement of the line 'border protection, border protection, border protection'.
Re-attempted border crossing
According to the Polish Border Guard, migrants have again tried to cross Belarus into Poland.
55 migrants were detained on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were stoned by the migrants in the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
By Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already crossed the border.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler of Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU response was pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
'The EU has put its market power on the scales and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh restraints and extraterritorial sanctions.'
Minsk must also take account of internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula One final
Max Verstappen is believed by Mercedes to have committed two infractions during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Abu Dhabi Formula One final, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows are suspecting two breaches in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to an alleged infraction by Max Verstappen in Red Bull in the final safety car phase, when he allegedly overtook the car illegally.
A second objection was lodged against the rating at the end of the race.
Mercedes believes that the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the final lap and had won his first Formula One title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars ahead of him.
I'll check that out.
I 'll talk to the bank and get back to you .
Thanks for the support.
Free entry for members: Europa-Park is hosting the SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa Park, which gives its name to the Europa Park stadium of Sport Club Freiburg, has invited Fantag to join SC Freiburg.
Members and permanent ticket holders of the Breisgau Sports Club as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa Park free of charge on that day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The tram trains lit up that day through the red and white jerseys.
Fox, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop", says the park.
Since the early 1990s, the Bundesliga has been cooperating with the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park showed once again how well the partnership fits.
Seeing the fans enjoying themselves together on the roller coaster is proof of that", says Jürgen Mack, owner of Europa Park.
Why is this number and not the original 1699 ?

I had a huge problem with you when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# dresser.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home"
In the context of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read her latest novel "Daheim" in the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as a presenter.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast, and listens attentively to the nighttime sounds at her door.
I filled out the contact form yesterday to return an item, but I didn't get an email confirmation or anything.
My question is whether my request has been accepted.
Not everyone has time for your crap chat and fake cheap Chinese goods.
Your mistake, which you're fixing, not all of our household.
Contact the woman.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had a chat yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would get an email with a 60 euro coupon, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This e-mail hasn't come through yet.
The package wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not anti-Semitic doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an Afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
You're both gonna admit it.
But colleagues are constantly reproducing some sort of anti-Semitic message.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just leave it completely.
Yeah wow then you're similarly unreserved as colleague.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution is simply completely at a loss.
I'm the reason a god set this whole thing off.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just bullshit.
And that makes you an enemy of science and no longer take it seriously like your colleague
To obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be placed as close to the eye as possible.
The lens system, which is specially designed in the aplanatic-achromatic way, allows you to use the magnifying glass to the edge of the area with virtually no errors in the registers and colours.
Often, magnification is used to mark the lenses.
However, this information is only applicable to precise conditions which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To make the best use of your magnifying glass, please follow the instructions in the ' Technical data' table (see instructions for use in the package).
Light reflections are produced on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including those with impact loops.
An anti-reflective coating reduces these reflections significantly.
When the optimum conditions of use are observed - the magnifying glass is close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Tinned trees in Schönwolde: Women in the Krembz municipality pick out the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has seen many strange situations when selling fir.
One time a man even drove home without his partner because they could not agree.
He plants 2,000 of them every year.
The 56-year-old has been through a lot of strange situations.
He says that's what makes Christmastime always a little bit fun.
What about the coupon?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective shipment and now I'm paying full price for it.
I shall then assess it accordingly.
We do not need to discuss the better dish here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a spinning spit.
And so both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which is far from sounding so delicious.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic cable in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I'm having trouble getting a stable Wi-Fi network up and running right now.
I had a 50 Mb DSL connection before and I used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mb correctly, except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives them.
However, the other DLan module, which transmits the Wifi, no longer receives the full 500, but the further I go in the house with the module, the less it arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the internet on the first floor is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit) with the new fibre optic connection.
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here.
Can someone please explain to me why fiber optics "lose" so much Internet speed over the power line?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to put LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
I would therefore be all the more pleased to hear an answer.
When to change checking account
Whoever thought that the current accounts would be quiet, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to use a variety of tricks to get their customers to confirm past fee increases, the negative interest rate rebates continue to fall.
For example, Deutsche Bank was long regarded as relatively generous with a limit of EUR 100,000.
Now she's cut the allowance in half and even quadrupled the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered to EUR 50 000 for current and investment accounts and EUR 25 000 for daily cash accounts for customers of the Postbank group.
However, in the meantime, these lower exemptions apply to Deutsche Bank as a whole, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
This is not only the case for new contracts but also for 'new individual agreements with existing customers'.
Commerzbank had previously dropped to a limit of EUR 50 000, which is still in force, as was the case with ING Deutschland.
Directbank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the discount rates in two stages, first to EUR 50,000 and now to EUR 25,000.
At least: more than 100 banks now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin even won the right against this regulation.
The banks are already discussing whether institutions should set aside reserves - in case the higher authorities also declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has a whole army of beauty
She's officially on top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a journey through mountains and valleys.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, was named the most influential woman of the year by the U.S. magazine The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the reunion of Friends and the continuation of her series The Morning Show, this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
She's got an army of assistants, stylists, and trainers looking after her looks.
After all, according to Aniston, she's got to treat herself to a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip out of the bag).
That she still flies the hearts of female and male fans alike is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky and still looking for the big love.
And took the baby wish off the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked me that have no idea what's wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Keep hoping that success and fame make you happy.
The end of a career is undignified: Raikkonen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula One was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight tyre touch, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport premier class.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He has 21 Grand Prix victories, 18 pole starts and 103 podium finishes.
Friedrich wins his 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sport
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's mark of 94 wins is the goal of the bobsledder.
"I've calculated that I would have to win nine and a half times per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026", said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two wins in two days at the Winterberg races.
First, on Saturday, he repelled Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, in which he went from third to first.
Then he changed the material setting a bit and went out with a bigger lead on Sunday at 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Hall), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Hall) he established himself ahead of the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier came in third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded", said Friedrich, who also recorded his 22nd win in the series.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in second place this time to fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I'd do it the same way", Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamaica
In the women's singles, Laura Nolte won her third doubles title of the season.
After finishing fourth in the monobobot the day before, she raced to the World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple jump with anchor Deborah Levi.
Mariama Jamanka, two-bobbing Olympic champion from BRC Thuringia, came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked her first podium place that winter, along with her Olympic qualification.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki finished with Leonie Fiebig in third place.
For me, it was super cool, first place on the podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama's taking me.
I'm super happy with the way things are going.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay", said Burghardt, stressing: "It's not just pushing, there's a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a little upset about the not-quite-error drives, but said, "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I didn't get it, so I couldn't redeem it, so I finally asked.
Corona last year had a whole different set of problems and never had time for it.
And now they said it was over, which really upsets me.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare couch.
I want to return it and then order again, as it's currently on sale.
Why is the shipment not starting until March 16th?
There was nothing on your website about that long delivery time.
No, not until I type it, and an extra box comes up with the message
Was taken yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong delivery.
But we still want the shelf module, a new one, undamaged.
And not cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello, my lovely girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe one or the other will do the same...
I'm 24, I'm a full-time student and a dog mom -- except my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's actually one-on-one with my kid.
My boyfriend (we've been together since 6J) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday, and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
I went to see him yesterday because I have emotional needs too and I want to see him and feel him, and we hugged a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower because his hand is covered in bandages from burns.
He's also cold and we're seeing less of each other at the moment (1-2 times a week) which is really bothering me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy just had a stomachache, I cooked for him, and now he's in his cuddly blanket, relaxing a little bit after I've been there with the heat lamp and caressing him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just been gone for a month.
Now we're just gonna have to do some housework, which we'll split up, of course.
But cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD is in good shape now, I'm halfway through therapy and I'm coping.
Not good, but I'm doing fine and almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot of things (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I have not done anything and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy class for which I should prepare at least a little.
And next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is on my calendar and not in my head because there's no room left.
So my week goes like this: just till the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then it's all over again?
Just until my birthday.
Just until the holidays.
Just until the weekend.
Just until...
And that goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental cues, because otherwise I'm gonna get laid.
I feel guilty and "chaotic" but I can't do it otherwise.
Are you guys feeling the same?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I'm truly grateful, I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I'd have survived my KPTBS otherwise.
I think it has something to do with the mental load of women, and so I thought I'd find some comrades in distress here.
I certainly wish you a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today. Unfortunately, it's all different color, plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has a print.
The first shipment was the same color as the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch tables now, I'll get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26.
Two times for the rest.
But it was not confirmed.
Let's say something completely different: I noticed at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that it is just another subject for them, like math or geography.
It was always a little strange to me, perhaps because I was raised as a Christian and I had always believed in some way.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also tell about workmates and fellow students with different attitudes.
I understand the difference between personal and professional, and it makes sense to separate.
There's a curriculum and so on.
But I'd just find it odd to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Culture or something?
I hope this isn't too personal.
Can't you change it or not? Please write in English. I understand that well.
That's a long time ago, I'd give it up.
- It's all right.
I expect a reply in due time, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hey, people.
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a teenage movie.
There are two time axes (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity.
The other is the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely certain).
Since I can't describe it any more in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a plot emerges.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so he can live on his own.
I think the passage is also the burial place of the soldier.
At the end, the two soldiers fight, I believe.
If that's any indication, I'm grateful for any answers.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach since week one.
Fast forward: still alive:D
You need to relax.
A child like that can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything around it is right, no cuddly animals, go in and look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
It's driving you crazy.
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Axso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he's sleeping.
Is it turning its head to the side?
Can it get up from the belly?
Or is it face-first, right in the mattress?
That's how you know everything's okay.
We all grew up, too, and when my husband was born, it was all about putting the kids to bed on their stomachs.
We're also regular customers and have already bought a lot of items.
But why are you offering me only 20 euros?
Hello, I already texted a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no response.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday.
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
I'd like you to contact me as soon as possible.
The closet is unusable at the moment.
Let me get this straight.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this station are now under the radar.
Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but then still go on big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote from Arno: "You don't want to be a running litter box".
What are you now?
An 0815 commercial station trying to get its BilloMerch to the elite fan base.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They can continue to insult people, of course.
A Krogman who lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the blown-up rented rooms.
How can you find all this good?
Great if you like it. I think it's terrible.
I'm calling you back because my wooden table was defective.
Corpus fracture by damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether it's a comforter for a stomachache or just a cuddle, my little warmth buddy is versatile.
Cherry kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for healing applications, as cherry kernels are very good at absorbing heat and can deliver it back in doses.
The removable inner pillow can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft support makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe even when they are not feeling well.
The cherry core cushion with a support is suitable as a heat sink only for the following applications:
Before heating the cushion, check for any unusual odour, stick or burn marks and, if present, dispose of them immediately.
Please remove the inner heating cushion from the frame first.
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (please note the microwave manufacturer's instructions)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking.
Then put the inner cushion back into the support.
The first heating may produce a slight moisture buildup on the surface, but this will disappear with repeated application.
Be sure to follow the warming instructions given, as longer periods or higher energy consumption may cause damage (risk of ignition and combustion).
Before heating the microwave oven, check that heating of cereal products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner pillow has been put back into the cradle, please check the temperature of the pillow at your armrest for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C).
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile conditions, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, or in people with reduced pain sensation.
If you have any skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour problems, or if you are pregnant, please consult your doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are emerging, dispose of the product and loose kernels immediately and out of the reach of children.
If the product is used in infants under 1 year of age, the child' s temperature should be checked regularly during use to avoid overheating.
Any serious incident occurring in relation to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country where the user is established.
The base is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product.
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working from the basement.
Ingolstadt can't do it under the third coach.
Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed truce under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was not charging through my power supply.
I bought this new about five months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone would be enough to run it.
Bad signal, battery's dead and the laptop won't start, even though it's plugged in.
I've added the battery, but nothing happens here.
You got any ideas?
I ordered a new battery, but why can't I use the laptop in the grid?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help.
I want the #PRS_ORG delivered to the room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seating area is...
You're on tour a lot, but you're carrying a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
The 20 litre capacity can easily accommodate larger photographic equipment, which can be securely stowed with the help of the FlexFold padded dividers.
And the rest of your everyday items are well organized and separated from the camera equipment thanks to convenient accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the Update of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design is a metaphor for the industry - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still allowing access to the photographic equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: one is the conventional cover flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch enclosure system, a highly sophisticated solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the Messenger bags.
The flap has a metal flap hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account various "fill levels": there are 4 anchor beams, firmly set, into which the closing hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is full, you just take the top beam, it's more like empty, a deeper one.
The valve cap and hooks are also magnetic.
This also allows the backpack to be securely closed without the hook being snapped.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday backpack from other photo backpacks: in addition to the cover flap, there is a rip-off opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly enhances the everyday suitability of the backpack, as you take along not only your photographic equipment but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and store both easily separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items are safely in the left backpack and do not interfere.
Comfortable, easily adjustable seat belts help with this.
And since the backpack's outer shell is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even when it is scheduled to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I'm waiting in vain for the email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of the

I haven't received a message yet.
I'm asking for immediate action.
I'm already writing to the third support staff, and I've never gotten any further than the promise that I'll get an email as confirmation.
This is the return of the wrong custom #NAME#
Is there any way of knowing when the cabinet might be delivered?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It's working.
Thank you so much for your help.
Have a good evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you renew my voucher, I'll be ready to place a larger order, but I kept the damaged piece of furniture and didn't return it.
And that last year went differently than I expected, I couldn't foresee and I just couldn't settle it and clear it up in time.
But I'm the one who's gonna suffer the damage as a customer, and I'm not gonna accept it.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined (drilled and cut).
All the curved discs are manufactured in short series according to the individual technical characteristics of the particular discs and designs.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing programme is drawn up, which balances the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The curved discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake lumps.
The aesthetic qualities of our tinted windows emphasize the character of each car by its attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks of water on the south fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly, triggering the so-called California Gold Rush of 49.
Thousands came from far and near, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were cleared, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was called Coloma or Bust!
In this game, you're a pioneer looking for wealth in the West and making a name for yourself.
You'll be looking for gold, recruiting labor, gathering horses, and building a business.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your pioneer colleagues to avoid going broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, you have to manage your resources and build a table that works for you more and more.
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to get extra action, or to turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual style of play with subtle adjustments.
Coloma spans a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California became an official state).
A year in Coloma is five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is uncovered and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a blockade!
This will disable half the site - reducing the number of possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as acquiring resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gun heroes.
When all the action is complete, the pioneers will return.
The bidder will rotate to a new location at the start of each round, thus changing the available actions.
This continues until the price tag has moved five times, so it has covered each location once and the year is over.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gun heroes and are outnumbered by the bandits, they receive rewards.
But if they fail, they get lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shot, then the final score.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Media Library
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary popped up on my Twitter timeline today, and I looked it up.
>Pediatric psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest on talk shows and lectures throughout Europe.
His book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I'm very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
We parents and other responsible people must never, never, never have power over the child.
Our aim must always be to give the child room for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as is reasonable and possible in the situation.
I'm still shaking my head.
Holetschek: Countries discussing the abolition of the test requirement for triplets
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide removal of the test requirement for triple vaccines.
"We need clarity quickly on whether and when the testing requirement for three-time vaccinated people can be waived", Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, told Bild am Sonntag.
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination", Holetschek said.
The German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back
What's the best way to do it?
Hi, I like the #PRS_ORG chair very much, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me with that?
I can't shop through my #PRS_ORG anymore.
Oops, there's been an error.
Shopping is done through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I've updated the account details.
What could be the reason?
What you're describing is called "awareness", meaning sensory perception under general anesthesia.
These occur at a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most common is hearing sounds/voices, the rarest is seeing images and the rarest is experiencing pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are surgeries that involve a heightened level of awareness, as they avoid very deep anesthesia to protect the child until the navel is removed.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but by definition, u/Nitemarex had none.
I misread your comment.
The chair is defective.
The 20 euros won't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is standard in e-commerce, as well as being a legal obligation.
Please check again to see if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
We're losing a lot of money, too.
I already sent you an email that you didn't answer.
Let's ask the question again.
The order and the invoice say the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipper is company #NAME#.
I just called them.
I was told they only deliver on the doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG.
Is that right?
If so, I'll have to cancel the order, since I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
I'm not gonna get a call?
I had a question.
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died aged 97
He's made a name for himself as a theater critic and as a director.
Later he wrote a monumental theatrical story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An Old Man Gets Older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the message that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is, "I'm here to testify to my life".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is the European pallet, a standardised wooden pallet used as a load carrier, especially in Europe.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to the data of Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was about 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported into Austria per year is not collected.
New York City takes the MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the title for the first time in Major League Soccer.
After a 1-1 regular season against the Portland Timbers, the Eastern Conference team won the final in the penalty shootout with a score of 4-2.
In the Eastern Conference finals, New York had won against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Roundabout tips and tricks
I got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
They had it at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butter-sweet!
So thanks again for that.
Now I've got a taste for it and I want to cook rouladen for New Year's Eve for the first time.
Tomorrow I'm going to start a cattle fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have a stove, just a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I can handle it.
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed by e-mail on 18 January that the refund had been made.
But to this day, I have not received the money.
Would you check that, please?
Where there are still Christmas pies in the Lübeck room
For many people, the goose or duck is part of the Christmas festivities, as are the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't gotten any chickens yet?
Now we're running out of time.
We'll tell you where you can get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck room.
The drive of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
The VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controllers allow you to set the desired level and the noise level of your sounds.
The VT+ series amplifiers also offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the gain or distortion.
And it was said earlier that you can even use the power level controller to create a power reserve if it's going to be loud.
Power Level controllers enable the full potential of the VT+ series to be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed by a box simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound even when using a headset or when recording live.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX box, allowing you to jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also included - so you don't need a separate voice control.
If you also have a VFS5 foot button, you can easily access the sounds by foot, turn the effects blocks on/off and "tap" the pace of the compatible effects.
This is actually essential for live operations.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I've seen it happen to others.
Is there any way you can send the lamp back?
Because she's too low for a dining table?
So I'd like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
What about the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If I can't, I'd be happy with a discount or a coupon.
I might be able to find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a bit much.
I just got my delivery and I was wondering if screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror on the hooks provided.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
The Iranian authorities have indicated that progress is being made in the negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that are to be on the agenda", Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a 'positive and important development' because at the beginning there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement had resumed after a break of almost a week.
The negotiations will be attended by negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now the federal state with the highest coronavirus incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in the whole of Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was above the 1000 mark in the corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day figure of 1,025 new infections per 100,000 people.
In Saxony, which had always been the highest incidence in the country, the figure on Sunday was 990.5.
On Friday and Saturday the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to infection were reported within a day.
200 seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated in intensive care hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely keeping up with the number of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery is not until the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I'm gonna have to print this and paste it on the package and deliver it to the post office, is that it?
I don't have to click/type/fill anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, so I am writing to you.
I'd like to take care of the return at my own expense.
8 euros return fee is a disgrace in my eyes.
It 's time for a change
I am in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the mail for?
If you look at the activity of the Bundestag in the last few months, you can see one thing: it does not exist.
We've come to a winter's end and extended the summer hole for a few months.
#What's the problem?
Yeah, what was it?
I think that the Commission has a very good reason for not doing this.
In recent days, it has become increasingly apparent that many people here really do not like the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
The question is now to the community around the Bundestag, which wants to keep it alive.
The initiative came from u/edizVEVO, which has become aware of this project in recent days and has found a pile of pieces, to put it simply.
After some correspondence, several people from the community have found themselves willing to rebuild the project.
I would like to ask the Commissioner to give us a clear idea of the situation in the United Kingdom.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can access the server through this link.
Objectives and targets:
* How will the Bundestag function in the future?
* What existing regulations need to be changed/adapted/removed?
* How should we act in the future?
* How to recruit new members?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot a few things, which is not bad, which is what we end up with Discord.
If you have the time and the will, come to Discord, cooperate and let us decide democratically on the future.
I ordered a lampshade for this, which will be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/sticky for that and not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered another hanging for you.
I put it together and noticed it when I took the soft foam.
I'm very sad about that.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also pretty sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the #PRS_ORG day cover, is it also available in oversized, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the defective closet will be picked up in time.
And I'm asking you to do that now.
I don't have the right packaging, but I'll take the closet apart as much as possible for pick-up - you need to talk to #PRS_ORG about how that works.
#PRS_ORG# can always call me to arrange a pickup date.
Is there a manual for assembly?
How long would I have to get it or decide to send it back?
How do you answer the question, "Why are you vegan?"
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself lived a vegetarian life for a while, and now she probably eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before that.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan, and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that was that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and realized that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to go vegan.
I had the impression at the time that she was resentful, that she was defending vegetarianism, that she knew where her meat came from, and that vegetarianism would reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like being a vegan is a quick way to get stuck in a corner and conflict arises that you wouldn't have to deal with.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
It is clear that this is not an exception under Paragraph 312d of the BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I'm on the date assigned when #PRS_ORG# is not picking up my return on site.
Since I can't be there for a funeral, I'm afraid that's not gonna change.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
I'm available on a continuous basis from 01.02.
The Land has provided a grant of 45,000 euros to the Lahnsteiner Wehr for water rescue
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 euros to Mayor Peter Labonte at Lahnstein Town Hall for the new water rescue equipment car of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this", says Peter Labonte, the mayor of Lahnstein.
The equipment car is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They perform water and ice rescue and technical assistance tasks above and below water.
In Lahnstein, the investment is expected to increase permanently: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle and the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure stream contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed her recommendations, but synced, removed and reloaded the app, and it didn't work.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole operation has taken me a lot of time and I'm hoping for help now.
Okay, here's the deal.
I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS_ORG collection for June.
Can I enter an appointment during the ordering process?

Thank you for coming forward, I've also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar capacity, we were also gunmen in the executive, I don't want to go into it any further.
I always find the question of right and left very simplistic.
But in principle, we should say that the civil servant is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it should be clear to everyone that these people can then, of course, deal with the reality of life, because you have, of course, in addition to the average white, meanwhile, many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by this I do not mean the exaggerated feminine clichés, because these are in the executive there are rather fewer to not at all but normal men and women who you do not notice if they do not tell you) and also on these people and I have to rely, because in doubt they save your life or put this for you.
But even these marginal groups, although it may sound strange from my experience, are conservative, proud of Germany and feel less attracted by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy is supposed to be advocating for them or believes it must do them justice, and they simply want to be treated as normal.
Back to the right, because of course the police and the military are also a cross section of society, you will also find extreme right there, but that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that are dangerous to the state is completely exaggerated in the media and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad often start to flatter because of negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It is also true that right-wingers sometimes meet and exchange ideas.
I am not going to go into detail on the subject of the Commission's proposals.
Germany is so deeply involved in the world and that is a good thing, I think, that we cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yeah, which I don't understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side too.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
But I was told in your order confirmation
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG basket for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany or is this basket available anywhere in Germany.
I always find you to be the only partner.
But at the top of the edge of the wood piece are two deep notches that were filled with something yellow
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More orderly by child?
I have been thinking about this for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (self-employed, very little free time), but I have been able to keep my household clean and tidy all my life.
There's always a phase where everything is left, and then, sometimes, it catches me and I clean up and clean up.
But it's never really like, "Someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is not better either, it bothers me somewhere but mostly he loses household just against work and displeasure.
The kitchen is still the most regularly cleaned since we like to cook.
Now, my question is, did you manage to get more organized with the baby?
We have no buts on it and I have been concerned about this question for some time.
Because for me, I don't have any incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much as long as there's no visitors and, for example, there's always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Is having a kid a bigger incentive or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically pre-formed cut, offering maximum comfort, perfect fit and thus allowing almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Preforms with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends)
For Focea Comfort 4, the Flex System 2 has more than doubled the area covered by the Flex system to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and knee bends)
High-quality preforms in the lower back and in the step ensure a perfectly fitted seat.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar spine increases flexibility around the back-spine fastener, thereby improving comfort, especially when bending and mounting and installing equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is located around the shoulders and back, guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a heating, water-repellent material with a special surface structure which provides a high degree of protection against cold.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) face sealing on the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate hood)
The soft zone in the collar improves the sealing with a fine- adjustable width by means of a flexible, gentle clasp that does not stick to the cover or seams
Double cuffs with zippered arms and legs connect a folding inner cuff to a soft, cased neoprene outer cuff
45° at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and loading capacity.
Long neck zipper with elastic reinforcement for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overalls without hood
Long G-Lock P back-splitting latch (overall without hood) with metal slide and incorporated water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Tightening of arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels bonded with an outer and inner layer
The edges of the outer cuffs are lined for greater loading capacity
The edges of the inner cuffs are notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wristband computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a self-doubt personality disorder?
I have been trained in software development and have been out of school for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I'm increasingly realizing that this job is not for me, so I've been thinking for a while about starting over and studying social work.
The problem is, I have an insecure (or fear-avoiding) personality disorder.
That means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have loose conversations and I have been told many times that I seem unapproachable (which I think has improved).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth group, but rather in, say, addiction counseling or family support.
I do not know whether the actual working day is really what I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find anything on the Internet.
The EPPO is already causing problems (for me, emotionally) in my job because it pulls me down every time something is wrong with my code ("it's already screwing up the simplest things") and I find it difficult to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should really know how to do it myself by now"/"I keep him from work with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm under-resourced" etc.).
The problems I'll probably have in any profession but I wish I had mentioned it right away.
You got the couch back, didn't you?
Because there was no confirmation of that.
I'm waiting for a pickup date.
What do you mean , " return , please " ?
When I download a book on #PRS_ORG, the message comes your #PRS_ORG does not authorize this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The bird breaks down the protein (protein) taken in with the feed into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract and builds up its own proteins from these, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in nestlings and the re-formation of feathers in mourning birds are extremely complex processes and involve a particularly high level of stress on the whole organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as this may interfere with the breeding cycle.
Following this short-term administration of NEKTON-bio, the daily vitamin supplement should be switched back to NEKTON-S (a multivitamin) and NEKTON-MSA (a mineral supplement).

1 g NEKTON organic to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
One coated measuring spoon (in the case of a container) is equivalent to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-bio may be given at the beginning until the feather re-formation approach is visible.
The normal dose is then administered until complete feather re-formation.
Storage: NEKTON-bio should be stored dry without sun exposure at 15°C to 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after nine months ?
The guarantee period in Germany is 24 months.
That's really bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and images were attached.
Did you get this e-mail?
Statement by a municipal employee in opposition to the statutes
Hello, this is the German legal service.
I have this problem.
We're going to cut down a walnut tree on our property.
So I filed a complaint with the city.
A coworker writes to me that cutting down fruit trees and thus the walnut is not part of the charter.
However, the statutes explicitly list the walnut as a tree to be protected.
Can I trust the employee's testimony now or not?
On the one hand, I need to be able to rely on expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we'll use the new packaging for that.
I didn 't get any message .
Well, then I still have an unused couch.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
Which ones were more expensive?
Yes, I think so, but the question is, can I pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany?
Can you check that?
Emergency report: serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
According to the press alert of the police, a passing car has come into the opposite traffic.
There are wounded.
Ah, okay, I see.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy.
Advice and ideas for continuing working life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you.
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is just dismembering everything that can be dismembered.
Before I get to the bottom of this, I need advice, and I need advice from people who know my situation, you know.
I'm doing the ref as a cross-input.
I originally studied something else and worked in a field there (to at least remain a little anonymous, I'm not going to say anything more specific here).
But then I got bored with it and I looked for alternatives that might be more fun.
I ended up in the teaching profession and I was sure that it was - even though the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I'm now at the third "I google other job postings"
And it's only been six months.
In the paintings before that, I always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, after that I can still swing.
But I'm absolutely finished.
I've had so little free time this past month that I'm completely exhausted.
It's a holiday, but I still have a lot of work to do.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was also my weekend, and my off-day was my off-day.
I had a day off.
And the stress of work didn't matter in those moments.
Now I'm too stressed out about the family reunion myself.
And then there are these rigid structures that are annoying me even more.
It's fun, basically, and from the outside, the ref is also going well in terms of feedback and stuff.
But I'm completely exhausted, and I wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely closes down -- if it's not already doing that.
I wonder if that's what I want to do for the rest of my working life, especially as I read some of your posts here, or if I should go back to the old field where I was valued, where I could take time off when I needed it, and I found the work kind of boring, but I got paid well for it, and worked together as a team, and not as a lone fighter, as is the case most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I'll be back in the same place in a year and not be satisfied.
You realize it's all kind of messy, but maybe you're an outsider and you have some advice or ideas on how to get me out of this situation, which I'm completely done with and almost crying at the first thought of it.
I'm not gonna make decisions that emotional right now, which probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, which is enough for now.
Thank you for reading and forgive my tearful undertone.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been continuously developed, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly mimics the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are authentic and absolutely impressive.
These amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances bubble forth.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amplification and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modelling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet newly added sound requirements, which led to a further boost in performance of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed to meet the needs of all guitarists looking for maximum variety of sound.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string strokes, and a prompt speech.
During a detailed analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage primarily determines the character of an amplifier tube, and based on this finding, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The valve reactor circuit fitted with a 12AX7 tube of each VT+ amplifier perfectly reflects the behaviour, subtle nuances and sonic character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite Wagner's 20 points, Magic are losing to the Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA is still going.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven counters from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, 104:106.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually positioned and foldable compartment closures, it is tailored to the needs of your camera equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What will fit in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras, such as the various Sony a7 series models or a Fuji X-T2, still leave room for additional lenses.
And there's a lot of stuff to store.
And if you have a small DSLM camera, you can use the backpack for your equipment and for things you don't know.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also an ideal choice for drone pilots, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro with remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows have caused great damage on the Canary Islands.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
Up to now, the eruption of Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, lasting 84 days.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
Although the activity of the as-yet-unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, volcanologists still do not dare to predict when it might end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable", said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state-run RTVE television station.
Losses in millions
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava, which is more than 1,000 degrees Celsius, has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other structures, RTVE reported.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That's the equivalent of almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage was estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, lava has cooled to form two new land masses totaling about 50 hectares.
The banana crop, which is of great importance to the island, and which supports about half of the 85,000 inhabitants, was particularly hard hit and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely damaged, reported the newspaper El País.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is upon us and especially the children will be eager to see the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, coupled with the spiritual atmosphere and the twinkling of an eye, have a certain seductive quality.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still holds our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of gift giving, so that the gesture of gift giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of indigenous peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be revived in the context of this tradition.
How Santa Claus Became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who made Christmas closely associated with the gift giving.
Previously, gifts were handed out in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that St. Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women one night to spare them another life in sin.
This unconventional way of giving gave rise to the popular custom in Germany of filling the boots, especially of children, with gifts.
Protestants have found this custom offensive because they reject mediators between God and men as "saint worship".
For these reasons they are against the institution.
Martin Luther made Nicholas the Christ child, thus establishing a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer view such details so closely, few are upset that the custom of St. Nicholas, like the Martinsong and the Martinsong, is still a regular part of the Christmas season.
Today, everything from socks to luxury watches to the boots at the door and the Christmas tree is what the heart desires.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources attest to a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of the gift was moved to Christmas Eve.
But in all Christian lands there is a happy debate about who brings the presents to the children.
In Germany, whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Nicholas, depends on the region.
These include his white beard, which has little in common with the historical figure's more severe Assyrian beard, his reindeer-drawn sled, and the use of the fireplace to access the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fable creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, Fathers Frost brought it some fame.
It's not reindeer here, but three horses pulling his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for handing out the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
A gunman was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man with a gun entering a bank and a bookmaker's store.
The man fled in a vehicle that officials said was stopped shortly afterwards.
There was a gunshot and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
There are several embassies in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family live there.

Lighting duration not more than 10 hours.
- The robust plastic construction is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it's mostly menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow in color.
Smart stone, on the other hand, is harmless: the sun alone makes this sunlight shine fascinatingly, either in white or in color (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a large natural pebble, this modern light object presents itself in daylight.
Its organic roundings fit into any natural environment  whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and findlings, where it is able to assert itself thanks to its size.
You can save on a lot of preliminary work: As a solar lamp, Smart Stone does not require any power or batteries.
Place the "lamps" in any place where the sun shines during the day.
Two supplied earthenware spits provide a firm grip if needed.
The matte-white plastic casing itself is sturdy and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides the "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs, one for white and the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight hits the housing.
At dusk, the Smart Stone starts to light up automatically; you decide which color to choose: six attractive light colors are available for you to choose from, alongside daylight white.
Finally, the shutdown is also automatic as soon as the battery is reduced to a prescribed minimum or becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the next day the charging cycle starts again.

The Pill Problem
Hello, my dear women,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, after a year Reddit is actually my first post.
My problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, primarily because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and shit PMS before my period.
Now I'd like to leave that alone, because I have chronic diseases that require me to take enough medication that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly, is not the pain, but my skin.
I had gone from zero to 100 explosive pimples in my last two-year break, and these were everywhere.
It was superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of break, it never really got back to normal.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
I'm already using perfume-free and no ginger, but maybe someone can recommend something.
The gynecologist didn't take me seriously, and I'm not going to the dermatologist.
Thank you so much to everyone who read the novel!
Yeah, the skin is so sweet.
Had severe prefrontal neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then extensive nodules and the acne issue.
I have tried everything during my illness and I have been stuck on a diet low in sugar, milk and meat because nothing else has worked so well.
It's okay to be hormonal, but if you're like me, you're in the construction industry, and you don't want to look for anything else that's wrong.
I already had everything your colleague Semina o.ä.
I wrote, and now I've lost the conversation and I don't know what my request was answered.
I'm always working and on the phone and then all of a sudden it's gone...
What's there to check? If the money was there, I would have seen it.
Check my bank records, please. Maybe there was something wrong.
But is it generally available in large
Since it's available in black, it's a big one.

In the name of the people, laypeople make judgments with the people
In the courtroom, they sit on the bench in their regular clothes.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they are not wearing a robe: the authorities decide with professional judges whether and how long a person is behind bars.
Two of them report in an interview with the "Offenbar" from their time at the Bad Kreuznach Regional Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Regional Court on John F. Kennedy Street.

110 kV ground cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The authorization for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The decision of the Lower Bavarian Government to establish the plan clears the way for the construction, which is scheduled to start in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now informed us.
The approximately seven kilometre long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Parish Church.
The cable will be connected to a free-line mast near the village of Edermanning in Reut.
Good morning, this is my wife.
My order of 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts.
The blue betzel number: #PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned from #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
A good start to the week.
You can forget that, I explained it several times yesterday!
This is a glass dresser and the whole sides are cracked, so there's glass everywhere and the box is broken
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG regulations
That means the dresser can't be picked up because no one's allowed in my apartment.
Thanks for the message.
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was EUR #NUMBER#
No, it's in all books, which is why the request at #PRS_ORG#, since it's probably a general problem
Ref: School planning (EC)
I am not going to say that we are not going to have a debate on this.
I've been at Ref since the summer, I enjoy teaching, but I'm still having a lot of trouble planning my geology class in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I can only use the board, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
I can only copy for free at school (which is annoying for geographers).
I just need a lot of time to plan my classes right now.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors, and with me, every hour is a different story.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time in simple lessons (which I need for school-leaving courses, etc.).
I always start with the learning objective (what I want to achieve) and then think about how to build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra, and with most of the problems in the book, I'm rather dissatisfied.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work the book efficiently.
I'd really like to.
I'd like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the #Number# order.
I've actually decided on a new #PRS_ORG #, but I'd like to start the returns as soon as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation on Christmas sales.
Most stores are open only to those who have been vaccinated or recovered.
The trade department considers this unnecessary and regrets the drop in sales.
He has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for retailers, according to the German Trade Association (HDE).
The Commission has also been asked to assess the impact of the new measures on the environment and the environment.
According to a recent survey by HDE of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative view of the rest of the year.
Many would have written off the Christmas business.
"What should be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without a bottom", said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
The only good things are in the food retail and online sector.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe affair, the chief executive said.
"2G shopping will not take us any further in the fight against the pandemic", he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The bands regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once and would have access to all shops on that day with the tape received.
In addition, in retail trade, as in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested), sampling should be sufficient.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas deal.
Frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of pre-corona levels, sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now be in the middle of such an important Christmas business", said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
The high level of staffing and administrative burden has led to efforts to find and obtain approval for the centres.
This includes the so-called band-aid solution, whereby "visitors can, for example, present their 2G certificate at a central point in the centre and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to that of a club hotel - enter all shops without interruption".
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a flaw on the frame which has been tried to be hidden with a yellow filler.
That looks bad.
I'd like to return the mirror, and I've already put it back in the package and glued it on.
How do I proceed with the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour reproduction.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities allows the lamp to adjust its color temperature and brightness.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the colour temperature in the range 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to operate.
The light produces a very bright stream of soft, high-quality light, completely flickering.
The 120-degree radiation angle, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
And by the way, you can also do it in a reporter's situation in small spaces or at short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to work with on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the remote control of the lamp in television studios or when the lamp is mounted in difficult to access places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, which consists of buttons and a light-emitting display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
The NP-F battery slot is also located there (not included in the package)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To make the settings of the individual settings on the storage sites, simply pressing one of the storage keys for a longer time is done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that when switched on again the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work, e.g. when the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120's battery-operated functionality is its ability to operate with low-cost NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check the battery capacity before the set - there is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two displays (the left battery top display, the right one on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlamp with continuous power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm case for attachment, so you can attach it directly to your photo stand.
The inclination must be reliably adjusted by means of detectors on both sides.
Care has been taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, an inclined joint is included in the package.
It's great that a bag is included in the package.
This will allow you to transport or store the lamp and any other accessories you may wish to purchase without any problems.
Too bad I got it as a gift and it's too small.
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, Hessen, who had won the last two series, were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga title.
But then the SGE turned on, within a good hour of getting the frustration of a full-blown start to the season out of the way and winning furios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys did today", coach Oliver Glasner cheered on DAZN and said a "passive praise, to each individual who was involved".
At first, it looked like a new cushion for Frankfurt, which now ranks ninth and still lacks expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusen team 2-0.
What happened next impressed the SGE trainer too.
"How the players came back and put on a fantastic performance", Glasner continued.
I am very happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to get back on the field for the first time since the fourth day of play and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big", said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the audience.
That's the party we were planning to throw today.
For the tasks ahead, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also sees himself well placed in terms of the personnel situation.
It's extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are in top physical shape.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players live very professionally, too.
Now, we want to "go on, step by step, and remain humble" and carry out the tasks "at this level" until the turn of the year.
The next game is scheduled for Wednesday, the English week, at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m. Sky).
I'm getting the e-mail that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG and getting it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again, or do I have to wait for the money to be returned and place the order again?
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to order again because it's been a long time.
Have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG chairs?
Dampers for women's handball ahead of the quarterfinals against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slips from the court with their heads hanging and their eyes empty after the humiliation against Denmark.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB team suffered a crushing defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent", said national coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
That was a bad game of all, which we have to erase", said Captain Emily Bölk.
The fight for the semi-finals against the 2019 World Cup runners-up on Tuesday will need to be intensified to keep the dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German shooter in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back-row player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in defence", back-up Xenia Smits admitted, urging: "We have to look forward quickly now".
From front to back not at the height
Unlike the previous five tournaments, the German team was not on the level with the whistle.
Misfires and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operational temperature and prevented worse with a few parades.
The first goal came to the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
However, this was not the initial ignition hoped for.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danish women, the German women could hardly put themselves on stage - and if they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavians.
The game was early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backup Mia Zschocke saw red a little later due to a hard foul on her opponent.
But she'll be back in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into play a little better and approached at least five goals until the break.
The already small hope of a catch-up after the change was already there at seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Groener defenders have sinned in every area, making it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal contenders in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer catch up to a performance increase and left the floor as a clear loser.

The title says I'm a vaccination doctor working in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is primarily administered in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be largely finished, some of the work will then be carried on in vaccination centres for me.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not personally relevant (e.g. "I take medicine X, does it go with the vaccination"...).
My areas of responsibility include vaccination education, indicative status (a person is entitled to a vaccination according to the coronavirus vaccination regulation and no reasons to oppose it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (this has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical staff.
In the case of vaccination teams, we often have no, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, who cannot (may?), however, carry out vaccinations, so I myself carry out most of the vaccinations.
The problem is that the European Parliament has not yet decided on the future of the European Union.
What is a "skin-picking"?
This dialect word, sent by an Ambergman, has been used in the BR television programme "We in Bavaria" to provide for intense reflection.
But unlike many days before, the term "Host mi?" was not used by callers.
No, it wasn't "a man who's nervous".
And no one who has to go fast.
That, people heard from the TV host, was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg gave the answer, and this probably surprised many upper-class farmers.
"The leather man", the onlookers learned, "is a rag that someone uses to wipe the stove".
Dialectologist Antony Rowley, an expert interviewed by Bavarian TV for years, confirmed this.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to adopt a decision on the proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs.
This has closed a gap in education, probably also for many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always comes: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#s, connected them to the PC, synced and repaired them.
Nothing has helped.
Tire selection on a racing bike - really that safe?
This morning I woke up full of action, because I wanted to exercise a little more in preparation for my bike ride next week.
Said, done, and I was off on my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what happens in every city centre (this time: thanks Krefeld!)
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, loud squeaking, and my rear tire wouldn't go the rest of the way.
Since I had no real way of getting a spare coat and a spare hose because of the weekday, I had to turn around in a half-bad mood and take the first train home.
I'm not so bad in terms of hair, but maybe it's better if I do the tyre change before the bike ride.
Now I'm faced with a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey ahead of me, I would be extremely uncomfortable having this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because the old tires of the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike until 14:00 he tore off 120km!) and who had already called these as suboptimal, because he had been riding with them for several years.
But when I think about the fact that I have to change my tyre after driving 80 or 90 km, I think I'm really in a bad mood.
Now I met an elderly man at the platform who asked me in amazement why I did not have the Marathon Plus tires, which are said to be priceless.
Now, of course, this sounds very tempting.
But are these really so unbreakable?
I don't feel like spending 40 euros a tire just to be disappointed.
I'm wondering, I'm on a racing bike right now, I think it's 25x622.
There are also (apparently?) in the Marathon Plus tires, but most are already wider.
Is that a problem?
Or would you advise me to change tyres for a racing bike?
The Swallow page seems to me the absolute!
Thank you in advance for your help and greetings.
Car crashes into tree, driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten into a mid-island for unknown reasons and then hit the opposite track, police said.
There, a head-on collision occurred with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown into a tree and the man was trapped inside the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also be reborn.
The new SOLO 15 is called the new sprout and is visually similar to the large prototypes with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this design includes a suitable foot directly to lift the speaker into the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length to suit the conditions at home.
The SOLO 15 is, in principle, very suitable for persons who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound, but where the maximum volume is a minor factor.
A 10-cm speaker simply cannot produce such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
That doesn't mean SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears to be quite mature and, for its size, extremely impressive and precise.
Tonal tuning of the SOLO 15 with a slight pitch increase.
This is common in broadband to optimise the high frequency bundling.
The SOLO 15 is designed to be heard precisely at the listening location, and it is very clear and subtle.
When slightly turned outwards, the high-pitched range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
The point source makes it possible to pinpoint the individual components of a piece of music in the optimum stereo triangle with blade-sharp precision.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100-6 OHM, which are considered to be the benchmark, provide an enemy dynamic similar to its own.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to consider the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning in order to plan appropriate changes during construction.
If, for example, the case is to be fitted, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the liner is to be applied again.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), an 8 mm hole should first be drilled into the floor plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to carry the cable through there later without any problems.
A top mill now follows the speaker opening in the front so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
This opening should be fitted with a 45° phase at the rear to maximize the opening area of the speaker chassis inside.
The four bolt points of the B 100-6 OHM are interrupted in the phase as shown in the figure Detail Phase.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back, the lid, the front and the floor are then polished.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, e.g. if you want to use finished bars from the market rather than making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
The next step is to attach the second page.
Then there are all the plates of the foot, so the two sides, and the front.
A suitable hole-circuit saw or a Forstner drill facilitates the attachment of the openings of the bass reflector tube and the connecting clamp on the back wall.
Then a round grinder is used to round all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate may also be rounded.
The base plate is then securely glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
The next step is to mark and drill (2,5 mm drill) the bolt points of the speaker chassis and the connecting clamp.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction/blown out), start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflector opening in the back wall.
The entire uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot to the terminal opening and left there to stand out for about 30 cm.
At the top of the case, the cable is connected to the speaker opening and is also loosely suspended.
The frequency switch is then prepared and used.
The design of the frequency switches and the corresponding connection plan can be obtained from the following document:
If the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet fully closed, is then sealed.
The 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening, and with a little skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and close it.
The B 100-6 OHM can be opened and the sealing can be checked with a small lamp.
Now, the damping is as described.
The B 100-6 OHM is then connected and screwed with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus wire (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflector tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For the purpose of damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
> Hello to all,
> we can finally announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for reasons we know, we are unable to get more than four people in the studio, which has meant a higher amount of planning and explains the short notice.
BUT: There will be at least three people in a row, so we'll be watching the Oscars 2021 with at least seven beans streaming and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic, but we're going to do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Get some cold drinks, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
