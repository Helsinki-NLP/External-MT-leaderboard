From January 1 to March 15, 2020, the overall incidence rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was increasing rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area.
The overall incidence rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, demonstrating that the global COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries, despite varying levels of prevalence.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase preparedness in anticipation of a dramatic increase in healthcare and especially the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the agent was a novel coronavirus, also known as severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence so far suggests that 80% of COVID-19 patients have moderate disease, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most recover.
In 14% of cancer cases, COVID-19 progresses to more severe stages requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop severe illness requiring intensive medical supervision.
4% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 died.
In this study, we assess the overall incidence trend of COVID-19 in each EU/European Economic Area country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to the Hubei Province of China.
We have compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/European Economic Area countries and the UK with the number of cases in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
COVID-19 has spread from China to more geographic regions, and the COVID-19 outbreak is currently spreading across the world.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
Spiteri et al. in Eurosurveillance 2020, published on 5 March, reported the first European confirmed cases of COVID-19 according to WHO case definitions.
In the European Union/European Economic Area, France reported the first three confirmed cases on January 24, 2020, and the people came from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases have been reported in all 30 countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between December 31, 2020 and that date, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Knowing the total number of COVID-19 cases and overall incidence
The COVID-19 case numbers reported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in each country in the world are only available from official sources such as the country's health ministries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess and compare COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with Italy.
As the presence of active COVID-19 cases is a factor, we have evaluated COVID-19 cases for a 14-day overall event, taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
In addition, we have compared the number of reported cases in each country as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 2020 with the situation in Italy from January 31-March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend in COVID-19 cases in the EU/European Economic Area countries and the UK over the 14-day overall incidence period was followed by Hubei Province (China) as a whole (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the overall incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February and then peaked around 28 February/2020 (Help Material).
This was largely due to the rapid increase in reported cases from Italy, however, other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown similar increasing trends in the total COVID-19 incidence (Helpful material).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom compared to the number in Italy from January 31-March 15, 2020.
As of 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/European Economic Area countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results show that the number of reported COVID-19 cases has increased rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK.
Trends in the overall COVID-19 phenomenon suggest that the global pandemic is increasing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is happening at different stages in countries, with differences in national public health responses, and perhaps different case definitions and different protocols in different countries to select patients to be tested for COVID-19.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian provinces reported that 10% of COVID-19 patients were in need of intensive care, and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these provinces were at capacity.
Currently, data on COVID-19 cases being treated in hospitals and/or intensive care units is available for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively at the EU/EEA level (data will not be displayed).
however, they must be collected in a systematic manner to strengthen up-to-date surveillance data focusing on reported cases and deaths.
A 201011 study found that there was a wide gap between ready-made intensive care beds and standard beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal per 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people, in 2010/11).
The estimated number of COVID-19 cases in hostels in each EU/EEA country and the UK is based on the sixth ECDC update of Rapid COVID-19 Assessment.
Since there are also group cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units often serve a specific segment of the population, data on cases and intensive care beds should be disclosed at the NUTS-2 level.
Experience from Italy and other trends in other countries show that the global COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the fact that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to spread in the community and the number of healthcare, especially COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care, will increase, as exemplified by the situation in the regions of Italy affected by the virus.
As highlighted in a recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid and comprehensive approach to slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2 is critical, shifting from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in case numbers if not implemented early will not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt to their response.
Rapid risk assessment limits public health measures, which are intended to mitigate the impact of the global pandemic.
The window for countries to further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare is short.
Otherwise, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will be overwhelmed with patients in need of medical attention in the coming days or weeks.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and the rest of the world, killing more than 3,000, making it a pandemic for humanity.
Similar to the same virus that caused SARS in 2003 in thousands of people, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by bats and causes similar symptoms.
However, although COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, its prevalence rate is higher, affecting older people more than younger people and men more than women.
With the rapidly increasing number of articles published on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive review of a rapidly growing research project.
We cover basic issues related to epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the disease.
although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this scan will help us understand and prevent this potentially fatal disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, was a memorable one for all Chinese, as Chinese were warned not to leave their homes during and after the festival due to the new virus outbreak.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (Cov) that caused severe respiratory syndrome in 2003, so on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2, and the related disease COVID-19.
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country, reaching nearly 50 countries worldwide.
As of March 2, 2020, the number of reported cases of COVID-19 virus has exceeded 80,000, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospital, and more than 3,000 deaths.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the number one public enemy and has the potential to cause more harm than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report was published on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, epidemiology, and treatment, which have sequenced viruses isolated from different patients.
This survey attempts to summarize the results of the research in a new and rapidly changing topic of study.
As much as possible, we try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another COVID-borne disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a 2012 outbreak).
we discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and the history of the disease, as well as some remaining but urgent questions.
CoVs are generally considered non-lethal pathogens in humans, and are the leading cause of about 15% of influenza 4.
However, we have seen two cases of disease-causing giant CoVs (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) in this century; first in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and then quickly spreading to several other countries with alarming rates of illness and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third recorded CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1, cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
The covid patient was released seven days later.
January 15, 2020, the first death was recorded in the water.
meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, isolated countries and countries.
On January 20, health care providers reported cases of the virus, indicating that the virus was transmitted from person to person.
On january 23, all public transportation in wuhan was halted and the entire city was closed.
A preliminary clinical study of the disease on January 24 showed that of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with a Wuhan seafood market, where an unknown animal source was thought to be the source of the infection.
On 30 January, WHO declared the pandemic an urgent global health threat.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread to China and nearly 50 other countries (Figure (Figure2.2).
"As the situation changes rapidly, the final extent and severity of the epidemic may be yet to be determined".
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study was conducted on 8,866 patients, of whom 4,021 were confirmed COVID-19 patients with recent infection status (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but mainly those aged 30-65.
Half of the infected individuals (47.7%) are over 50 years old, very few are under 20 years old, and only 14 infected people are under 10 years old.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases (0.31/100,000) is higher among men than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was mainly spread in and around Hubei.
It takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis to be diagnosed.
Symptoms begin to appear in an average of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days in an infected person.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13).
The baseline fertility rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases of the virus increased significantly before 23 January 2020, the transit period for the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of broad-spectrum, single-stranded RNA viruses.
They can be divided into four general categories: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta CoVs are known to infect humans.
Envelope spike (S) glycoproteins bind to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then form a tissue fusion.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is digested, the genomic RNA and envelope glucoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins form an outer or inner cell with the virus, which binds to the plasma tissue and releases the virus.
The first pre-series comparison of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
When SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new variant of beta-CoV, more than 99.98% genetic similarity was found among 10 samples taken from the Hunan seafood market in the waters where the outbreak first occurred.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar in its genome to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been detected in the thinnest parts of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been found to be receptive to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein in SARS-CoV-2 has weakened its binding to human ACE2 from SARS-CoV, which is related to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is encoded by the novel short protein orf3b and is secreted by the orf8 protein.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in the disease-causing potential of the virus and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known active domain or inducer.
On February 18, 2020, Xu and colleagues reported that the full-length cryoEM structure of human ACE2 is 2.9 Å resolution, which is a complex of the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
Open and closed assays have shown that the complex can be reassembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may be a potential target for a drug-eluting stent to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of the home and distributor
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in bats and were transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and camels, respectively.
By comparing the genome of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were thought to be the original hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus had a 96% similarity to two SARS-like CoVs from bats, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate carrier that allowed the virus to cross genetic lines and infect humans is still unknown, and the transmission pathway is still being explored.
G and colleagues suggest that snakes transmit the virus from bats to humans, which requires recombination with S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, long-nosed, ant-eating pangolins, mammals commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, are intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on 99% genetic similarity between the CoV found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference in the distribution of both genomes is itself a significant difference, and therefore, concrete results for concrete evidence are awaited (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still not widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and for up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and humidity between 40% and 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and temperature at 56 °C to 30 °C. Ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated antibacterial agents, paracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, excluding chlorhexidine, can effectively degrade the virus.
The general population is vulnerable to the new virus because of the weakness of the SARS-CoV-2 immune system.
At present, there are no detailed studies reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other co-occurring diseases, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4).4).
In general, a virus is first identified after it has invaded the host by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are active in the host's immune system, including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
The virus uses a variety of pathways to cause inflammation of the body, the maturation of antigen-presenting cells, the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), and to slow the spread of the virus, thereby accelerating viral antigen macrophage phagocytosis.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein may help the virus escape the immune system.
Soon, a targeted immune response will join the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play a vital role in the fight against the disease.
CD4+ T cells activate B cells to produce antibodies to the virus, while CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the immune system.
However, CoVs can interfere with T cell function by accelerating T cell death.
Fluid-derived immunity, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also important in preventing viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovering patient rendered MERS-CoV inoperable.
On the other hand, when the immune system overreacts, it releases large amounts of free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, disabling various organs, leading to death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to affect older adults and pregnant women with various diseases.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune systems are weakened to be more likely to contract the virus than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with a study of the first 425 cases in water generally 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, the most recent study showed that the reproductive period of the virus is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on demographic data of 8,866 cases.
It will be critical for health authorities to adjust effective quarantine times based on the most accurate breeding time, which will prevent people who are infected but not showing symptoms from spreading the virus to others.
As a general rule, individuals exposed to or infected with the virus are usually required to stay in isolation for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The primary and early symptom of COVID-19 is fever, which may be unobserved or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, blistering, headache, sore throat, chest pain, nausea and vomiting.
some patients have had shortness of breath and/or low blood oxygen levels since the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients may develop severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy early on.
Patients with symptoms of fever and/or respiratory illness and severe fever should be screened for the virus in advance, even if they have no problems with lung imaging.
According to a demographic survey conducted at the end of December 2019, the percentage of patients who were diagnosed with the disease was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respirator support.
Similar findings have been reported in recent studies of two family groups and a group infected with the virus from a non-symptomatic individual.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic survey found that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of COVID-19 patients require a respirator more often, considering that MERS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms, and 14%-20% of patients required respiratory assistance.
On February 14, the COVID-19 death rate was 2%, while the global number of confirmed cases reached 66,576.
In comparison, the death rate from SARS as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
According to the demographic survey for merce, june 2012, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to the initial study, the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was high at 6.47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, and the R0 of SARS-CoV was 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV based on symptoms, mortality and R0 are presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal than the two.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is more challenging than controlling MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Group infections often occur within the same family or group or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually had a history of travel or residence to Wuhan or other areas affected by the virus within the two weeks prior to the outbreak, or had direct contact with individuals or patients with the virus.
However, reports that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing symptoms and that patients who have recovered from hospital can carry the virus again are a warning to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages of the disease, patients have a normal or low white blood cell count (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count; 4×109/L; including lymphocyte count; 1×109/L; elevated levels of aspartate aminostranfer and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
In some patients, blood levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were elevated in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin-reducing product in the blood, increased and the number of immune white blood cells gradually decreased.
In most COVID-19 patients, chest X-ray results showed a health problem characterized by swelling on both sides or cloudy areas in the lungs.
patients often have a normal pulmonary embolism, severe lung damage, and severe respiratory distress syndrome (arsd).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled swelling, fluid retention, and a growing wound cause severe gas exchange problems.
Type-I and type-II alveolar cells reduce lipid and protein synthesis, which increases stress, causes the lungs to become loose and increases the risk of lung blockage.
Therefore, the worst chest radiography findings are often associated with the worst case of the disease.
An analysis of the first case study on COVID-19 on February 18, 2020, showed damage to pneumocytes, formation of hyaline tissue, lung tissue entering the lungs and the presence of cells from the lungs of infected patients, consistent with the viral infection and ARDS disease studies and similar to those in SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a laboratory technique called reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has served as a critical test for COVID-19 disease.
However, due to the increasing number of false-negative results, which could accelerate the outbreak, clinical screening (no longer relying solely on RT-PCR) was introduced in China on February 13, 2020.
a similar situation occurred with the identification of sars.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical demonstrations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is critical to effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang Group developed a protocol for detecting SARS-CoV-2 using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per milliliter input) using a dipstick in less than an hour without the need for additional equipment.
We hope that if the new technique can be proven in clinical samples, it can significantly improve sensitivity and comfort.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel CoV, doctors can provide primarily supportive care for COVID-19, while also testing other CoVs and various therapies that have previously been used or intended to treat other viral diseases, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Table (Table2).2).
these include antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, patient plasma, chinese medicine, and psychotherapy.
plasma from recovered patients was proposed for use in treatment.
pharmaceutical companies are rushing to produce antibodies to the virus and vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks primarily the lungs, with smaller amounts affecting other organs that produce ACE2, such as the digestive system and kidneys.
however, respiratory failure and stroke remain the leading risk factors and leading causes of death.
respiratory support is therefore essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, inert and inert ventilation, and mechanical ventilation, such as a weighted breathing tube.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be assisted with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and maintaining the function of critical organs are critical for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine storms are known to be caused by an overactive immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a systematic response to anti-inflammatory activity, characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytotoxins cause the disease-modifying cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which cause ARDS and various organ failure.
immunosuppression cytokine storms are critical to the treatment of severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tosilzumab, anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytotoxicity.
Other treatments for cytokine storm include stimulation of a targeted T-cell immune response; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; bleinatumab; cytokine signaling inhibitor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
steroids are widely used to treat sarcoma to reduce damage to the immune system.
However, high doses of steroids are of little help in alleviating severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
rather, it can severely affect prognosis, leading to serious side effects, especially bone tissue death.
However, short-term administration of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids is recommended for COVID-19 stable patients.
At the time of writing, there is no effective antiviral therapy.
However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, given intravenously has been effective in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally intended to treat infections caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir was shown to inhibit the activity of single RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Accordingly, Gilead has delivered the compound to China for combined testing on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, with the results eagerly awaited.
in addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are proposed for use as therapeutics in patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur as a result of lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction between these treatments and other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibody production from recovered patients
blood transfusions from people who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat similarly ill or to prevent infection in otherwise healthy individuals have a long history.
of course, recovered patients have higher levels of antibodies than the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes that fight pathogens and other foreign substances, as well as directly neutralize specific molecules in pathogens.
Accordingly, plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients was collected and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral load, as well as improved oxygenation of the blood.
however, until specific therapies are developed, confirmation and illumination are needed to suggest a method for widespread use.
In addition, some risks associated with plasma should be carefully considered in view of its potential for reducing illness.
for example, antibodies can suppress the immune response and cause life-threatening cytokine-receptor syndrome, a toxic condition.
blood antibody levels are often low, and the demand for plasma to treat severe patients is high.
It is difficult to quickly develop and produce specific antibodies that are capable of fighting a global pandemic.
therefore, it is necessary to isolate b cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes needed to produce effective antibodies or to filter out the critical proteins of the virus to make effective antibodies.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases.
However, the effects are largely based on the combination of different components in a formula, which varies according to the TCM treatment.
most of the active components remained unknown or ambiguous, because such components or their combinations were difficult to identify and verify.
Currently, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from the disease due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du pills and Lian Hua Qing Wen pills have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
In several provinces in China, where TCM was used in 87% of their patients, the recovery rate for COVID-19 patients was high, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%).
However, this comparison is not thorough, since many other influential factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) therapy alone with combined WM and TCM therapy.
The time to recovery, symptom resolution, and hospital admission were significantly reduced in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM-only group.
Most surprisingly, the rate of exacerbation of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%); the mortality rate was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM will be subject to a larger scale and more controlled trial in more centers.
It may also be of great interest to describe the complexity of the steps and the effective components of TCM treatments, or if possible, their combinations.
patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are more likely to be afraid of the highly contagious and possibly fatal disease, and those in isolation feel more isolated, lonely and angry.
In addition, adverse reactions to infections and treatments, such as fever, shortness of breath, and cough, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased mental illness and depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a variety of mental health disorders were reported, including persistent seizures, confusion, panic attacks, schizophrenia, psychiatric symptoms, dizziness and suicidal thoughts.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, one of the public health responses to preventing the COVID-19 outbreak, can cause people to feel anxious and guilty about the pandemic, the effects of quarantine and the isolation of their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and those in contact with them and generally in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, the clear and accurate transmission of regular and up-to-date information about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid contact.
In addition to being critical in breaking the chain of transmission from animal colonies and infected individuals to vulnerable hosts, effective vaccines are a complement to antiviral therapy to control outbreaks caused by new viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines that can sustain antibodies and/or boost the immune system in the face of SARS-CoV.
Vaccines made from disease-causing viruses have been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the elderly and their mortality-reducing models and the effectiveness of the animal-borne virus must be determined before clinical trials begin.
This may be because sars declined 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, measles cases in the middle east region continue to expand rapidly, spreading from animals to humans in existing areas to other regions.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using inert viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like materials and laboratory-derived protein fragments, some of which have been tested on animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for Sars-CoV-2 protection for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, due to the long time needed to produce a vaccine (an average of 18 months) and the volatile nature of CoVs, dealing with the problem is challenging.
Since COVID-19 is a novel disease, the full clinical process is just beginning to be demonstrated in thousands of patients.
in most cases, patients recover gradually without deterioration.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 causes high morbidity and mortality among those who are seriously ill.
Therefore, building a predictive model for the disease is critical to help health care agencies keep their services organized, especially in resource-poor areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following issues may be related to or affect the medical history of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33)):
Age: Age has been crucial in determining the history of SARS, and the same is true for COVID-19.
As mentioned above, according to a study of 8,866 cases, 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age with COVID-19 occurred mainly in the 30-65 age group.
The fact that patients requiring intensive care are older (average age 66 versus 51) than those with pre-existing conditions and health problems suggests that age is a determining factor for COVID-19 patients to estimate their chances of recovery.
Gender: As noted above, SARS-CoV-2 is more common in males (0.31/100,000 males, 0.27/100,000 females).
Chronic health problems and illnesses: COVID-19 patients who require intensive medical care are more likely to develop severe heart disease and respiratory problems.
Heart-related complications are the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be linked to ACE2-positive collagenic cells and may cause liver health problems in COVID-19 patients.
it is important to recognize that age and preexisting disease are closely linked and can interfere with each other.
Unhealthy laboratory findings: Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are indicative of the extent of inflammation or tissue damage, and are proposed to be used to determine the natural history of disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The relationship between CRP levels and predictions of COVID-19 severity and growth status has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may help predict the outcome.
these enzymes are highly expressed in various parts of the body, especially in the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
therefore, heart or liver health problems are common indicators.
The main clinical symptoms: chest radiography and the duration of clinical symptoms should be seen alongside other factors to predict COVID-19 outcomes and health problems.
use of steroids: as mentioned above, steroids are commonly used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce damage to the respiratory system and to suppress the immune system.
The widespread use of high doses of corticosteroids in severe SARS patients has led to bone cell death, permanent disability, and lower quality of life in many survivors.
Therefore, steroids should be used in low doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients if necessary.
Depression: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients experience high levels of anxiety and uncertainty due to prolonged isolation, the death of a close family member and other patients.
counseling and ongoing support are essential to help these patients recover from their stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, COVID-19 has different transmission characteristics than SARS.
In addition to multiplying in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates in the upper respiratory tract and shows no signs or symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the flu.
Therefore, people infected with the virus may produce large amounts of the virus during the early stages or during the incubation period due to their daily activities, making it very difficult to control the outbreak.
However, SARS-CoV has been shown to be transmitted when patients are severely ill and most transmission does not occur in the early stages of the disease.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Major efforts are underway to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in China, including a complete ban on movement in Wuhan and surrounding cities and quarantine of the general population.
While these measures are seriously affecting the economy and other sectors of the country, the decline in the number of new cases is a sign of a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most conservative estimate is that the epidemic will end in march and the rate of transmission will decrease in 3-4 months.
some other experts, however, are not so astute.
According to Paul Hunter's prediction, COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
and Ira Longini developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in samples taken from the nostrils and throat of patients who recovered from hospital two weeks ago, suggesting that the recently identified virus could be as recurrent as the flu.
However, there are promising signs in china as new cases are declining, suggesting that current strategies may not be effective.
Ebola was initially estimated to cause up to a million cases and half a million deaths.
however, due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease is under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be either weak and progressive, or it can be a weak virus that lives with humans and causes disease.
A comparison between the COVID-19 pandemic and SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted through sneezing or coughing, as well as through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
the virus was also found in the diarrhea, suggesting that it is possible to transmit from diarrhea to mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases found that 41% of cases were likely caused by a local infection, including 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 health care providers.
therefore, extreme precautions must be taken to protect people, especially health care workers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and those who have had contact with patients or people with the disease.
The first line of defense we can use to reduce the risk of infection is to use face masks; surgical masks and N95 respirators (model 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent droplets from an infected person from traveling through the air or sticking to the surface of the material to prevent transmission to others.
However, only N95 (No. 1860s) masks can prevent the virus from entering the body at 10 to 80 nm; only 5% of microorganisms can be fully inhaled; SARS-CoV-2 is somewhat similar to SARS-CoV, both at approximately 85 nm.
Because five surgical masks can be stacked and small objects can get in, healthcare workers who have direct contact with patients should not wear N95 (model 1860s) and surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers must wear self-contained gowns to minimize contact with the virus.
viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor wearing an N95 mask was infected with SARS-CoV-2, possibly through a blown eye.
Therefore, healthcare providers should wear face coverings or masks that are clearly visible when working with patients.
For the general population living in infected or potentially infected areas, everyone is advised to wash their hands with soap and water more often than usual, stay in isolation and limit contact with people who may be at risk of the virus.
people should keep a distance of three feet from each other.
these measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a novel virus for the human world, its strong similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have been a major wake-up call due to China's heavy memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control has been holding out until January 19, 2020, to reassure the public that the new virus has low human-to-human transmission and limited reproductive potential, and that it is not difficult to prevent and control the disease.
This message has significantly raised the public's awareness level, especially as the entire country is preparing for the Spring Festival, and has also provided a critical time to control the disease while it is still at a low level in the water.
disease control organizations in china can learn from this hard lesson and make strong reforms in the future.
For example, these agencies should be more careful when making public statements, as (1) citizens value every word and can change their opinions and decisions; (2) they should be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) they should be more restrictive in preventing an outbreak from happening at the earliest, rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) they should spend more time on targeted and effective training activities that increase public awareness of epidemics and improve community response systems to timely assessments and responses.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, began in late December 2019.
in less than two months, it was distributed throughout china and in some 50 countries as this article was being written.
The COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense that SARS will reoccur, as the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are critical to controlling the outbreak and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more often than younger people, and men more often than women, and the prevalence and mortality rates are higher among older people than younger people.
The death rate from SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even if they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill, making the spread of COVID-19 more difficult to control than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread more rapidly and widely than SARS-CoV.
A standard RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who survive may also become positive for the virus again.
These findings significantly increase the risk of virus transmission.
As research on COVID-19 progresses rapidly, several critical issues need to be addressed, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-CoVs from bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What species of animal was the first to transmit the virus from a bats to humans?
without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot effectively stop the spread, and the epidemic can erupt at any time.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be related to ACE2 by molecular modeling and biochemical testing, how does the virus enter the airway cells and cause disease?
Does the virus bind to ACE2 receptors in other parts of the body?
without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long does the epidemic last?
How does the virus show its genetic growth when it is transmitted from person to person?
will it be a global pandemic, like SARS, or will it be a flu season?
it is important to find answers to these and many other questions, but it may take time.
However, no matter the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
The origin of the human coronaviruses
mutation and adaptation have been the origin of the coronavirus and its carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Before 2003, two human HCoVs were found to cause mild illness such as the flu.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has shown that HCoV infection is both devastating and life-threatening.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought the covid-19 virus back into focus and surprised us with its high transmissibility, but its pathogenicity is lower compared to its SARS-CoV counterpart.
Since HCoV is a zoonotic disease, understanding the animal origins of HCoV is very useful.
Many HCoVs originated from bats and are not pathogenic.
Some HCVs are also known as intermediate primary carriers.
The identification of vector animals is directly related to human immunity.
Studying interactions between animals and carriers of COVID-19 may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in humans.
In this review, we provide a summary of the information about the seven hkov, the history of their discovery, and the information available, focusing on the main origins and the transmission of the virus.
Importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from virus origin to genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 outbreak is discussed in this context.
In addition, the criteria for successful carrier exchanges and virological implications on disease severity were also suggested.
The coronavirus is classified as a group of viruses called coronaviruses, a group that includes both positive and single RNA viruses.
These viruses have the largest genome of RNA viruses, 26 to 32 kilobases, and were named by Zhukovchuk because their structure resembles a crown under an electron microscope.
In structure, stage cochlea has genomes that share the same unstructured structure.
Approximately two-thirds of the virus strains contain two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into multiple proteins that are duplicated into pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are processed continuously to form 16 non-structural proteins, the distinct nsp1~16.
The remaining class consists of ORFs with spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleotide (N) added to the protein structure.
Several variants of protein seeds are also recorded in different Kovitz seeds.
Depending on the differences in protein sequence, covas are divided into four subtypes (alpha-cov, beta-cov, gamma-cov and delta-cov); the beta-cov genus contains many H-covas, and is divided into five subgenera (A, B, C and D).
Genetic evidence suggests that bats and mice are the source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, the covid repeatedly crossed the line of succession. Some also became a major cause of human disease.
There are seven known human infectious viruses (HCVs).
Among these are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, which are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as flu and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the more recent variant SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary symptoms in a moderate number of patients, followed by infection in the lower respiratory tract.
B814, the first HCoV-229E specimen, was isolated from nasal fluid from influenza patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, there have been many studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the idea that the infection caused by the HCoV is generally harmless until the SARS outbreak is detected is widely accepted.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was the deadliest in recent history. It affected more than 8,000 people, with 10% recovering.
A decade later, the Middle East respiratory disease (MERS) epidemic has repeatedly spread across the Arab world and quickly spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), also renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disease series, which has infected more than 91,000 people and killed more than 3,120 people as of March 3, 2020.
The world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as the alarm bells are ringing.
all seven echkoff are from nightbirds, mice, or pets.
Most evidence supports the origins of all HCoVs in bats, which are a highly adaptable and disease-free environment, but show significant genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the world.
studying the source of the coves provides a thematic insight into natural history, the pressures behind it, and the factors that limit the spread of species.
This may lead to or facilitate the search for primary, intermediate and breeding animals of SARS-CoV-2 with important suggestions in preventing future transmission.
In this survey, we provide an overview of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission, and the causes of Echkovitz disease.
In particular, the related HCoVs, which we will discuss and highlight, weaken the more they are transmitted in their natural habitat, but become pathogenic after transmission to a new carrier.
We also examine the evolutionary tendency of HCoVs, where increased responsibility often comes with reduced pathogenicity.
The impact of the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 was also discussed in this context.
animal cows have been known since the late 1930's.
Before the HCoV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from the nostrils of influenza patients, different strains of HCoVs were identified from a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
seven hkovs have been discovered in the last decade.
The idea of the story of the discovery of echkovich is clearly presented in the following order (table 1).
The first strain of HCoV-229E, an upper respiratory infection, was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients in 1966, and then grown in the WI-38 lung cell lines.
Fever and cough, including headache, sneezing, nausea and sore throat, have been reported in 10 to 20% of patients with HCoV-229E and flu-like symptoms.
Later in 1967, the spread of HCoV-OC43 was isolated in a series of cells in the anatomy and brains of a mammal mouse.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 disease are similar to those of HCoV-229E infections, which cannot be distinguished from other respiratory diseases such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses by their symptomatic levels.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and are widely distributed during the coldest winter months.
The time to symptoms of both viruses is generally less than a week, followed by two weeks of pain.
According to a study on volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild cold.
patients with very weak immune systems are diagnosed with severe lower respiratory disease.
SARS, also known as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, is the first HCoV-caused outbreak in human history and the third HCoV identified as the etiological cause of SARS-CoV.
The first SARS case was reported in the Guangdong province of China in late 2002, according to European colonial records.
The SARS outbreak has spread to many countries and continents, causing 8,096 deaths and 774 injuries.
Each case, except for the fast-spreading cases, is estimated to be responsible for an increase in the number of cases in the early stages, which is 4 to 7 days of viral load surges on the 10th day after infection.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially have symptoms of myalgia, headache, fever, tightness and chills, while shortness of breath, diarrhea and respiratory distress are late symptoms.
Lymphopenia (low blood levels of lymphocytes), impaired liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase (an enzyme that is released from damaged muscle) are common laboratory abnormalities that cause SARS.
alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
On average, 20-30% of patients require special treatment and respirators.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, various organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, can be affected by this critical condition, which is often dangerous and exacerbated by cytopione storm, especially in patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus first appeared in a relative of the patient who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong for a separate lung operation.
Since then, much effort has been devoted to the research of echkov.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
first, it is widely reported in children, adults, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Nasal discharge, itching of the eyes, fever and bronchitis are common for diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another single study identified the same virus in a sample taken from the nasal passages of an 8-month-old baby in the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
it is only known in the netherlands, but it has spread throughout the world.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with peak incidence in winter, autumn and early September.
HCoV-NL63: associated with a throat infection also known as croup.
That same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old patient who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and throat disease, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of severe asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide to cause mild respiratory illness.
All of these community-distributed HCoVs were designed to work well in humans, and generally have a low chance of causing highly pathogenic diseases, although for unknown reasons, they carry risks such as infectious HCoV-NL63 subtypes, which have recently been reported to cause lower respiratory tract infections in China.
In general, these HCoVs have the potential to be highly transmissible and persistently self-transmitting among humans, becoming less lethal or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia in a 60-year-old lung patient whose disease had progressed to pneumonia and renal failure.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases have come from the Middle East, recent cases of secondary transmission in close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
The second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 people arrested.
the results of the tests show that merce is similar to sars, with its progression into a progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also developed acute renal failure, making MERS the most distinctive of the HCoV-related diseases so far.
more than 30% of patients suffer from gastrointestinal diseases, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, with a 34.4% high mortality rate, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses for children.
In mid-to-late December 2019, a large number of pneumonia cases were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in frontal contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to the World Health Organization, the disease, named COVID-19, has attracted urgent global attention due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a 3.4% mortality rate.
In Hubei, China, the death rate is 4.2%, and outside of that, 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes a dangerous respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which manifests itself in the form of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
diarrhea has also been reported in some patients.
pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms of the disease and can quickly lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very close due to their 82% high nucleotide sequence similarity, they are classified under different branches on the tree of their genetic relationship.
SARS-CoV-2 is a less pathogenic but highly infectious agent compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, likely contributing to the rapid spread of the disease worldwide.
Comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveals significant similarities and differences.
initially, the development and duration of hCoVs are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 mimics the characteristics of the other six HCoVs.
The severity or severity of COVID-19 disease is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs found in humans (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has the most common characteristics, including unpredictable, mild, or no symptoms during community-acquired infections.
On the other hand, COVID-19 persistent illness is similar to SARS-CoV, although the proportions vary somewhat.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 shows dramatic patterns of behavior in community-infected HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCV in the community.
On the other hand, it has not yet been proven that SARS-CoV-2 decreases its transmissibility after human exposure, as has been the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2, similar to other HCoVs, can be detected in a semen sample.
While SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in facial oral transmission, as with SARS-CoV cases, it should be clarified in future studies, at least in certain circumstances.
There is a strong interest in seeing if SARS-CoV-2 has the same mutant characteristics as the HCoV cases that have been circulating in the community.
However, SARS-CoV-2 has a significant impact on the final stages of the spread of COVID-19, including transmission, pathogenesis, and continuing transmission after transmission to humans.
All four community-acquired HCoVs, which cause mild symptoms, are well adapted to humans.
on the other hand, it may be true that humans are well adapted to these four hyenas.
In other words, both early global outbreaks of HCoVs could be contagious.
people with severe chronic hepatitis and severe chronic hepatitis have been excluded.
To achieve this, hCoVs are stored in targeted exchanges that counteract the causes of limiting the amount of carrier in humans.
In this case, the chances of a full adaptation to humans are higher when the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts longer and affects more people.
if it is well adapted, it may be difficult to isolate infection or prevent other disease control measures.
For several years, four community-transmitted COVID-19 cases have been reported frequently in the Suwannee population, causing the common cold in those with resistance to the disease.
these viruses do not require a primary host animal.
In contrast, the major disease-causing agents, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are less adaptable to humans and cannot be stopped from transmitting from person to person.
The pathogen must persist and reproduce in its carriers and seek out the possibility of transmission to suspected human victims, especially through one or another intermediate and reproductive carrier.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-derived HCoVs.
At least for now, the HCoV is highly contagious, as it is spread in the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
it remains to be seen whether it will adapt fully to humans and whether it will be able to transmit to humans as a carrier or a vector animal.
Before we discuss the origins of echinoderms, it is helpful to discuss the evolutionary, natural, and connective and helper hosts definitions and characteristics of echinoderms.
If the vertebrae share a high nucleotide sequence with the ancestors, the animal serves as a carrier of E. k. o. v. evolution.
The virus is highly integrated and not widely transmitted.
Similarly, a carrier carrier holds the HCove continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and carry the HCoV or parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoVs are introduced into the host and transmitters in a new form before or in the infected area, they do not mix well with the new host and are often the cause of disease.
This carrier can be used as a zoonotic source for human infection and may play a role in making the virus spread faster, spreading from person to person to increase the rate of human infection.
unless transmission is moderated in this temporary carrier, khkov may continue to be a disease that destroys the world's population.
On the contrary, HCoVs can also adapt to their moderate spread and cause long-term epidemics.
This is when the intermediate carrier becomes the natural storage carrier.
Epidemiological data showed a history of contact with animals in contact with the main case of SARS.
The study also found that animal strains are more similar to anti-SARS-CoV IgG than the general population.
January (Pygma larva) and raccoon dogs were first found in wildlife markets with viruses very similar to SARS-CoV, which resembles SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS was recorded after all the toothpicks were removed from the market.
However, before contact with the outdoor animal market or exhibits, cats were reported to be free of SARS-CoV, citing that cats are intermediate carriers and not naturally carriers of SARS-CoV.
It is impossible to separate the spread and exacerbation of SARS-CoV from the spread and exacerbation of SARS-CoV by different mammal species, especially since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibiotics.
These are non-transmissible carriers of SARS-CoV.
Genetic evidence suggests that bats and mice are the source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
These bats have been shown to have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequences.
This and other bat cows share 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence mapping with SARS-CoV.
these studies have laid the groundwork for a new theory about pathogens in bats.
Although several SARS-like covid-19 (SL-CoV) have been found in bats, none have been isolated as a living virus except for one category, WIV1.
Human angiotensin receptor 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 was defined as a receiving bat, a test specimen from a glandular bat, and a human ACE2 to use.
surprisingly, sars patients are not able to inject wiv1.
WIV1 is the closest known strain of SARS-CoV found in bats, with 95% of its nucleotide formula homologous.
Although there is a significant homological difference between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct origin virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the direct carriers of SARS-CoV.
The study of the virus strain brings MERS-CoV together in the same group as bat-CoV-HKU4 and bat-CoV-HKU5.
Both bats COVID-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same receptor-transmitter, peptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA-based RNA polymerase of MERS-CoV sequence is inherited from the B-CoVs, and has been reported in Europe and Africa.
No live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats so far.
MERS-CoV and its close relative Bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of nucleotide sequences.
Therefore, bats may be a direct carrier of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arabian camels have a different immune system to MERS-CoV, which is similar to camels in many African countries.
The difference between live MERS-CoV and the nasal fluid of Arabian camels, which is similar to the virus found in humans, is that camels are actually carriers and transmitters of MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that camels that were tested for MERS-CoV in laboratory research were generally found to have mild symptoms but high viral load.
the virus is transmitted not only by the respiratory tract, but also by the excretion of the sputum, which is the main route of transmission by bats.
However, the source of the disease has so far been questioned because it was not detected in camels before the disease was detected, and it is thought that transmission from person to person or unknown species and unknown animal origin is the cause of MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of the nucleotide sequence with the bat cov RTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 sequences are so distant that it is difficult to estimate their relationship.
This means that bats may not be nearby carriers of SARS-CoV-2 unless similar covas are found in the future.
It is likely that the animals that carried and transmitted SARS-CoV-2 were sold and killed in a Hunan seafood supermarket, and many of the original COVID-19 cases are related, suggesting that it was probably transmitted from animals to humans.
Recent studies on metagenomic sequencing suggest that a low-risk mammal known as the pangolin (Manis gavanaca) may be a carrier of ancient beta-CoVs that have been linked to SARS-CoV-2.
These novel pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% of the nucleotide formula with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are very similar to ARTG13 in their nucleotide sequence by 90% of the way.
In the pathogen category, SARS-CoV-2-like viruses are grouped under two subtypes, one of which shares a high similarity to the endpoint receptor (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 with a 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
Although the genome sequence is wider than previously imaged, in contrast to the clearer, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs are more diverse.
A previous study on infected pangolins found viral contagion in lung samples, which was found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used a variety of assembly methods and manual preparation to create a genome precursor that covers 86.3% of the entire length of the viral genome.
We cannot deny that pangolins may be a transmitter of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 directly originated from Pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also less than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoVs of Pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals continues to be persistent.
However, a high homology sequence was found within RBDs, and the beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 mixtures linked to SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin SARS-CoV-2 share a high genome-wide sequence imaging.
The high degree of similarity between the pangolin SARS-CoV-2 linked RBDs (resistance peak receptors) of beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by a differently selected deep-linked mutation.
The counter-proposal looked at the recombination between the pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wildlife actor.
The fusion is widely distributed between beta-covas as a transformation force.
The decision is based on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Alongside the most common cause of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, the presence of HCoV-1 is being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from the Leptovirus Wave covid, and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 family viruses have been found in mice.
A bat covid called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge covid) found in a North American trichomonas has shown close similarities to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was linked to another bat cov found in Ghana, known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, and camels were also considered intermediate carriers.
For clarity, our understanding of echinoderms as animals is clearly summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Paleogenetic analysis has provided evidence of historical incidents of transmission of HCoVs to the Internet.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 was transmitted from domestic animals to humans, a respiratory disease outbreak was recorded.
The transmission of HCoV-229E between species is not well understood.
Bat alpha-CoVs that are closely related to HCoV-229E have been identified.
Among them is alpaca alpha-cov.
Several sources of information support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
first, humans, not alpacas (long-necked, furry animals from south america), may have contact with bats within a shared ecosystem.
instead, humans have little to no contact with alpacas.
Second, bat-alpha-coves that were linked to HCoV-229E were isolated and not pathogenic in bats, while alpaca-alpha-coves caused outbreaks of respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, we should not stop speculating that alpacas may have contracted HCoV-229E-linked alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that are harmful to humans, including mad dog virus, ebola virus, nipah virus, and hendra virus.
it is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit hcov-229in directly to humans.
Alternatively, bats can carry the virus to humans, as can MERS-CoV, alpacas and Arabian camels, while alpha-covids can be used as a HCoV-229E gene pool.
MERS-CoV is a good example of a communicable disease, since it is transmitted from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The origin of MERS-CoV was first identified in nocturnal birds, and has been reinforced by a series of discoveries.
It is clear that bats exchange and transmit genes for genetic division, creating multiple sets of viral agents.
Long stays, large gatherings, close contact and the ability of bats to fly strongly are all favorable conditions for the spread of the virus.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been infecting camels for decades.
It is well suited for these camels, which have been transformed from medium to permanent and natural storage carriers.
MERS-CoV causes mild disease but retains low mutation in these animals.
It is a rare human disease and is rare, and unless the spread is stopped, people will remain a high-risk carrier of MERS-CoV.
The share of camels in MERS-CoV transmission is unique compared to the share of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
especially pangolin beta-covas are a major health hazard among pangolins.
They may be the final transmitters for beta-CoVs that come into contact with SARS-CoV-2, as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Many possibilities of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans with interacting agents need to be discussed in future studies and then controlled by external studies.
Initially, bats may be carriers of a virus that is related to SARS-CoV-2 and similar to SARS-CoV-2.
human children may share the same ecological zone with a few bats by feeding animals or mining coal.
Second, the virus is associated with the fast-transmitting carriers of pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, which are newly infected.
humans contract the virus when hunting and eating wildlife.
Many mammals, including pets, may be at risk for SARS-CoV-2.
Domestic and wildlife testing for antibodies is permitted.
Third, as noted above, the SARS-CoV-2 re-integration and adaptation process may have occurred in another third species that came into contact with bats and pangolins.
The search for an animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Unlike other animal vectors, the three main causes on the virus side are critical to facilitate covid across the cell boundary.
First, the highest relative strength is measured in RNA replicates.
Compared to other single-coupled RNA viruses, the estimated covid transfer rate can be classified from moderate to high, with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 replacements per year, based on the level of covid adaptation for novel carriers.
Cows have confirmation-reading exorbolism, the loss of which leads to extreme behavioral changes and a loss of consciousness or ability to continue.
Interestingly, remdesivir's nucleotide analogues are known to suppress the replication of COV by maintaining this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents being studied in clinical trials.
However, the reproductive capacity of the cows is a million times greater than that of their carriers.
in addition, the rate of mutation of cochlea is usually high when it is not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high transmission rate: the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly low, indicating a higher adaptation rate to humans.
perhaps he was already familiar with another carrier that was close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also affects MERS-CoV, which is adapted to camels with one-horned coati.
Humanly, genetic drift vaccines and antivirals are not as effective against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA genome in cows releases more plasticity in the genome transformation through mutation and recombination, increasing the chance of co-evolution for the interspecies, and facilitating the emergence of the novel coronavirus when conditions are right.
This is supported by a number of specific explicit reading frames and protein functions that are encoded at the 3′ end of the genome.
"Third, the coveted RNA can replicate and change itself in a sudden and repeated manner through a special ""copy-selection"" mechanism".
In the carrier that serves as the catalyst, mutations occur frequently during the transcription of cov RNA.
Subgenomic RNAs of substantially the same full length and subgenomic RNAs can reassemble to form new coves.
Natural recombination phylogenetic malabsorption was detected in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in batCoV-HKU9 of the bat bat bat bats.
In the case of contagion, the virus is transmitted by contact with a vector.
In addition to the three viral factors listed above, the interaction with the virus is the other important and influential factor in the transmission of the disease from the host species.
The SARS-CoV re-association was taken as an example, which showed evidence of positive selection during intragenetic events.
Based on comparative analysis, the single between humans and the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV, virus, has rapid adaptation to different carriers, especially in S-protein RBD exchanges.
RBD, which is generally found in the cov S protein, binds to a cellular receptor and is a widely selective antibody response inhibitor.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD is located in the S1 region of the 318th to 510th amino acid, which is where human ACE2 binds to the viral entry receptor.
SARS-CoV RBD (resistance peak receptor) has the ability to identify ACE2 receptors from specific animals, including bats, bats, mice, and raccoon dogs, allowing the virus to be transmitted by rodents.
Also, 6 amino acid residues have been identified from human and mouse virus isolates and 4 of those are in the receptor-binding domain of ACE2 receptor exchange.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479 and S487T exchanges in the RBD (adjuvant peak receptor) and has increased the binding of the linking protein in the human ACC2 receptor.
in other words, these two amino acid converters may be critical for the virus to spread to humans.
The fact that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by the same cells as SARS-CoV is of great interest.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV can be caused by the S protein of the S1 unit, which is shown to bind tightly to its ACE2 counterpart.
In fact, the cryo-EM study suggests that this patch has a 10 to 20 times higher affinity than between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is necessary to determine whether or not any other primary receptor is needed for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 binds to ACE2 but with another S-body.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptide A for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
After being transferred from the infected animals, they played a significant role in the successful adaptation of these coccids to humans.
In addition to cellular receptors, the effect of transmission in the HCoV species is influenced by other carrier-dependent and other factors.
The separation of these carrier proteins between humans and their natural primary carriers, such as bats, unicorns, and long-faced mice, may limit the transmission of the pathogen.
For successful cross-species transmission, echinoderms must locate host dependence issues and overcome host restrictions.
They are the ones who determine, differentiate and characterize the molecules around the viral carrier linkage, which is crucial in this regard.
Using CRISPR, a state-of-the-art technology, may be useful in the screening of the genetic-wide and limiting causes of the non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 carrier dependence.
Novel Hchkovich's Ascent: Back to the Roots
The diversity of bats creates a high chance of occurrence of novel covas.
In this case, bat cows serve as the genetic collection of echinoderms.
rapid mutation and genetic recombination also serve as two steps in the process, determining the course of HCoV.
for example, the identification of novel protein cells has the potential to alter the virus's state.
Among SARS-CoV utility proteins, ORF8 has been found to be important in human adaptation, which is why it has been isolated from SARS-CoV-related bats, but has been found to introduce different ORF8 proteins.
The disappearance of SARS-CoV-29-nucleotide characteristics was detected in isolated efforts during the early stages of the human outbreak.
This deletion causes the ORF8 to split into ORF8a and ORF8b, creating an adaptive reproductive pathway.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a historical relationship with ALPHA and Gamma-CoVs.
Re-integration sites have also been observed in nsp9, most nsp10, and nsp14 cells.
Similarly, the outbreak of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia was marked by a series of recombination events among single-celled organisms.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs reassemble their shapeless genes with other animal HCoVs.
Human-induced infections, especially in the form of strong immune system, can cause unexpected mutations in the virus strain, which can be caused by selective pressure from the virus isolation.
One example of such damage is the reduction of the full length of ORF4 by HCoV-229E prototype stress, which means the loss of two nucleotides.
ORP4 has been identified in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, and has shown an introduction of alpaca alpha-CoV single nucleotide due to a mutation in the envelope.
Finally, the evolution of novel HCVs is also driven by selective pressure in storage carriers.
bats are not affected by the cloves, but only by small signs, indicating the harmony between bats and cloves.
bats have been shown to be biologically and physically adapted to covid.
for example, the silent night bird is less likely to show symptoms of the disease before the onset of the disease, which reduces the incidence of cooties.
On the other hand, the major marker of histocompatibility in the nightingale is the low level of the NKG2/CD94 receptor, which inhibits the upper end of the cell, which is a stressor to the activity of the naturally-occurring killer cells.
In addition, the increased metabolic activity of released reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bats can stress the reproduction of cochlea or impair exoribonuclease re-reading, thus making it a significant pathogen for the selective pressure for virus generation when infected with a host.
Additional pathogenic covid strains can also grow by fusion, leading to the discovery of new proteins or protein precursors to adapt to the carrier.
So it is no coincidence that the three Novel Hchkovs occurred in the last two decades.
CoVs are not as disease-free or mildly symptomatic in their primary carriers as bats and camels.
They also starve without a strong immune response.
The mystery of why asymptomatic carriers appear and cause severe cases of human infection continues to unravel.
severe symptoms occur primarily when there is an overproduction of cytokines in areas of high alertness and strong immune response, which exacerbate lung damage.
In contrast, the immune response in symptom carriers was reduced by a factor of COV.
A similar strategy to release the resistance response ligand may have beneficial effects for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
interferon response is stronger in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the initiation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is absent in nocturnal birds.
In this hypothesis, the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor can be used to treat COVID-19 from the MCC950 gene.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is generally followed by the outbreak of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Beta-CoVs are found to contain SARS-CoV and share 95% of nucleotide sequence, while SARS-CoV-2 is found to contain SARS-CoV and share 96% of nucleotide sequence.
But rats and other animals in the marketplace have been found to have a virus similar to SARS-CoV, and the closest transmitters of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs were found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may be closely related to the carrier or that pangolin beta-CoVs may ultimately absorb SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence to support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally engineered.
Covid has returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of HCoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the origins of HCoV pathogenesis and the importance of animal vectors in human transmission.
There is strong evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans by intermediate carriers.
the SARS-CoV outbreak would have stopped if markets had been closed and the farmers killed because of human and mosquito contact in the marketplace.
Similarly, given the presence of several strains of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.
However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other animals may be a matter for future research.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been in the body of a camel for a long time.
these camels are used for transportation, meat, milk, wool and leather products for the local community.
They are widely distributed from the middle east to africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to prevent MERS, as was done at the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the recurrent outbreak of MERS, a holistic approach is needed that, along with other infection control measures, will help to find effective vaccines against MERS-CoV, which infects camels.
because we cannot eliminate these viruses, new strains can emerge that can cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic colds are moving into the wild.
especially the disease-causing bats, the kows, are unique.
These zoonotic covens have a high chance of mutating and recombining into new covens that are highly infectious and/or fatal to children in the future.
in some parts of china, the use of wild animals for food should be banned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Given the risks of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, high preparedness and full response to early treatment are needed.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a very long time.
they remain in their natural environment until conditions are favorable for dispersal.
although bats have many opportunities to transmit viruses, people who are taught to stay away from them will have less contact with bats and other wildlife.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is important to better understand the ecology of cows and their natural carriers, which proves its importance in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
to summarize: the most effective way for people to prevent the origin of viral agents is to avoid the ecological source of the naturally occurring pathogenic viruses.
Many small details are highlighted in the SARS-CoV-2 origin hypothesis.
If bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins through sperm, it is necessary to study what the bats and pangolins have in common.
second, if bats play a more direct role in human-to-human transmission of the virus, it is necessary to know how humans can be infected with bats.
third, if a third mammal is a true transmitter, it must be made clear how it communicates with other species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, both infection monitoring and research should be done as many mammals, including pets, may be at risk for SARS-CoV-2.
bats, pangolins, or other animals are expected to be natural carriers of SARS-CoV-2 or related viruses and similar.
Ongoing research in this area will explain the evolutionary course of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with suggestions for preventing and controlling COVID-19 in humans.
It is important to update the testing requirements for suspected and unconfirmed cases of COVID-19.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and this guide provides our experience and provides a good reference for the global fight against this epidemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our knowledge and awareness are gradually increasing with ongoing research findings and clinical practice, and therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies continue to be updated.
In this letter, we respond to our comments on our guidelines and provide the new diagnostic criteria in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) in the new diagnostic test and treatment guidelines issued by the Public Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was renamed severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 disease, our team prepared a quick recommendation guide and published it online on February 06, 2020 in Military Medical Research.
Since its publication, it has received much attention.
However, keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge are gradually increasing based on current research findings and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually being improved.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) had a total of seven editions between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, with some significant changes in context.
Now our guide has received feedback from them, who have suggested a simplified outcome assessment based on their clinical experience.
Their work provides new evidence for our guidance and provides valuable value to the pandemic worldwide.
we support and express our gratitude for this vital work.
However, their work also needs to be updated in light of the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version of the test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 32020), a suspected case must meet three clinical epidemiological history profiles, unless it is clear that two clinical profiles need to include two items to perform a comprehensive diagnosis or to confirm that:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel history or residence history with reported COVID-19 cases in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other COVID-19 cases within 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (including alumic acid testing); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other COVID-19-related communities prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) confirmed cases within 2 weeks from a small group of confirmed cases (i.e. home, office, school/home, etc.); and (4) confirmed cases within 2 weeks from a small group of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases) in areas such as home, office, school/home, etc.).
Clinical profiles: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with the primary visual characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count with normal, reduced, or decreased lymphocyte counts during the first stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on the following suspected case: (1) a real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2, (2) a viral genome sequence that shows high affinity for the novel coronavirus known; (3) a serum test for specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 that is positive in a mouse test, or a change from a SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody negative to positive, or more than 4 times the recovery rate over a severe period.
Real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory organs or blood samples is available for viewing in the second (January 182020) and third (January 222020) editions.
The blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issues of Diagnostic Testing.
These adjustments, based on the researchers' ongoing work, are a good nucleic acid detector for rapid testing, as well as for adding samples from various respiratory organs, including blood samples, and producing a specific antibody positive result in a verified test.
in addition, there is increasing evidence that patients with and without symptoms should be cautious.
Therefore, the table of procedures of Zhou et al. should be revised, as people without clinical symptoms are classified as low risk.
The result system must also be verified in clinical trials and studies.
in conclusion, we invite readers to comment on the direct evidence.
We recommend that people who have unconfirmed cases and unconfirmed claims investigate, follow and obey the new guidelines of their home countries.
our team regularly updates our help guidelines.
Bangladesh reports the highest five new deaths of the day due to COVID-19
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest death toll from the virus in a single day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported 114 cases of the disease, including 114 under treatment and 33 recovered.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news summary, Dr. Mirjaddiye Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, said that four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to dr merjaday, two patients are over 60 years old, two are between 51 and 60 and one is between 41 and 50.
he also said that two of the robbers were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization declared CIDID-19 as a pandemic.
Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was under observation at Kuwait Maitree Hospital, was among the dead, hospital officials told local news agency Anadolu.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport would be closed until next Saturday, longer than originally planned.
This closure of public transportation initially began on March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
transportation of essential goods -- medical, fuel, and food -- was still allowed.
The first reported case of COVID-19 disease was in Bangladesh on 8 March, involving two men and the wife of one of them who had returned from Italy.
As of march 19, all three have already recovered.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases worldwide has exceeded one million
The total number of cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus worldwide passed one million on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 deaths have been linked to coronavirus.
Zambia has recorded its first coronavirus-related death in the same year that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus case.
North Korea has declared itself one of the few countries free of coronavirus as of Thursday.
The World Health Organization announced yesterday that a total of 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases, were reported in the twenty-four hours after the 10 p.m. on April 4 at Central European Time (0800 UTC).
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the United States, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported that more than 1,000 people died in the United States from coronavirus infection on Wednesday, citing data from Johns Hopkins University.
countries around the world have announced that they have taken strict measures to control the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's curfew until May 1.
nationwide, president Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will continue to receive pay without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted 215 in favour, 10 against and 1 abstention to extend the national emergency for 15 days.
Saudi Arabia has extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to a full day, previously only between 3pm and 6am.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew of 10 pm and 4 pm.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the state's curfew until May 1.
Stores in Australia have lowered the limit on toilet paper for one sale
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian supermarket chains Wellworth and Coles lowered the sales limits to two and one pack per sale of toilet paper in all stores nationwide.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit on Monday.
These restrictions were posted on links to financial directories and Facebook pages.
Consumers reportedly stockpiled goods due to fears of COVID-19 and possible quarantine.
On Wednesday, Woolworths unpackaged a package of toilet paper/software purchases to take home.
These changes follow the previous four-package per-exchange restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles said in a press release on March 8 that many stores are still selling out within an hour of shipments, and demand is "unprecedented", ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, sales increased significantly last week.
Costco stores in Canberra last week reduced the allowable size to two packages.
To better reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries; Woolworths ordered more ready-to-sell items, and ALDI arranged special pre-scheduled sales for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Retailers Association, says retailers want to boost sales, but local council restrictions on truck-delivery times have made it difficult.
He expects production costs to fall as suppliers and others wait to distribute the different phyla.
ALDI announced on Monday that some warehouses will not hold a special Wednesday after the stock was released early.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said stores were filling up with items for sale every night.
Toilet paper/soap is a larger item, which makes it available in smaller quantities in stores and, when sold, creates a wide open shelf space, creating a sense of scarcity.
"according to abc, "colles and woolworths' idea is that if you have more items on the shelf, you can reduce the amount of dust that can be created by buying too much sanitiser and towels", says russell singham.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper said on Wednesday that its stock was running out.
Kimberly-Clark, Connex Toilet Soft, and Solaris Paper, which operates a garbage collection, said they were working 24/7 to support supplies, according to News.com.au.
Real estate website Domain.com reported that some property sellers in Melbourne are offering free toilet paper/software to the first bidder at auction, as few auctions will take place as buyers are on holiday during the long week of Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, published daily by Darwin, included an eight-page insert for copying and use as toilet paper.
The warehouses were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, saying they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases, according to a report from ABC Australia on 3 March.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry cleaning products, hand washers and powders.
Similarly, the British online okado supermarket outside Australia announced on Sunday that it will only sell 12 capsules of Andres's Playa.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of COVID-19 now a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
The term "Pan-African" does not refer to the severity of a specific case, but to the extent to which the disease has spread, indicating the urgent action taken by the U.N. governments:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic".
"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, said that ""if countries test, treat, isolate, search, and respond to the population""".
"We are concerned about the seriousness of the disease and are keen to see appropriate action taken.
"According to former US director of disease control and prevention, Dr. Tom Frieden, the pandemic is described as ""unprecedented"".
"In a February CNN commentary, he said, ""there has been no respiratory virus other than influenza from the outbreak to the next global outbreak"".
"Gera Jesus ""expressed the same view that we have not seen an epidemic like the coronavirus""".
"And we have never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time before", he said.
The new situation follows a decision by the World Health Organization to declare a public health emergency for the spread of a global pandemic.
Dr. Anthony Fusey, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the disease is becoming more severe because it has become so deeply ingrained in the community.
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, and more than 4,600 deaths as a result.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing outbreak of the 2019 (COVID-19) coronavirus, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was declared a global public health emergency in Wuhan, China, on 30 January 2019, and was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries, causing an estimated 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it is estimated at 13.04% in Algeria and .08% in New Zealand.
fever, cough, and shortness of breath are the main symptoms.
complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but this can range from two to fourteen days.
there is no known vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended precautions include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping a safe distance from others, and self-monitoring and self-isolation for people who think they are infected.
Authorities around the world have responded with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls, and closures of facilities.
The pandemic has caused severe global socioeconomic stress, the delay and cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies in the wake of the shock wave.
Schools and universities in 193 countries, locally or internationally, have closed, affecting nearly 99.4 percent of the student population.
The spread of inaccurate information about the virus online has led to hatred and isolation of citizens from China, South and East Asia and other countries where the virus has been detected.
due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions were reduced.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei province), announced on 31 December 2019 the suspected occurrence of pneumonia of unknown origin, with testing set to begin in January 2020.
Most of the incidents are linked to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, and the virus is thought to have zoonotic origins.
The virus that caused the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus closely related to bats coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. A person with the first symptoms of the disease was diagnosed on December 1, 2019, and that individual has no apparent link to the wet market category.
two-thirds of the cases reported in early december 2019 were market related.
On 13 March 2020, the South China Morning Post reported that the first case was identified in a 55-year-old man in Hubei province, according to a report dated 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that new cases were declining in China and, conversely, were increasing rapidly in Italy, Iran and South Korea.
There may be many minor reported cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
On 26 April, the fewest cases were reported among adolescents under the age of 19, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.Patrick Valance, chief scientific adviser at the UK, estimated that 60% of the UK population would need to be vaccinated before an effective vaccine could be felt.
Cases refer to people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results are confirmed to be positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, had official guidelines not to test only those with mild symptoms.
According to a study published on 16 March, approximately 86% of COVID-19 transmission in China was unrecognized as of 23 January. These unrecorded transmissions were the source of 79% of the recorded transmission of the disease.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March predicted that the number of cases in Italy would be higher than the number of cases recorded.
The initial estimate for the baseline recidivism rate (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concludes that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who don't know, the average time between symptoms and death is 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, there have been approximately 97,000 COVID-19-related deaths.
As of February 5, 80% of all deaths in China were reported among people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing circulatory and diabetes conditions.The official death rate from COVID-19 generally refers to people who died as COVID-19 positive according to official protocols.
The number of deaths from COVID-19 may be higher, excluding deaths from undiagnosed causes, such as deaths at home, by family physician, etc.
Partial data in Italy found that the lockdown death toll during the global pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said, ""We know that [the reported death toll] is underestimated"", adding that such underestimated and underestimated reports in the U.S. are rare during a pandemic, similar to the H1N1 swine flu outbreak in 2009.
The first death from mainland China was reported in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside Asia in France on 14 February.
just outside china, on january 28, more deaths were recorded in iran, south korea and italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories on every continent except Antarctica reported deaths.
These figures vary from region to region, but are influenced by factors such as the number of tests administered, the quality of healthcare, the number of doctors and judges, the time since the outbreak, and population factors such as age, gender, and general health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case-fatality rate as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
the number varies from region to region.
In China, the case-fatality rate has decreased from 17.3% (for symptomatic cases from January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for symptomatic cases after February 1, 2020).Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which is a percentage of the number of deaths from the disease that were monitored, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which is a percentage of the number of deaths from the disease (controlled and uncontrolled).
These statistics are not time-bound and are followed if a particular population is infected through a specific case process.
several scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Health Centre, based on evidence from Oxford University, estimates that the death rate from the outbreak could be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The preliminary estimates for this range are in line with the COVID-19 testing and statistical study conducted in Germany by the CFR estimates.
WHO says the outbreak is under control.
It is difficult to say with certainty when the epidemic reaches its peak and how long it will last, but it can vary from place to place.
The Penn State University's Marsage Pen maintains a constant frequency and the infection rate remains the same.
but it is impossible to predict when this will happen.
"Zhong Nansheng, the top medical adviser to the Chinese government, claims that if all countries follow the WHO's advice on measures to contain the spread of the virus, it could ""stop in June""".
"On March 17, Adam Kucharski of London's Department of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said SARS-CoV-2 ""will be seen repeatedly for a year or two""".
"According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, social distancing and other measures are needed (possibly 18 months or more) "" until a vaccine is available".
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: 'This coronavirus is so easily transmitted that it's hard to say it will go away completely, and I think it could come back every year and turn into a seasonal disease.'"
The damage of the recovery is determined by the mutual immunity and DNA mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms are relatively mild and infected individuals may not have symptoms.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Minor common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, tremor, vomiting, coughing up blood, diarrhea, or rash.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists so-called emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, chronic chest pain or pressure, sudden coughing, difficulty walking, and swelling of the face or lips. If these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Some of those infected may have no symptoms, but the test results indicate a confirmed infection, and researchers suggest that people who have had contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and tested to eliminate the infection.
China estimates the number of people without symptoms at between a few and 44%.
The typical incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is in the range of one to 14 days, usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and later decreased to 15%.
details of how the virus is transmitted are yet to be revealed.
The disease is mainly transmitted by close contact and small droplets formed during coughing, sneezing, or speaking, with close contact being 1-2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that an uncovered cough can cause moisture traveling from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some conclude that the virus can be transmitted through droplets that may form during speech and that these droplets can persist in the air for a long time. Respiratory droplets can also be produced during breathing, including speaking, but the virus is not generally airborne.
They may rest on the mouths or nostrils of people nearby or be drawn into the lungs.
cardiopulmonary recovery (cpr) can expose you to airborne diseases through surgery of the respiratory system.
a person can spread the infection when he touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
although there is a risk of transmission through the veins, the risk is very low.
The Chinese government denies that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted orally. The virus is highly contagious in the first three days after exposure, although it does not show symptoms and can be transmitted by the bite of a tick.
people were diagnosed with the disease three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that the disease could be transmitted before symptoms appeared.
There were very few laboratory-confirmed cases of transmission, but similar transmission was found in other countries without the NICKY virus.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said it was not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, whether a person transmits the disease from two to three people.
The virus can survive for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have also tested positive for COVID-19.
there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but british authorities recommend that people wash their hands after touching an infected person, as they would after touching an animal.
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus of severe respiratory illness, first isolated in three people with pneumonia in Wuhan, linked to a category of severe respiratory illness cases.
All of the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature with the related coronavirus. Outside of human bodies, the virus is killed by soap in the home, because soap removes the immune layer of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
zoonotic origin is suspected.
Genetic testing shows that coronavirus is genetically classified with two strains from the genus betacoronavirus, subgenus serbecovirus (lineage B) and other strains from the genus lupus.
A bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13) is 96% similar to another bat coronavirus at all genomic levels.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genome sequence between pangolins and human viruses.
A full-genome comparison to date has found that approximately 92% of the genetic material is shared between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is enough to confirm that pangolins are intermediate carriers.
A viral infection can be treated based on symptoms, but confirmation is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging.
A study in Wuhan that compared PCR to CT suggested that CT was more susceptible than PCR, but that it had a slightly lower clarity than many of its visual features associated with other lung cancers and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used as a screening test for COVID-19 or as a first-line test.
The World Health Organization published its first edition of guidelines for the RNA testing process for SARS-CoV-2 research on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
the test may be performed on a respiratory tract or a blood sample.
The results are generally available within a few hours to a day.
The test is usually performed by rubbing the inside of the nose and a sample of the throat can be taken. Many laboratories and organizations are developing serological tests, which identify antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been approved for widespread use and have been sufficiently validated.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Selkex is only approved by certified laboratories for emergency services.
radiographs and computed tomography (ct) and the behavior in people with the markers are fluid between the spleen and the spleen that consists of irregularly shaped, crushed glass.
The Italian Society of Radiology is developing an international online image database showing confirmed cases.
Due to overlapping with other infections such as adenovirus, the unverified PCR image is limited in detecting COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and considered it as a faster, more accurate, and more effective screening tool in outbreaks, although the image showed little difference to the disease.
Artificial intelligence: Interactive neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the virus' visual contents on X-rays and CT scans.
strategies to help prevent transmission, including good general hygiene, hand washing, avoiding unwashed hands from touching eyes, nose or mouth, and rubbing and sneezing on soft drinks and throwing the soft drinks directly into a landfill.
people already infected are advised to wear surgical masks before going to public places.
Social distancing measures are also recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.Many governments have banned or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries where the outbreak is most widespread.
However, the virus has reached a point where it is spreading within communities in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community, and some community members do not know where and how they have been infected. Health care providers caring for vulnerable communities are advised to use regular and standard precautions, touch precautions, and eye protection.
The use of government location data on mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns among individuals, Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations have called for limits on such surveillance.
Many mobile applications are available for use on phlagot, and on April 7, 2020, many experts are expecting another update using Bluetooth.
Users will receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infections are spreading, for example, that washing the nose and mouth with mouthwash is not effective.
No vaccine for COVID-19 has been developed, despite efforts by many organizations.
Hand washing is recommended to reduce the spread of infection.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are obviously dirty, before eating, and after touching, coughing, or sneezing.
this is because the virus dies outside the body after washing with soap.
The CDC recommends using a 60% alcohol hand sanitizer where soap and water are not available.
who recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be cleaned with several solutions (a purifier made for stainless steel in one minute), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% propopelool, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and crohexidine gluconate, have been less effective.
The CDC recommends that COVID infection is suspected or confirmed in areas such as service areas, offices or bathrooms, and that laundry rooms, common areas and areas where electricity is shared, tables, shared computers, ATMs, etc. should be disinfected with disinfectant.
health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with a cloth or a cloth cover when they sneeze or sneeze and to immediately discard any cloth.
Surgical field work is recommended only for infected individuals, as it prevents the virus from traveling far and limits the spread of the virus when a person talks, sneezes and coughs.
The world health organization has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
"according to stephen griffin, a virologist at the university of lies, "masks can reduce people's exposure to their faces, thus eliminating the main source of infection that can be caused by unwashed hands". masks can also prevent people who may be infected from contacting others.
Health people should not wear face and mouth coverings, although they are advised to do so if they are sick and are not in good health, even if they understand that it is good to wear face and nose coverings.
Many countries have begun to encourage their citizens to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends non-medical face masks made of cloth. China recommends the use of disposable medical masks for the healthy segment of the population, especially when in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
It recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transportation or in crowded areas.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to wear face masks made from clothing and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outings without masks or nose and mouth coverings.
On March 16, Vietnam ordered all citizens to protect themselves and others by wearing face coverings when going out of their homes to public places.
The Austrian government requires that anyone entering a grocery store wear a face mask.
Israel requires all its citizens to wear face coverings when they go out.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, has mandated that passengers on trains and city buses wear face masks from April 1.
panama requires all travelers to wear face masks, and those who cannot afford them are encouraged to work from home.
face masks have also become widespread in japan, north korea, malaysia, and singapore.
Social distancing or (also known as physical distancing) involves maintaining the conditions for the spread of the disease and reducing contact between individuals to reduce the spread of the disease.
The measures include quarantine, travel bans, and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls.
individuals can implement social distancing measures by staying home, limiting travel, avoiding public places, saying goodbye without touching, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are currently recommending and making social distancing mandatory in the affected states.
The combined number of people recommended by the US government and health organizations was reduced from 250 (if there are no known COVID-19 symptoms) to 50, then to 10.
"On March 22, 2020, Germany imposed a ban on more than two people being in contact with each other outside. The CDC recommends that people with diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, weakened immune systems and those at risk of severe illness and other complications stay out of the home as much as possible in the outbreak area.
The use of the term social distancing refers to people who should engage in full social singleness, rather than advising them to continue contact with others through alternative means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines to be used during a global pandemic.
these include advising that only people who live together and do not have the virus or symptoms have sex.
People suspected of being infected and infected with COVID-19 are advised to stay at home in isolation.
Health agencies have issued detailed self-isolation guidelines.Many governments recommend that people in areas where the virus has been reported isolate themselves.
Strict self-isolation guidelines have been issued for those in high-risk groups.
People who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where the virus is spreading are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the last day of exposure.
strategies to control transmission are blocking or inhibiting and reducing.
The movement restriction is in place in the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of identifying and isolating infected individuals and introducing other new ways of infection control to reduce transmission to the rest of the community.
If the spread of the disease cannot be contained further, trials will then be moved to the control phase, with measures to slow the spread and address its impact on the healthcare system and the community.
Combined prevention and control measures may be taken together.
It requires more drastic measures to reverse the global epidemic by reducing the baseline incidence rate to below 1. Part of infectious disease control is to try to reduce the spread of the disease using a strategy known as epidemic containment.
This will reduce overcrowding in health services and allow more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include self-defense measures such as hand hygiene, mouth and nose coverings and self-isolation; closing of schools, cancelling public gatherings, and ensuring that such restrictions are enforced; and adequate sanitation measures.
other countries have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced comprehensive testing and quarantine, and notices are issued when infected people are active.
Singapore has once again sanctioned those who do not support the temporary self-isolation.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and the coordinated distribution of medical supplies.A survey by the United Kingdom and the United States shows that mitigation (reducing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and control (reversing the progression of the epidemic) have serious challenges.
The use of preferential policies reduces deaths by half while reducing early health problems by two thirds.
Suppression may be preferable while the virus is still spreading in humans, but it must wait (or until a vaccine is available, if that comes first), when conditions demand, for transmission to recover quickly.
long-term interventions to contain the epidemic will lead to a positive social and economic crisis.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
taking prescription medications, drinking fluids, and resting can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory support may be required.
use of steroids can lead to worse effects.
Several sites approved for treatment of viral diseases are being evaluated for COVID-19 treatment.
"The World Health Organization has also stated that some ""traditional and home remedies"" may provide relief from symptoms of SARS-CoV-19".
WHO said that increasing capacity for the needs of COVID-19 patients and facilitating healthcare is a fundamental measure to contain the spread of the disease.
The ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have provided guidance to hospitals and primary healthcare services to mobilize resources in multiple sizes, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, eliminating procedures wherever possible, identifying and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and training staff to increase critical care capacity and increase the number of existing respirators and beds.
there are many theories about the origin of the first case (patient zero).
The first reported case of coronavirus was in Wuhan, Hubei, China on December 1, 2019.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in hubei has gradually decreased.
Most of these were linked to the wholesale market for Hawanyan seafood, which is in addition to selling live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animal species, or in other words, zoonotic origin. Zhang Jixian, a doctor who reported to the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC, was treated at the clinic for pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26 and at the Hebei Provincial Hospital on December 27.
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned colleagues of an outbreak of a SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false news, while another, Ai Fen, was disciplined by her boss for spreading the news.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued an official announcement on 31 December and notified WHO.
Sufficient cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan for testing in early January. During the first phase of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the migration and transportation hub of China's New Year and major rail exchanges helped spread the virus to other Chinese provinces.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a single day, including two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy in the number of confirmed cases. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and introduced border controls due to the outbreak in Europe.
National measures include curfews (stay at home, lockdowns) and lockdowns.As of April 2, nearly 300 million or 90% of the population in the United States is under curfew; 50 million in the Philippines are under curfew; 59 million in South Africa are under curfew; and 1.3 billion in India are under curfew.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people were in lockdown, up from 2.6 billion in two months.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan on December 1, 2019, while an unconfirmed report indicates the previous case was detected on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian was diagnosed with an unknown pneumonia case on December 26, and reported it to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) from her hospital on December 27.
December 27, 2019 Genetic testing of patient samples shows the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
the world health organization was notified on the same day.
at the time of these announcements, doctors in the water received a warning from the police for spreading rumors.
China's National Health Commission said there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission in the first place.
In late january, the chinese government launched an active campaign, described by general secretary of the communist party of china xi jinping as a "people's war" to stop the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as the largest quarantine in human history, a cordon sanitaire, or travel ban, was imposed on January 23 in Wuhan, and the order was implemented in 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.
the use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) has been canceled in many places.
the authorities also announced that a temporary hospital called the houshenchan hospital will be built within 10 days.
another hospital, lechenchan hospital, was built to treat more patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China has converted 14 specialised facilities in Wuhan, such as public entertainment venues and stadiums, into state hospitals.On 26 January, the government took additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, including new announcements and announcements for travellers and an extension of the date of special celebrations.
Universities and schools across the state are closed.
In Hong Kong and Macau, several measures have been taken, especially regarding schools and universities.
remote working measures have been introduced in many regions of China.
travel restrictions were in place in and out of Hubei.
museums are temporarily closed as I switch public transportation throughout China.
"Public movement controls have been imposed in several cities, and some 760 million people (about half of China's total population) have been restricted from leaving their homes. Since the outbreak entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from ""entering"" China from other countries".
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day lockdown on foreigners. On March 23, only one case was reported in China five days earlier.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that domestically transmitted cases were basically contained and the spread was under control in China.
On the same day, movement restrictions were eased in Hubei, two months after the ban on travel outside Wuhan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that people with entry visas or residence permits would not be able to enter from 28 March, but it was not clear when this policy would be lifted.
People wishing to enter China should apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government has been working to restore and encourage the activities of various businesses and factories that were closed due to COVID-19 since 21 March 2012, and has provided financial support to encourage and revitalize these organizations. Although it is in line with the annual Qingming Festival, the country's authorities also declared 26 March 2012 as a national day of mourning at 4:00 pm, with a 3-minute prayer of conscience.
In January 2020, COVID-19 was reported to have spread from China to South Korea.
The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely due to gatherings at Daegu's new religious movement known as Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji's visit to Wuhan has raised doubts that the reinforcement could be the source of the spread.
As of February 22, around 13% of the 9,336 churchgoers in the country had 1,261 symptoms.
On February 28, there were more than 2,000 confirmed cases, rising to 3,150 on January 29.
all south korean military camps have been put into quarantine following the infection of three soldiers.
Flight schedules have also been affected and have been changed.South Korea has introduced the world's largest and most organized program to screen the population for the virus and identify any infected people, and to track and isolate contacts.
Screening strategies include mandatory self-reporting of new global arrivals via mobile app, virus testing from the car, where results are announced the next day, and increasing the testing capacity to 20,000 people per day.
The South Korean programme has been shown to be effective in controlling the outbreak, although it did not shut down entire cities.
Many Koreans have been working on petitions to demand President Moon be impeached or to thank him for his response to the government's mismanagement of the pandemic.

In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was widely used on Twitter.
racial violence, as well as increased rates of violence, have been reported among the Chinese population as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States.
US President Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus", and has been described as racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine have attacked a bus carrying Ukrainians and other foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanjari.
students from northeastern india, which shares a border with china, and from major indian cities have reportedly been harassed in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
"In West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state wing, said China has ruined nature and ""that is why God is avenging them"".
"The Chinese Consulate in Calcutta later condemned the comments as ""false"". In China, xenophobia and racism have spread among non-Chinese residents due to the pandemic, with foreigners described as ""external waste"" and "targeted for elimination"".
Many newspapers that do not have paid-only sections have removed these sections due to some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers related to the outbreak open for public access.
Some scientists have shared their results on servers such as bioRxiv to quickly prep print.

Laboratory tests use methods that detect the presence of respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the related SARS-CoV-2 virus and antibodies that respond to this infection.
The virus in the samples is detected by RT-PCR and is able to identify the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is limited and useful for detecting SARS-CoV-2.
It is used to identify recent or active contaminants.
serology helps with diagnosis and population monitoring.
antibody tests reveal how many people have the disease, including how many people have symptoms but are too small to report or have no symptoms at all.
The exact mortality rate and immunity of the population can be determined from this test.
Due to limited testing, no country has accurate data on the extent of the transmission in its population as of March 2020.
As of 23 march, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a significant variation in testing between countries.
this separation has the potential to have a significant impact on mortality rates, because it is a higher than correct estimate in some countries.
Using simultaneous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test allows for the analysis of a sample obtained by inhalation or excretion.
Results are available in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing using a fluid sample from the throat is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
the virus can then spread from the throat to the lungs.
For infected individuals who have been tested in the second week, an alternative sampling device from deep airways may be used with an aspiration catheter or saliva sample (surgical).
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Berlin in January 2020 by the manufacturer Charité. The simultaneous reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) process, distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO), produced 250,000 tests.
The United Kingdom also launched a test on January 23, 2020. A South Korean company called Kogenebiotech launched a clinical PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detector (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
"It seeks the ""E"" gene found in all coronaviruses, and seeks the RdRp gene for SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI Group was among the first organizations to receive emergency benefits from the China National Health Products Administration, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 identification tool. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States will simultaneously distribute the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RT-PCR diagnostic panel to community health laboratories through global agent sources".
Three of the genetic tests resulted in inaccurate results due to the detection of inaccurate reagents in older test kits and a test at the CDC in Atlanta, which was conducted successfully with an average of 100 samples per day throughout February 2020.
As of February 28, 2020, two-component tests were not considered reliable, and national and local laboratories had not been authorized to conduct tests until now.
The test is authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that it had a nationwide RT-PCR-based COVID-19 test.
Quest Diagnostics had prepared a national COVID-19 test on March 9/2020.
There is no set limit on the amount, and sampling and sampling must be done according to CDC standards.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by VECTOR, the state research center for virology and biotechnology.
On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from the FDA to perform a test that can provide results in a maximum of 3.5 hours, allowing 4,128 tests to be performed in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA approved emergency use (EUA) for Abbott Laboratories, which is testing the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA has granted similar licenses to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid received the same EUA from the FDA, which lasts 45 minutes.
The FDA suggests licensing isotermean nucleic acid amplification technology as a replacement for PCR.
This does not require a temperature cycle to change, so a positive result in as little as five minutes and a negative result in as little as 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 machines in the United States, and Abbott is accelerating production to allow 50,000 tests per day.A test using monoclonal antibodies is directly linked to the novel coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) and is expected to show results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to a rapid influenza test.
The March 2020 Literature Review concluded that the cost of chest X-rays in the early stages is very low, but that CT results may be available even before the markings are seen on the site.
Typical features on CT include bi-multilobar ground-glass opacifiers with a matched, unmatched and backward distribution.
The stress of sub-diversity, incorrectness, and inclusiveness increases as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR in water with CT at the starting point found that CT had a higher reception characteristic than PCR, but had lower limitations, with most of its imaging characteristics similar to those of pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used as a primary test for COVID-19.
The immune response is the production of antibodies to infection, and includes IgM and IgG.
People who have had these symptoms for 7 days or more are used to diagnose infection, determine immunity, and in population studies. Tests may be done in central laboratories (CLT) or at point of care (PoCT).
automated systems called hi-sprut can perform these tests in most clinical laboratories, and the detection rate will be determined by the production volume in each system.
A blood sample is usually used for CLT, but serum samples may be used to see the immune response.
A blood sample for PoCT is usually obtained by injection.
Unlike PCR methods, pre-launch measures are not required.The 29 institutions that notified the agency as required on March 26, 2020, have now been able to distribute antibody tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use License.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for the detection of IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test has the capacity to test hundreds of samples per hour and is faster than PCR, which is the usual way to isolate viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually differentiated within 14 days of infection.No antibody detector purchased in the UK in early April was useful.
Hong Kong has taken measures to allow suspected patients to stay at home, with the emergency department providing a sample tube to the patient, who will be vaccinated, returned and receive test results later.The UK NHS is making arrangements to test suspected cases at home, preventing suspected cases from infecting others if they leave the hospital, and using an ambulance to clear infections if they do.
The drive-through centers have enabled the fastest, most comprehensive testing in South Korea. In Germany, the National Medical Cooperation of Legal Health Insurance, which has a capacity of 12,000 tests per day, said on March 2 that 10,700 tests were performed in the previous week in an ambulance.
the cost of a doctor's appointment for a medical examination is covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct 160,000 tests a week.
As of march 19, driving tests were scheduled in many major cities.
The total number of tests performed in Germany on 26 March 2020 is unknown, as only positive results are reported.
"Primary laboratory studies show that at least 483,295 samples have been tested since calendar week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) have been confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 as of 12/2020.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital have tested a method to test samples from 64 patients at once, only if a combined sample is found to be positive by mixing samples.Hyu-ya "" (Chinese-çœç1⁄4, or ""fire eye in English") was opened on February 5, 2020 at BGI, which can process 10,000 samples per day".
With construction under the close supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the model work could have been increased by 47% in Hubei, and the cost of isolation would have doubled if the testing had not begun.
The Wuhan laboratory was followed by 12 cities across China, including Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
As of March 4, 2020, daily mass tests were 50,000 per day.The open source multiplex design was released by Origami Assays and allows testing of 1122 COVID-19 patient samples using only 93 tests.These balanced designs can be done in small labs and do not require robotic fluid containers.
In March, testing scarcity and shortages became a major factor in the mass testing process in the European Union, the UK and the US.
This has led some authors to investigate some of the testing procedures - heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA sequences and allow further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was testing more per capita than any other country, and was on the way to reaching a wider audience.
"This is a drive-through, and a full-scale operation involving the laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (which is based at the Emergency Laboratory in ""Huo-Yan"" China)".
The lab, built in 14 days, can perform thousands of RT-PCR tests a day, the first in the world outside China to do so at this scale.
Different test sequences targeting different genome segments of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has designated Germany's production order for low-income countries that cannot produce their own devices.
The German order was issued on January 17, 2020, while the protocol issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not ready until January 28, which delayed testing in the United States and China, while the United States had problems with testing equipment uncertainty at the beginning of the pandemic, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient testing equipment to meet demand and provide recommendations by health professionals.
On the contrary, experts say, the extensive testing capacity in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has been building testing capacity in its laboratories, mostly in the private sector, for years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization urged to speed up testing to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The increased demand for testing equipment due to the high spread of the virus has led to a shortage of hundreds of thousands of virus tests and a shortage of chemical products.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its detectors.
In the United States, tests by the CDC were flawed and the government removed bureaucracies that restricted private testing. Spain purchased tests from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but the results were inaccurate.
the organization explains that the wrong results may be due to poor sampling or improper use of the equipment.
According to the Spanish Ministry, the devices that produced erroneous results will be returned and replaced with a separate test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic and China produced erroneous results.
Prime Minister Matović suggested that these be dumped in the Danube. According to Ateş Kara, an employee of the Turkish Ministry of Health, Turkey did not use the test kits it bought from China because they had a high error rate.
Testing, isolating positive individuals and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 cases has led to positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of VÃ2, where the first COVID-19 death in Italy was recorded, conducted two rounds of testing in a total of 3,400 people, with ten days' interval.
Half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and all known cases were in isolation.
restrictions on travel to the community have been used to stop new infections.
With the need for a high contact line, travel restrictions and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus outbreak spread more slowly in Singapore than in other developed countries, but no severe measures were taken, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home until March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 after a break.
Many other countries have managed to control the outbreak with high levels of contact tracing, restricted travel, testing, quarantine, but less with moderate national movement restrictions, as seen in Iceland and South Korea.
According to statistical studies, countries with more testing than deaths are likely to have fewer cases, perhaps because these countries are easier to identify than those without or with no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with limited testing capacity and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 testing experience send their initial five positive COVID-19 samples and ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 testing centers for stabilization testing.
Of the 16 suggested laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in South America, and 1 in Australia.
the positive column in the following table is influenced by the country's testing policy in terms of the percentage of people tested.
A country that tests only those in hospital has a higher percentage of positive cases than a country that tests its entire population, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not.
hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning hands to remove dirt, grease, germs, or other unwanted substances.
washing hands with soap and water at certain critical times of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted to the mouth with unwashed hands.
For example, if people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous tissue), they can also contract respiratory illnesses such as influenza or the common cold.
The five critical times of day when handwashing with soap and water is necessary include: before and after cleaning the toilet, after wiping the bottom of the baby or changing diapers, before feeding and eating, and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be washed with ash.
before, during, and after preparing food.
before and after caring for a sick person.
after changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the toilet.
after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
after you have eaten animal feces, or after you have touched animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
hand washing before taking medication or receiving medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or parasites that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
this is especially important for those who prepare food or work in the medical field, but it is also a useful practice for the general public.
hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronaviruses and other infectious diseases, preventing infectious causes of diarrhea, and reducing respiratory infections.
and plans to reduce infant mortality at home births.
A 2013 study found that improved handwashing habits may result in small improvements in height for children under five.
the mortality rate of children in developing countries from respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap and water.
this simple step can reduce the death rate from these diseases by as much as 50%.
interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea cases by up to a third, compared to providing clean water to low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in diarrheal frequency can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Washing with soap is the single most effective and simple way to prevent diarrheal and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in homes, schools and communities worldwide.
pneumonia is a major ARI and the number one cause of death, claiming the lives of approximately 1.8 million children under the age of five each year.
each year, about 3.5 million children die from diarrhea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap and water before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, reduce deaths from diarrhea by half and deaths from severe respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is often combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and personal hygiene (WASH) programs.
hand washing also protects against contagious skin diseases that are transmitted through direct physical contact.
The slightest harm in hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to dry skin.
a 2012 study in denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause a skin condition called hand itching, or hand itching, which is especially common among health care workers.
Washing hands too often is also one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times of day when washing with soap is necessary to reduce the spread of infection: after using the toilet (urinate, flush), after cleaning the bottom of the baby (change hygiene), before feeding the baby, before feeding and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Proper hand washing is necessary to prevent the spread of disease, including before and after treating a cut or wound; after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing; after touching animal waste or touching animals; and after touching litter.
in many countries, the minimum is to wash hands with soap and water.
A 2015 study on hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households have a habit of hand washing at home. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest share of 97%. The United States was near the middle at 77%, and China was the lowest at 23%.
The Essential Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is cited as a model for action to promote children's health and education.
twice a year, the national program aims to raise awareness of the need to wash hands regularly with soap, brush your teeth regularly with fluoride and kill germs.
it has been successfully implemented in indonesia.
removing microorganisms from the skin is improved by adding water to soaps or liquid soaps.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the solubility of solutions and increase solubility.
the fats and proteins that make up organic soil are not easily removed by water, so water alone is an inadequate skin cleanser.
However, cleaning is aided by a reasonable water flow.
dry soap can be reused and may contain bacteria from previous use.
a few studies that have examined the transmission of bacteria in contaminated hard soap have concluded that it clears bacteria from the foam and causes fewer problems.
The CDC still says that liquid soap is preferable to hand-free controls.
antibacterial soaps have been widely promoted in a society that supports healthy habits.
to date, there is no evidence that the use of antibiotics or antibiotics recommended for the treatment of antibiotic resistant cells in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain a common antibacterial carrier, such as tricone, which contains a large list of antibodies.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as thought.
In addition to skin protection agents, advanced forms may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) such as pH regulator, antibacterial active benzyl acid and additional skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, flavonoids, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that clear soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps at preventing pain and keeping bacteria out of the fire.
hot water that is convenient for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
bacteria grow very quickly at body temperature (37 ° c).
however, hot and soapy water is more effective at removing soil and natural oils that contain bacteria than cold, soapy water.
contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies show that hot water has no effect on reducing microbial stress on the hands.
hand sanitizer or hand towel is another option for water-free hand hygiene.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, non-alcoholic and water-based hand sanitizer alternatives (also known as alcohol-free hand sanitizers, antiseptic hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (a polymer of oxalic acid) to reduce the effect of gel, or as a liquid glycerin, or for use in powder and alcohol drying to reduce the use of alcohol.
The addition of mixed hydrogen peroxide increases the activity of the antibiotic. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective germ killers.
alcohol-based hygiene products kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), pneumonia, and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
70% alcohol hand sanitizers remove 99.97% of bacteria from hands after 30 seconds of application (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibels) and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) 7 bacteria from hands in 1 minute.
Alcohol-containing hand sanitizers are not fully effective in eliminating the viral infection (or norvex) virus, which is the most common cause of gastrointestinal illness. Hand antiseptic or alcohol washing should be used to dry or cover both hands thoroughly.
The front and back of all fingers and the tips of all fingers are smeared for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The fingertips and both palms should be thoroughly washed, with the fingertips and palms wiped. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using hand sanitizer, especially when hand contamination is evident.
The increase in the use of these agents is due to their ease of use and quick killing of microorganisms, but they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if lubricants and/or skin conditioners are not included in the formula.
The effect of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softeners to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers resulted in significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antibacterial soaps.
allergic skin disease, osteoarthritis, or alcohol-induced hand allergy, or the contents of an alcoholic hand sanitizer, are less likely to cause allergies.
The incidence of infectious skin diseases is higher than handwashing with soap and water.
Although effective, waterless agents do not wash the hands of organic materials, but they easily destroy them.
This is why hand sanitizers are considered unsuitable for preventing the spread of many pathogens, as soap and water are not, as pathogens can still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends primarily on ingredients and flavorings, with the efficiency level being reduced to alcohol and alcohol-free bottles.
Recently, benzene chloride formulations have been shown to decrease in effectiveness after repeated use, in contrast to alcohol, which appears to decrease in effectiveness after repeated use.
many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use mud or dirt instead.
ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but it may be less effective than soap.
one concern is that contaminated soil or soil may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce the risk of disease.
like soap, ash is a pesticide because it forms an alkaline solution when it is in contact with water.
when soap is not available, the world health organization recommends that ashes or sand be used as an alternative.
The proper hand washing practices recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control include:
wash your hands with warm or cold water.
running water is recommended because pools can be contaminated, and the yeh meanwhile does not seem to cause a difference in water temperature.
wash hands with soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the elbows.
soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more frequently in the presence of soap than with water alone.
search for at least 20 seconds.
Massage creates a smoothie that helps remove germs from the skin, and prolonged massage removes many germs.
wash thoroughly with running water.
Washing hands in a pool can re-contaminate them.
Use a clean towel or let the air dry.
Wet and wet hands are more prone to re-infection. The most commonly overlooked areas are the thumb, wrist, inter-finger areas, and under the fingers.
artificial nails and cracked nail dyes can cause small insects.
It is recommended to use hand lotion to prevent dry hands; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
"Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate handwashing where tap water and/or soap are not available, for example: extracting water from a hanging jericho or well-fit holes and/or using salt if necessary in developing countries. In cases of water shortages (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving options such as ""TPI-Taps"" and other low-cost options are available".
Tape-tap is a simple hand-operated technology using a hook wrapped in wire and a small amount of water and a barrel of soap.
Although effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, there is some debate about the most effective way to dry in public bathrooms.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted at the University of Westminster in London, and a paper towel industry-sponsored European Tasis Symposium air hand dryer was used to compare the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and the most advanced jet-air.
After hand washing and drying with the hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria detected increased on the fingers by an average of 194% and on the hands by 254%.
Drying with the jet-air dryer increased the total bacterial population by an average of 42% on the ear pads and 15% on the mice.
After hand washing and drying with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% in the fingers and 77% in the palms of the hands. Scientists conducted tests to determine the potential contamination of the bathroom environment by other bathroom users due to each type of drying method.
The air-operated dryer, which blew air at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h), was capable of releasing microorganisms from the hands and appliances and contaminating other bathroom users and the bathroom environment up to 2 meters away.
using a hot air dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper dryers did not show any evidence of bacterial growth. A 2005 study by TÃœV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated various methods of hand drying.
the following changes in bacterial counts have been observed after hand drying.
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are comparable to paper towel dryers.
Hand washing is another option when you are traveling when soap and water are not available.
alcohol-free hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
hand washing became a medical requirement long after ignaz semmelweis, a hungarian physician, demonstrated its effectiveness in preventing illness in a hospital setting (1846).
hospital workers have electronic devices that provide feedback to remind them to wash their hands if they forget to do so.
one study found a lower incidence of infection with their use.
Medical hand-washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using soap and water or gel to spread and massage each part of the hands.
hands should be washed with fingers.
If there is dirt in your fingernails, use a brush to remove it.
since germs can remain on hands in water, it is important to wipe and dry them thoroughly with a clean towel.
Once dry, use a paper towel to close the water (and leave any outlets open if necessary).
this prevents the hands from being contaminated again by those surfaces.
"The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare environment is to remove and prevent the spread of microorganisms ("germs") by related pathogens".
The new england journal of medicine reports that hand washing has become unacceptable in most medical settings, resulting in a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading germs.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures reduce catheter-related bleeding rates by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a paper on regular hand washing and hand sanitization in healthcare settings.
The organization's draft hand hygiene guidelines can also be found for public comment on the website.
an important review was made by witby et al.
If a declaration of compliance with regulatory requirements is required, commercial equipment can measure and verify hand hygiene.
"The World Health Organization has defined "five seasons" of hand washing".
After exposure to blood/excreted body fluids
Before the pollution-free activity, and
After patient care. Adding antibacterial chemicals to soap (antibacterial or antibacterial soaps) indicates hand washing agent.
Such removal may be required before surgery or in indoor settings where antibiotic-resistant bacteria are most prevalent. To perform surgery, you will need to 'massage' your hands, a shower hose that can be opened and closed without touching your hands, dry towels to dry your hands after washing, wash with some chlorhexidine or iodine, and other disinfectant equipment for dry brushes, massage, and under-finger cleaning.
all should wear jewelry.
This procedure usually requires 2 to 6 minutes of hand and wrist washing.
No need for long checking times (10 minutes).
during the process of washing, the water on the cord must be prevented from flowing back into the hands.
after the hand washing is complete, the hands are dried with a clean cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
In the control of staph infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit of handwashing was found to be 20% of the initial wash, and a small additional benefit when handwashing frequency increased above 35%.
Washing hands with soap is more than three times more likely to cause foodborne infection than with antibacterial soap. A comparison of hand-washing with alcohol-based soap for an average of 30 seconds compared with handwashing with antibacterial soap showed that hand-washing with alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than with antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in reducing the spread of H1N1 influenza A virus and clostidum difusil from hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare facilities may include education for hand washing staff, increased alcohol-based hand washing, and written and verbal notices to staff.
more research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
in developing countries, handwashing with soap and water is seen as a cost-effective, healthy and nutritious option.
However, the lack of a reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes achieving global handwashing standards challenging.
For example, while there are cheaper options for building handwashing stations, handwashing facilities are scarce in rural Africa, near every private or public toilet.
However, low handwashing rates may also be the result of established practices rather than a lack of soap or water.
Awareness and education about handwashing with soap and water can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to lasting behavioral change in the public.
control and evaluation are essential for this to work effectively.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social media campaigns were not. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the three-star approach by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum criteria are met, schools can grow from one to three stars.
Building handwashing stations can be part of handwashing awareness campaigns to reduce illness and infant mortality.
Another example is the global handwashing awareness campaign that is trying to bring about a change in behavior. Due to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the promotion of handwashing emojis.
A few studies look at the overall cost of handwashing in developing countries in relation to DALYs.
However, one study found that encouraging hand washing with soap is more effective than other water and hygiene measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers being treated in hospital, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician who worked in Vienna, Hungary, and Florence Nightingale, an Englishwoman who founded modern nursing.
at that time, many people believed that infections were caused by odors called miasma.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as a critical way to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak have led to increased awareness in many countries of the need to wash with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with "proper hand washing techniques" are hung in public toilets and hand washing facilities in buildings and airports.
washing one's hands means refusing to accept responsibility or to participate in the matter.
The phrase "the hand of Jesus Christ" is derived from the biblical passage in the gospel of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands before deciding to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used phrase in some English-speaking communities.
in shakespeare's macbeth, lady macbeth begins to wash her hands violently to clear her guilty conscience of the crimes she committed and incited her husband to commit.
he also found that people are more likely to wash their hands and hand sanitizers after recalling or contemplating immoral behavior than others.
In addition, they are less likely to participate in other voluntary remedial measures, such as cleaning, which are allowed after such meditation.
Religions require hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, the use of water without soap to wash hands, is a hand washing system in many religions, including Baha'i, Hindu, Tevilah and Netelai Yadaim in Judaism, Lavo in Christianity, and Wudu in Islam.
hinduism, judaism, and islam require hand washing after using the toilet.
And: hinduism, buddhism, sikhism, judaism and islam require hand washing before and after every meal.
Workplace risk management for COVID-19
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 are workplace safety measures for the control and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Effective risk management in the workplace will depend on the workplace and the type of work, including risk assessment of risk sources, community transmission and individual risk factors for COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are those with low contact with the community and coworkers, which require basic infection prevention measures such as hand washing, keeping employees at home if sick, continuing the respiratory process and the usual hygiene and disinfection.
Moderate-risk occupations are those who work with people who are in direct contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may be infected due to ongoing transmission or international travel.
this includes people who move from the community, such as schools, populated areas, and high-end retail locations.
This group should be equipped with a respirator that uses a highly filtered air filter and personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person with COVID-19, in addition to basic infection prevention measures.
OSHA considers people who are known or suspected to be at high risk of COVID-19 to be at high risk, with a much higher risk if workers are collecting samples from people known or suspected to have COVID-19 while performing airborne respiratory procedures.
The correct hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure respirators and personal protective equipment suitable for the job.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have many impacts on the workplace.
employees may be unable to work due to illness, caring for others, and fear of exposure.
business processes may change, including what products are needed and how those products are purchased (e.g., during off-peak hours, through a delivery person, or through a drive-through service).
Finally, shipments to areas with high COVID-19 prevalence may be disrupted.Epidemic preparedness and response planning can be used to take protective measures.
There are plans for many workplaces and types of work, including sources of exposure, sources of risk from home and community, and sources of risk for each employee with a large age and severe health condition.
they also explain the controls needed to avoid those risks and plans for possible outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to the outbreak are to reduce transmission among workers, prevent people from developing health problems, protect businesses and reduce negative impacts on other parts of the supply chain.
the severity of the disease in the business area determines the response.
The Risk Management Framework is used to assess the effectiveness of the risk management process for occupational safety and the management of risks to the team.
In areas where COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective control methods are engineering controls, which are supported by administrative control and ultimately personal protective equipment.
engineering controls are designed to separate workers from work-related hazards, rather than based on worker behavior, which can be a cost-effective method to implement.
administrative controls are changes to work policies or procedures that require action by the employee or employer.
Although the effectiveness of personal protective equipment is less than that of engineering and administrative control, it can help reduce some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected (e.g. filters) as appropriate, as required by the worker, and must be in a consistent and appropriate condition, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced, and properly disposed of, cleaned and stored or used to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have low contact with the community and other colleagues.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces are frequent and thorough hand washing, advising people to stay home if they are sick, covering respiratory-related measures such as coughing and sneezing, preparing for soft and dirty waste, being prepared to work by phone and avoid shifts, encouraging employees to avoid using other people's tools, and regularly cleaning the workplace.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a critical step to protect employees, customers and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people with severe respiratory problems with fever, fever, or other symptoms stay at home for 24 hours until they are better, but not take any medications that reduce fever or reverse other symptoms, and that sick leave policies be flexible, allow employees to stay at home, and that employees be aware of these.
According to OSHA, moderate-risk jobs require frequent close contact, i.e. up to six feet (1.8 m) with people who are suspected or known to have COVID-19, but may be people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission or who have recently traveled to countries with high COVID-19 transmission.
This includes managing and providing customer service to employees with contacts in schools, high-density areas, and other high-risk retail stores. For this and high-risk groups, engineering controls require high-efficiency air purification, increased respiration, physical barriers such as plastic sneeze protection, and drive-through window service. Administrative controls and high-risk groups include encouraging sick employees to stay home, changing face-to-face meetings in virtual meetings, limiting regular shifts, preventing the continuation of travel to places that may cause COVID-19 symptoms, making contact with people who are at risk of exposure to COVID-19, making personal protective equipment and other measures that can help protect workers from exposure to the virus, and making people aware of the risks of contact with the environment, including making contact with a contactless person, making personal protective equipment and other measures that can help protect against COVID-19, and making people aware of the risks of contact with the environment, including making contact with a contactless person, making contact with a contactless person, and making personal protective measures and/or protective measures to protect themselves from COVID-19, and/or others who have a workplace, or work environment, and/or who are at risk of COVID-19, and/or who are at risk of exposure to the environment.
workers in this risk group rarely use respirators.
Proper controls to protect the crew and other passengers from illness on board include isolating the sick person with a distance of 6 feet, serving the sick person and providing a face mask to the front passenger, or asking them to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when they are sick or sneezing.
Airline personnel should use disposable gloves when handling sick passengers or when touching body fluids or potentially contaminated objects, and should use additional personal protective equipment if a sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag and contaminated items should be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. Hazard control controls for commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, include postponing travel and self-isolation and informing the medical center on board immediately if a fever or other symptoms are present on board.
For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends temporary closures and cleaning or disinfection, regardless of whether an infected person has been in the school building and community transmission.
In cases of low to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling travel schedules, disrupting meetings and other learning events, such as school, stopping large gatherings in choir rooms or cafeterias, increasing the distance between seats, separating arrival and departure times, prohibiting non-essential visitors, and identifying separate offices for testing of symptomatic children.
In high-prevalence communities, extended school closures may be considered an alternative to social distancing.The CDC estimates that the immediate health risk to law enforcement personnel performing their daily duties is low.
Law enforcement officials who must contact individuals who are infected or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during stressful hours, workers should clean their work belts and equipment of infection with a spray or wipe before reusing or using household items, and should store and dispose of used PPE and containers and laundry using the prescribed work procedures.
OSHA identifies some health care and mortuary workers as having a high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk jobs include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory and exposures to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This is a serious risk if workers work in aerosol-producing processes or with suspected COVID-19 patients.
procedures that produce airborne particles, tubing in the respiratory tract, procedures that initiate saliva, bronchoscopy some dental procedures and tests or a preventive sampling.
High-risk morgue work includes the work of people who prepare the bodies of people suspected of having COVID-19 at the time of their death, meaning that autopsies from Hanoi will be high-risk.Additional engineering controls for these jobs include placing people with suspected or known COVID-19 in quarantine if they are working in airborne particulate matter.
special negative pressure respirators may be required for some health care or mortuary applications.
Samples are required to take precautions at biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that arriving patients stay in a restricted quarantine area based on suspected COVID-19. In addition to PPE, OSHA recommends that people who are suspected of working within 6 feet of each other and are with people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who work in airborne particulate matter use respirators.
In the United States, NIOSH has approved N95 face masks for use in respirators or should be used in a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes screening, training, and health screenings.
Other types of respirators provide greater protection and enhance work comfort. WHO does not recommend full coverage, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is transmitted through body fluids.
WHO recommends that only personnel testing at entry points wear surgical masks.
For people who are caring for COVID-19 patients or transporting patients who are not emitting airborne particles, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, eye or face masks and gloves.
If the air-conditioning process is performed, the surgical mask will be replaced with a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
In response to the global lack of PPE, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical restriction, i.e. access to only those who need direct care through clean windows, use of personal protective equipment for a limited number of people, caring for multiple people without a respirator, controlling the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and coordinating for people who do not show symptoms.

The case: [Covid-19] easing stress and preparing for the future
The time of delivery: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC.
License: CC0: No rights are reserved
this month we find ourselves in a different situation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has clarified our global human relationships and our responsibilities to one another.
While we have no precedent for the challenges, our best response is global understanding, cooperation and community building, which is central to this agenda.
the friendliness and concern we see among our employees through email, phone and chat are a testament to how great we are at working with such wonderful people.
i consider myself lucky to have known all of you as a colleague.
last week someone told me how much he appreciated our work.
It's a great sign of how important it is for our world to return to Wikipedia and make this important contribution online and available to everyone.
Your job is to make this happen, whether you take the job, whether our colleagues get paid, or whether our community is safe.
The world needs Wikipedia more than ever.
this is the time when not only what we do but how we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
this mission and your role are so important that we may be making some major adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
We were able to work with the local branch office.
As Robyn has previously stated, the C-Team met last night to discuss our course and agenda for the coming days and months.
during that talk, we thought about what the right answer to the problem would be and what we could do to keep our organization going in the meantime.
we wanted to avoid the stress of our assignment and stay there for a long time.
if you want to call back, that's fine.
For all employees, temporary and temporary workers:
the daily work schedule will be 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week until further notice.
not a vacation - if you can work overtime, the assignment can be beneficial.
but the world is unpredictable, and whether you are caring for your family, shopping, or seeing a doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We do not track your time.
if you don't believe it, don't work.
that is not necessary, but we will.
No sick days or PTO required - you only need to tell the administrative staff and check your team's calendars and schedules to ensure key work areas are covered.
(If your COVID-19 test result is positive, please contact Brian to assist with support and ensure that your case receives appropriate attention from the administration.)
people are paid in full every hour.
we have done before, and we will continue to do so for our contractors and our clockworkers.
all employees are paid during normal working hours.
this includes those who are unable to work because of illness.
if you want to work, we will help you.
many people use work as a way to relieve stress from the world around them.
our work can be very productive, especially at times like these.
This is about taking care of yourself again.
Our question is to talk to your administration about what to expect and how to prepare.
some jobs are considered necessary.
there are some things we need to continue to do.
SRE, HR processes, trust and safety and fundraising teams (among others) perform critical work that may require additional support.
we begin a process in all departments to turn the present purpose and focus into what is necessary for our purpose.
we all have a lot of work to do, and we all focus on what is most important.
It is not harmful to be late.
we have no plans to double the working hours to complete the delayed work once this pandemic is over.
you don't have to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines these days.
we recognize that circumstances have changed, and we work to set new goals and timelines as needed.
What is created on the APP (Annual Plan)?
to adapt to our new reality and daily working hours, we need to adjust the timing of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our goal is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will allow employees to organize their essential work, take care of themselves, take care of their families, and meet the needs of those who want to work less hours.
this extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and pressure on the entire organization.
We will notify our staff to the board next week and let representatives and teams know what the next step is as soon as we receive the information.
Thank you for your leadership in this time for the APP team.
The office environment, exposure, and cleanliness
Last week, we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But, out of a precaution, we have hired de-virus staff for the San Francisco office.
They have made every floor infection-free using a de-viral mixture of the type used in hospitals, including the neck receiver and the elevator banks that reach our floor.
The building has its own care process by using its own products that protect the safety of tenants.
we are confident that the office will be fully operational when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork and they have shared their COVID-19 process with us and our staff in DC.
Last week, our DC office followed San Francisco's guidelines to work from home.
As some of our staff in NYC know, we are also talking about renting space in Brooklyn.
these discussions continue, but they may be delayed.
some of our colleagues are working from home for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know that it can be a adjustment, and they wanted to give you some advice:
limit the length of the meetings to one or two hours.
if longer sessions are needed, consider how to divide the sessions into smaller sessions over several days.
clearly describe the meeting, have an agenda, and send out reading materials in advance.
Make video the default, which includes tools like Google Docs and Zoom to enable direct collaboration and interaction.
Have someone who will lead each meeting, monitor chats and monitor the list of speakers, and help you take notes (or take notes in collaboration).
If you need a comfortable headset, email tech support.
Use your insurance premiums for claims.
Join the #remoties site to discuss distributed jobs with your colleagues
The Human Resources team is looking for ways to manage the increasingly distributed workload within the foundation by providing webinar-based ergonomics guidance.
Last week, we asked community donors to cancel Wikimedia fundraising events, which are like editorials, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We understand that requesting cancellation may make it difficult to fulfill previously agreed aid agreements, and no one will be penalized for delay or change in these goals.
We will be doing more guideline vaccinations at Wikimania and other regional and limited community conferences next week.
The international community's reaction is not only sadness but relief from the uncertainty caused by their sharp focus on their own community, Wikimedia and others.
Speaking of the future, CRT is working on a page on Meta-Wiki, with the goal of keeping the pressure on the community and keeping us connected.
Keeping a close eye on COVID-19-related issues
We are sending out invitations to a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We use this time to share more new information, answer your questions and spend time on our communication.
we are in this together and we help each other in any way we can.
At this time, you can access information from this email and others related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT refreshes these pages to keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain ongoing contact with workers, particularly those working in the most affected countries.
If you need assistance with travel, circumstances, a major line of work or coverage challenge, or any other matter, please do not hesitate to notify and work with CRT.
we are here to provide support and execute as needed.
If you have a matter that requires a secret wine to be handled with care, email Bryan Judan - Director of Human Resources Worldwide Operations.
none of these changes should be seen as a loss of jobs.
but this time, it is a recognition that our work and responsibilities must be adjusted in ways we have never seen before.
supporting one another is part of the process we need to take to continue working together, supporting our activities, and providing the services that sustain our world.
our planned work will be waiting for us at the right time.
For now, it is time to support one another and create space for critical work in the coming weeks and months.
you are all vital to making this happen, and we want you all to protect yourselves and your families so that we can be better off when it does.
Now please - wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine is the head of CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) is an enzyme found on the outer membrane of cells in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 is a promising drug target for treating vascular disease by inhibiting the activity of the related angotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the level of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7). ACE2 serves as an entry point for some coronaviruses into cells.
The enzyme in humans is often referred to as hACE2.
Angostin-enzyme 2 is an iron-containing zinc enzyme found on the surface of endothelial and other tissues.
The ACE2 protein is assigned the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a type I membrane that is once infectious, and the enzyme has an active domain and is found on the surface of the lungs and other internal organs.
The outer part of ACE2 is cut from the inner part of the cell by another enzyme called shadas, and the resulting protein is released into the bloodstream and finally into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is primarily found in lung type II alveolar cells, small intestine, vascular and vascular cells, and smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to be a relative balance for ACE.
ACE is a hormone that converts angiotensin I into vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 also cuts the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) in the spleen and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotestin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also inhibit [des-arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin, among many other peptides.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19, which is known to be involved in heart attack.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the S1 cell-specific proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 bind to the ACE2 enzyme domain of cells and allow the virus and enzymes to be transported to and from the endosomes in cells.
This entry process also requires the pre-testing of the S protein on the host seminal processor TMPRSS2, which is currently a research-based drug.This has led some to speculate that it may help fight infection by reducing ACE2 levels in cells.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing regular treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, showed that the use of ACE inhibitors had a 34% decreased incidence of pneumonia compared to controls.
In addition, the risk of pneumonia was similar in patients treated with ACE influenza with a high risk of pneumonia, especially in brain and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also used in relation to pneumonia-related deaths, with the results being lower than the overall risk of pneumonia.
Human ACE2 (rhACE2) cell is thought to be a novel treatment for acute pulmonary disease, which is a liposaccharide-induced respiratory syndrome that improves pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygenation in piglets.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour active (duration).
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for patients with or with elevated circulating angiotensin II with classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors).
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to help track or locate the identification process of people (contacts) who may have been in contact with an infected individual.
In some government departments and states, many applications have been prepared or submitted with the help of official government funding.
Several frameworks have been developed to build contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially regarding systems based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Options for low interference include using Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would work together to coordinate the functions of Bluetooth-powered devices into Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has developed a mobile app that will let citizens know if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community and released as open source and is provided to the government.The province of North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called StopKorona! to monitor exposure and respond quickly to people infected.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app is awaiting approval to be placed on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government announced that the contact-search app is in the advanced stage of development. "A similar app is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid"), which will also be launched in a matter of weeks".
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia plans to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow to prevent them from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, lists a number of problems, including false positives that can be applied to application-based systems and whether the adoption of the app is limited to a small segment of the population.
"To address concerns about the spread of malicious or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on which types of businesses can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, limiting them to only Facebook or well-known companies".
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the implications of widespread surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially that the intelligence infrastructure created to combat the global coronavirus pandemic will collapse once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for a ban on such surveillance.
The organizations have announced eight prerequisites for government projects:
supervision should be legal, necessary and affordable;
The lengths of control and monitoring should be in parentheses;
The use of information should be limited to COVID-19 purposes only;
information security and anonymity should be protected and evidenced;
Digital surveillance should avoid promoting bias and bias;
any sharing of information with third parties must be legally specified;
there should be safeguards to prevent unfair competition and violations of citizens' rights;
"Significant participation" is needed by "all relevant stakeholders", including public health professionals and a structured team. The German Keus Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also provided checklists".
If the Google/Apple plan is not necessary to address the ongoing surveillance problem, it is possible to remove the monitoring method from their platforms.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the ability to download apps and opt out of tracking.
In Israel, network-based surveillance is approved.
Web-based solutions for accessing data in dry environments have potential problems.
However, not all systems with a central server need to have access to private location data; several privacy-preserving systems have been developed that use central servers for communication only (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app system was used to perform contact searches.
The system combines the collection of tracking data from various sources, including mobile device tracking and card transaction data, with the delivery of text messages to these infected individuals, rather than using a dedicated application.
In addition to using this information, the government has made location data available to anyone, due to significant changes in data privacy laws in that country due to the MERS outbreak.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries including Germany have considered using central and personal protection systems.
As of 62020 April, the details have not yet been released.
The idea of respecting privacy and tracking connections was a prior idea with a long history of human search, dating back to at least 2013.On April 7, 2020, they were using a privacy-respecting solution, a Bluetooth Low Power (BLE) solution that lets them know how close they were to other phones.
However, PPP-PT is a collaborative alliance that includes both centralized and decentralized approaches and a single protocol, including the District-specified Integrated Protocols for Privacy Protection Near-Distance Search (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, FKA Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Confidentiality Protocols and Search for Mobile Communications (PACT) and others.
Personal data identified in these protocols will not leave the device, and all relevant data will be applied to the device.
The privacy team at the MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that uses privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or cross-roads data to track the spread of COVID-19.
""Apps Gone Rogue is based on a paper titled: Protecting Individuals' Privacy in a Pandemic released on March 8, 2020. Another similar effort was the SafeTrace platform, established at the MIT Media Lab by the privacy technology company Enma MPC".
SafeTrace is a secure hardware technology that allows users to share confidential locations and health information with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of their data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Coordination was formed with a group of groups that basically follow the same approach and mainly combine protocols to reduce the gap and enable universal connectivity of monitoring and alerting applications.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the roll-out of the BlueTrace protocol used by the official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a communications initiative that they said would protect privacy based on a combination of low-power technology and privacy-protecting databases.
They also released details of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be released in three stages:
List of tools that allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps
Google and Apple plan to simplify this function directly into iOS and Android integration and eliminate ongoing monitoring issues by first distributing operating system updates to the system in the same way after the threat has passed.
A drug reformulation (also known as drug re-engineering, re-dissemination, re-engineering, or therapeutic switch) is a drug that is authorized to be replicated for a different approved drug than the one that was previously developed.
This is one line of scientific research currently underway to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include COVID-19 vaccines and plasma transplants. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 potential drug proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Testing these critical sites involves providing a reasonably effective antiviral drug for COVID-19 proteins.
The most important targets of SARS-CoV-2 are proteins such as papine; RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; helixis; S-protein and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A, et al. studied several candidate compounds and then compared and analyzed them with high-quality approved drugs to accelerate the development of a stronger anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug that would be recommended for clinical trials.
chloroquine is an antimalarial drug used to prevent certain body diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization classified chloroquine and related hydrochlororoquine as one of four drugs under collaborative clinical trials.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York State trial of chloroquine and hydrochlorothrin will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydrochlorothrin sulfate and chloroxine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (USAA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA in clinical trials and is only authorized for use as an emergency treatment in the European Union for patients who are hospitalized but cannot access treatment in clinical trials.
According to the CDC, the use, dosage and timing of hydroxychloroquine for proplaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been determined.
"Doctors said they would use the drug only if there was ""no other option"".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in conjunction with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial of the use and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for prevention.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen show favipiravir to be clearly effective.
35 patients in Shenzhen had negative test results in 4 days on average, compared to 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the duration of the illness.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the current evidence for the treatment support was very limited and preliminary.
On 2 april, germany announced that it would buy the drug from japan and use its armed forces to deliver the drug to university hospitals for use in treating covid-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe said he would buy the drug to support the Trump administration.
it may not be safe for use by pregnant women or people trying to conceive.
"A study of an antiviral combination lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra) concluded that ""no benefit was found"".
The drugs were designed to prevent HIV from spreading by binding to the prostate.
Research teams at the University of Colorado are developing drugs to try to create a compound that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is much criticism in the scientific community for wasting inputs to replace drugs designed for HIV/AIDS.
The world health organization tested lopinvir in a collaborative international trial.
Remdesivir is a highly active agent in the treatment of infections caused by the Ebola virus. Gilead Sciences has subsequently identified the potential for remdesivir to be antiviral in vitro, in many phyllo-, pneumovirus-, parmixo- and coronaviruses.
One issue of antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause more serious disease and transmission.

The main objectives of the platform, which has been upgraded to Phase I safety studies, include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I promoter and vaccine recruitment: cancinobiologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
In April, scientists reported that 115 vaccine candidates in total were in the early stages of development, 78 of which were active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute data), while 37 others were announced, but it is estimated that there is little information available to the public (in the planning or design stage).
Phase I-II trials conduct a first and safe immunoassay, typically randomized, site-controlled, and multi-site based, to determine a more accurate and effective dose.
Phase III trials involve additional participants, including control groups, the effectiveness of the drug in preventing disease, and the administration of a moderate dose of a negative result.
Of the 79 vaccine trials under development (as confirmed in April 2020), 74 have not been tested on humans (still in preclinical trials).

Research studying the effectiveness of vaccines in animal models associated with COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and other nonhuman rats, suggests that time is needed to use stage 3 biosafety viruses and international cooperation to implement standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there is no known cure or vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing novel vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
At the time of the outbreak of MERS, it was believed that current SARS research would provide a useful benchmark for developing a vaccine and a treatment for MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine had completed phase-in clinical trials in humans, and three others were in the process, all virus-containing vaccines, two equivalent-based (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have raised conspiracy theories that the virus is behind COVID-19 and the idea that a known and already available vaccine exists.
Articles on various social media sites mention that the company has patented genes and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The time period from the onset of symptoms to five days can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases cause mild symptoms, some improvements have been reported in viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from more than 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered from the disease. The virus is mainly transmitted from person to person during contact, usually through coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
these droplets are produced by inhalation and usually fall to the ground or a body rather than being transmitted over long distances.
People can also measure by touching contaminated soil and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on dry surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after onset of symptoms, although it can be transmitted before symptoms appear and later in the spread stages of the disease (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal infusion.
people suspected of having the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.
Recommendations for mask use for the general population may vary, with some authorities recommending their use, others recommending their use, and others demanding their use.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The disease has been locally reported in most of all six WHO regions.
people infected with the virus may have flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, chronic chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and facial or lip discoloration.
Often, upper respiratory symptoms are seen as sneezing, a sore nose or throat.
symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, were reported in varying percentages.
In china, some cases were initially reported only for breast implants and disabilities.
in some, the disease can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
this is called the time until symptoms appear.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of the date of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully understood, but preliminary evidence suggests they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The number of asymptomatic cases is currently unknown and under study, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20 percent of confirmed cases go undiagnosed during their hospital stay.
The National Health Commission of China included initial cases, including individual cases, in the cases on April 1. Of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were identical at the time of testing.
Both acta and marak can carry large virus loads.
speaking out loud produces more droplets than speaking normally.
a study in singapore found that an uncovered cough can cause droplets to travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has found that bioaerosols can be transmitted and that air collectors test positive for viral RNA in the airway outside human rooms.
some medical procedures, such as cupping and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr), can allow respiratory secretions to be absorbed into the air and spread through the airways.
Although there is a risk of transmission through measles, the risk is thought to be low. The virus is highly contagious when people show symptoms.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, the virus was found in cardboard, plastic (polyvinyl chloride) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to one day and up to 99% copper for up to four hours.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used correctly.Soap products degrade, destroy, and free viral fat from the skin and other objects.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate (a surgical inhibitor) are not effective.In a Hong Kong study, medium-range samples were taken two days after the start of hospital treatment.
The first of five of the six patients showed the highest viral load, while the sixth showed the highest viral load on the second day the patient was tested.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan in three people with severe respiratory syndrome associated with pneumonia.
All of the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which breaks down the immune membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most vulnerable organ in COVID-19, as the virus reaches host cells through the enzyme agonist enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in the II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special layer/glyoprotein called a "stimulator" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart failure is very common in 12 percent of patients admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high during the progression of the disease due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system problems, but severe myocardial damage is associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
In patients with ECI with COVID-19 infections, elevated arteriosclerosis (31%) and hormone replacement therapy (25%) were found and may be associated with post-prostate cancer.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a specificity for respiratory cells that express ACE2 to express respiratory, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hypertensive symptoms.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells have been shown to be associated with the induction of In-6 secretory mutations in mononucleotides and the development of severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
lymphocytic infections have also been reported in autopsies.
The World Health Organization has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is instant-repeat polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is performed on breath samples taken with a nasopharyngeal swab. However, a nasal swab or acta sample may also be used.
The results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples separated by two weeks and the results are of little value.
Chinese scientists have identified the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence, allowing laboratories around the world to independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infections.
Since 4 April 2020, antiviral tests (which can detect active infections and if a person has previously been infected) have been in development, but are not yet widely used.
Chinese experience in testing shows that it is only 60 to 70% accurate.
The US FDA approved the test for initial-care-diagnosis on March 21, 2020. The test guidelines released by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggested methods to help identify infections based on clinical characteristics and influenza risk.
Dual multi-storey floor-glass spaces with back, origin and back spread are common with previous infection.
Sub-extensive dominance, manic inflammation (for lobelar septal thickness with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may be seen as the disease progresses.
There is little information available about the processes of small lesions and changes in COVID-19 disease.
Major findings of autopsy pathology:
Macrococcy-pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism and pneumonia
Four types of viral pneumonia can be identified:
Mild pneumonia: pneumonia, hyperplasia of the lungs, worm-borne diseases, lymphoma and the formation of a large mass of tissue in the center
Severe pneumonia: alveolar damage (DAD) is transmitted with widespread alveolar oxidation.
DAD is a cause of severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoemia.
Treatment of pneumonia: Exposes in the central fibrosis between the alveolar sinuses and the lungs
Blood: circulating intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic response
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding crowded areas, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a cloth when sneezing or coughing and using the inside of the ear if there is no cloth.
proper hand hygiene is recommended after any coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings to limit transmission if a person is a carrier of the disease. Social distancing strategies are a strategy to help reduce contact with infected people in large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large public gatherings.
Distance guidelines also include keeping people at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.
"There is no known effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19. " As a vaccine is not expected until 2021, a key part of COVID-19 management is trying to slow the spread of the disease, known as ""slowing the spread of the virus"".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are obviously dirty, before touching the nose and before sneezing or before and after eating.
The WHO recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol only when soap and water are not readily available. In areas where hand sanitizers are not available on the market, WHO has recommended two formulas for local production.
in these formulations, the antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used in alcohol to remove bacterial growths; it is not an active ingredient in hand antiseptics.
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People apply for financial aid, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other vital organs and support for those affected.
The CDC recommends that people who believe they may have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Efroaclar membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory problems, but benefits are still being seen.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease.The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for caring for people hospitalized in COVID-19.
intensive care physicians and respiratory specialists in the united states have complied with medical advice from various agencies to use the independent source of information ibbc.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For diagnoses, some medical professionals recommend using paptamol (acumulonic acid) with ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of virus transmission when performing ventilation procedures such as inhalation or hand ventilation.
Health care professionals caring for people with COVID-19 recommend that the person be placed in an airborne infection escape unit (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, precautions, and ventilation precautions.The CDC lists guidelines for using personal protective equipment during an outbreak.
Recommended gear: PPE clothing, respirator or face shield, eye protection and medical gloves. When available, respirators (rather than face coverings) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings but the FDA has approved them as masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but efficacy on a particular biological agent is not guaranteed for use outside of the product specification.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face coverings or as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most COVID-19 injuries are not as severe as requiring mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but minor injuries are severe.
The type of respiratory system for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory problems is being actively studied for people in the hospital, where the pain can be alleviated by high nasal flow or two-stage positive airway pressure.
it is not known whether either of these two drugs has the same benefit for chronic disease.
Some doctors prefer to use assisted mechanical ventilation in the presence of some doctors, as it restricts the circulation of airborne particles compared to a higher nasal discharge.
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which has limited the health system's ability to cope with the sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygen becomes more difficult to obtain.
Air compressors that increase air pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to increase oxygen supply while reducing the risk of respiratory-related lung injury and pneumonia.
High PEEP may not be present on older air ventilators.
A study to find potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems very promising.
Although it may take until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the drugs under investigation are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe illness.
The World Health Organization recommends that volunteers participate in efficacy and safety trials of potentially effective treatments.The FDA has granted temporary permission for FDA testing when an individual's life is in serious or immediate danger.
It has not reviewed the clinical studies needed to prove that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can use sensory information to detect 'close contact', thus identifying the risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a threat is detected, the app will not only alert local health authorities to self-isolation, but also to facial data analysis on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track and track infected people.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to monitor mobile phone data of people suspected of contracting the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to identify and protect those who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared data on the robust location of its phones with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to identify those escaping from detention.
Italy's regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile phone operators had reported that 40 percent of people were still moving in any way.
The German government conducted a 48-hour study on more than 42,000 participants over the weekend.
Also, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called for global innovation to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
individuals may face isolation, travel restrictions, side effects of medical treatment, or the risk of infection.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "Social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic collapse are the perfect storm that is affecting people's mental health and wellbeing".
The symptoms may be mild with few or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory illnesses, such as the common cold.
mild cases usually recover in two weeks, but those with severe or severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe infections with COVID-19, but there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by infecting the lungs.
In severely affected individuals, COVID-19 can rapidly lead to respiratory distress, extinction shock, or multi-organ failure to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, unhealthy gastrointestinal tract, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Unhealthy outcomes, especially increased prostate duration, were seen in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, and abnormal kidney function was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with COVID-19 show elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the first symptoms and death was ten days, including five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time between hospitalization and death of seven days.
Studies in previous cases have ranged from six to 41 days in the case of early symptoms to death in about 14 days.
A study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) showed a 2.8% increase in male deaths and 1.7% in female deaths.
A postmortem examination of lung samples shows damage to both lungs by alveolar carcinoma exposed to mobile fibroxide.
viral cytopathological changes have been observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung image appears to be from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of all deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart disease was reported as a severe ruponin or heart failure.
According to data from the United States in March, 89 percent of those hospitalized had pre-existing conditions.
the circumstances of death vary because of these regional differences, but may also be due to strategic problems.
small errors can lead to a large death toll.
However, the current death rate is estimated to be lower because deaths are caused by previously treated cases.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and require intensive care, or about 2.4 times more than smokers.
Hong Kong hospital authorities confirmed that some people who recovered from the disease had a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity, and that organ damage was detected on a scan.
This can lead to post-extreme monitoring symptoms after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is unknown whether past infections provide an effective and long-term chance of resistance in people recovering from the disease.
The incidence of the disease is seen to be decreasing based on the characteristics of other coronaviruses, but there have been reports of positive tests for the coronavirus after later recovery from COVID-19.
these cases are thought to worsen the disease progression rather than recover.
The virus is thought to be of natural and animal origin through a naturally occurring and exacerbated infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection will be fully human-to-human.
The first 41 confirmed studies of COVID-19 published in Lanet in January 2020 indicate that the onset of symptoms is on December 1, 2019.
The World Health Organization reported the first symptoms of the disease on December 8, 2019.
various measures have been taken to measure the death rate.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by test volume, quality of healthcare system, treatment options, early outbreak, and community characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the ICD-10 assigned emergency disease codes U07.1 to laboratory-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 deaths and U07.2 to COVID-19 diagnoses for clinical or related illnesses without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 disease.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate as of 17 April 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who have died from the disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people who have died from the disease (treated and untreated).
And these statistics are not held for a specific time period until they exclude certain people from the vaccine.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information on how many people are infected.
80 (1.7%) people have died in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people at the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread through carnival celebrations, and with relatively few deaths, it spread to young people, so all COVID-19 deaths may not be formally classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overwhelmed.
It is estimated that only 3% of blood donors in the Netherlands may have antibodies.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
In studies in china and italy, the death rate is higher.
The greatest risk for men is in their 50s, with the gap between men and women only approaching 90.
In china, the male mortality rate was 2.8 percent and the female mortality rate was 1.7 percent.
the exact causes of this gender difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
gender-based diseases, smoking may be a factor in higher mortality rates in men than in women, such as low blood pressure.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government was not monitoring sexual-related data related to COVID-19 infections.
studies show that men and women are affected differently by diseases such as ebola, hiv, influenza and sars.
a large number of health workers, especially nurses, are women and are at high risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization on 11 February 2020 will change the official name of the disease to COVID-19.
According to WHO Director-General Theodros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the coronavirus, the virus that causes disease and infection, was first identified in 19 people when the disease was first identified: December 31, 2019.
In order to avoid discrimination, the name was chosen to exclude the presence of a specific geographic area (e.g., China), animal species, or group of people, in line with international recommendations. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization also uses the terms COVID-19 virus and the virus that causes COVID-19 in public media.
"the disease and virus are commonly referred to as ""coronavirus""".
The virus and disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus when it was first reported in Wuhan, China.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended that the names 2020-nCov and 2019-nCoV for acute respiratory illness should be used as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 guidelines on the use of spaces in the virus and virus names.
The names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were named on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in traditional supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare products such as nasal swabs and ventilation units.
In one example, an Italian hospital urgently needed an air-conditioning valve and the supplier was able to provide it in the required amount of time, while a local startup Blast-Nurse printed 100 valves a day that a nurse needed overnight.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, information on the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and its spread has spread rapidly on the Internet.
humans seem to have the ability to spread the virus to other animals.
The study found no evidence of virus transmission in pigs, ducks and chickens.
there is no cure or vaccine for the disease.
Global research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization established the Solidarity Experiment to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral chemicals with the promise of great effectiveness.
There is no vaccine, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have both been used in the past by SARS-CoV as they both use ACE2 receptor receptors to enter cells.
There are three vaccination methods under investigation.
first, researchers aim to develop a general antiviral vaccine.
The use of this variant of the virus, whether active or dead, is to improve the immune system's ability to respond to new COVID-19 exposures.
The second strategy is sub-vaccination, which aims to develop a vaccine that tracks the immune system of specific sub-components of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focused on an S-spike protein that helps the virus target the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third method is nucleic acid vaccines (a new method for creating a vaccine using DNA or RNA vaccines).
In these approaches, experimental vaccines must be tested for safety and efficacy.The first clinical trial of the vaccine began on March 16, 2020, in Seattle with four volunteers.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. It has been proposed as a vulnerable antibody-dependent development for SARS-COV-2 vaccine preparation, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
seven were reviewing previously approved treatments for malaria, including four approved studies of hydrochlorothiazines or chloroquine.
Most of the reusable antiviral drugs are under Chinese research, reported in late April in nine Chapter III trials in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical progress for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates has been conducted.Many existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 including reflovir, chloroquine and hydrochlorothiazin, lopeavia/rutanvir and lopenavir/rudonavir in combination with interferon beta.
There is concrete evidence of the effectiveness of the price reduction as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement was seen in patients treated with compassion-use therapy.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was first studied in China in February 2020.
However, there have been calls for peer review of research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology suggests that while one gram a day is recommended, twice that amount can be dangerous and fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the Choice of Physicians treating people with COVID-19 issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.The 7th edition of Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umfenovirine for COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high levels of ribavirin are necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for use as an additive in vivo studies after it showed low pressure concentrations for SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that high protein consumption of the trans-tissue protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Cloroquine and hydrochlorocurine have major limitations that studies with or without arthromycin will find the medical community unable to treat these treatments without further research.Oseltamivir does not inherit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytoquin storms can be complex in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine wave properties. Tocilizumab was included in the medical guidelines of the National Health Commission of China after completing a small study.
After showing good results in people with severe disease, a nationwide Phase 2 randomized trial is underway in Italy.
Combined with a serum Frittostatin blood test to detect a wave of nicotine, it is intended to counteract such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in those affected.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist is relatively new in CAR T cell therapy, and was approved by the FDA based on studies based on the response to treatment of steroidal reversible etotoxin release syndrome published in 2017.
To date, there is no controlled, randomized data that tokylase is an effective treatment for CRS.
The immune cells created by people recovering from COVID-19 are being investigated as a recommended method of vaccination for people who need filtered and stored antibodies.
This strategy has led to unconvincing results for the SARS experience.
Viral neutralization/control is a deliberate measure that can act as a defense medium against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other strategies such as anti-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or fungotomy are possible.
Other indirect antibody therapies, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are rare.
the production of sick spleen, a component of the bloodstream of patients recovering from infection, which contains antibodies specific to the virus, may be increased to deploy more quickly.
