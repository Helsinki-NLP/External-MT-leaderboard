This not only confirms the fact that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as their colors and three-dimensional layouts.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown on top with a pale underside or carotenoid color.
The discovery also provides a first glimpse into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a highly developed structure, called a rachis, but instead have other features of feathers  barbels and barbels  the researchers deduced that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but for temperature regulation or visualization. The researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the scapula shows an adult plumage rather than a plumage.
The researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the scapular shows adult plumage and no chicken feathers.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey early on Monday, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

They found that the Sun operated on the same basic principles as the other stars: It was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system was conditioned by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to the magnetic inversions.

The work done was essentially theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal force between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a similar force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of corona, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have picked up the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two of them were health workers at the hospital.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After verification by officials of the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the list of electors.
French electoral law codifies rather strictly the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no ballot envelope was present at the start of voting and that no ballot envelope was added without those voters being duly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to be witnesses to the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

Four female skiers from the women's group failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer".
The accused are designated under the names Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of his son.
She is detained pending her indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence can be compromised by the fact that her image has been widely published.
It is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom but the Scottish judiciary operates differently and courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee remarks "journalists really seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos etc of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is generally concerned with actions in justice, has advised the newspapers that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will address the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on those before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that would have been addressed include the future status of Jerusalem as sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years by which an agreement will be signed while the PA agrees to leave such a presence only for five years.
The shooters of the supplementary population control experiment were to be closely monitored by the guards, provided that the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the interim director of conservation and heritage for the park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received complete safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in before a new provisional electoral council (CEC) of nine members later.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP leader as part of a package of measures that will lead the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread demonstrations against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some due since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating from malfunctioning iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been made aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable".
The Mariana earthquake struck at 7:19 am local time (9:19 pm GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Agency stated that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer holds Hong Kong tourists hostage after he crashed their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly persons, were immediately released, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the commons.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature labour in her spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered it would accelerate the fetal lung of the infant.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders from the 'black box' on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Moon was the first queen of Extreme. My first mistress. Moon has crossed the night of the two moons. She is truly unique just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as troubled as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard has claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the poll, 29 per cent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent of them believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his injuries, his fitness has been called into question.
He was unable to take the medication needed to relieve his pain as it was forbidden by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri has discovered the largest prime number to date, the 25th of January.
Several people verified the discovery using computer hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of the water supply to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political blah blah and stupidity".
He is speculated to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radars to allow air traffic controllers to determine the position of an aircraft with greater accuracy and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided and the overhead trains will not stop at Wembley and parking and relay parking facilities are unavailable on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that he would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of birds on the equatorial islands of the Galápagos.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take longer, due to cross-breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza forte, and the finch of the immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to become a fine thread, which can be twisted and spun. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and embedded in another metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
You can make an indicator using red clover juice.
The juice of cauliflower changes color depending on the degree of acidity or base (alkaline) of the chemical product.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical product being tested.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have their protons derived from them (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, boil them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will make you feel a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The villages of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had water-powered communes in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated roof system.
Remains of roof systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan villages of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also communes in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, the communes were sometimes a part of the houses of public baths where men and women were gathered in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere shapes some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to lift a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us a much easier and faster means of transportation.
We have taken the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including stray domestic cats) that eat the most numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the capelette, a special job that each cat has and that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of the felines, living in large, well-developed groups called herds.
Lions' packs are composed of one to three adult males of the same family, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act as herds of wolves or cubs, animals that are remarkably similar to lions (but not other felines) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances and do a traction five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's loud roar, but rather like a phrase of unspoken and uttered words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, and can and will eat monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, although most animals that they hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the birds follow and find animals to eat (catch) by their scent, narrating their passage on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as crossing a mountain range or a river, or moving to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and rivals, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, and still requires the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants draw their nutrients from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the most important predator in its day, and therefore feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long tusks were equipped with over 70 razor-shaped teeth, along with an extra string in the roof of its mouth, meaning it had no way of escaping from anything that came its way.
Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is possible that they were once a cannibal.
It also attacked everything in the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex could not have been strong enough to fight it.
And while most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual celebration elements, which included wild boars, peacocks, cockroaches, and a type of rodent called a missara.
Another difference was that in the past the poor and women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to make mass banquets where they were scattered on the side while eating their meals.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have bought food that would have arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a pitcher.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only open shelves that they gave to the street. The stone was used to build the houses.
There were no major forests in the land of Canaan, and therefore timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. It is said in Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for a murder and, when he travelled further west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But beyond its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you may think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. And even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, this large document and parchment (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped for safekeeping.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The landings of D-Day, and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the French of "Vichy", who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being dubbed "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American forces and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large and significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, a cognate of Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also defined in some ways the dimension of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilization culture implies the passing of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural weight and an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government - with Congress as its sole constituent - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the powers to impose taxes, and, since it had no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its decisions.
He also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took over the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful football team in the world and were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the island chain that Japan has, Japan is often called, from a geographical point of view, an "archipel"
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the coastal regions of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of still image photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image-capture formats of numerical photographic equipment.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat surprisingly, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is frequently abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while preserving a measure of order in an image.
He states that the most effective angle for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal parts (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had bound together European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from king to villain.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church are specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade had violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent all ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing dangers to neutral ships.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his patron in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing the different periods of time; each stage of China or each ruling family represented a distinct dynasty.
There were also periods of instability between each dynasty, with provinces divided into provinces. The most notable of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods a fierce war raged between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest seat in the great palace at Xian.
There are many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates allowing the most ambitious and brilliant to succeed.
The same is true for the military because instead of having army ranks based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the repressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to attend a ball that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (the light) for contemplation.
The shroud itself, which has survived to the present day, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if one knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Not much of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khofo and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khofo's wives and family members.
The "high arrow" looks like a V and the "low arrow" looks like a graph or a square that lacks a bottom.
Up means you should start at the punch and push the bow, and down means you should start at the hook (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A high bow usually generates a softer sound, while a low bow is louder and more assertive.
You should feel free to make your own mark with a frog, but remember that printed marks are there for a musical reason, so they should be generally respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, aged 11 and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were sent back from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789 by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob that shouted and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to have their eyes wide open.
At one moment a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in the face of the terrorized queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were required to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to repay a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Indeed, the superprofits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipinos would constitute the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The period during which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological imperative or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a suspicious logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes well beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn "effects" on societies that are inherent in, rather than socially conditioned by, them.
For example, it could be argued that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, and new methods of production are therefore developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new sleeping techniques to repair bodily injuries.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was perceived as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the crusaders were returning with gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets were offering.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of capital of fashion from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic architecture reached its height during the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west could be traced back 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of this era was that as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to open up clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is conducted for the production of food sufficient to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological, system using stored seeds originating from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically many peasants were engaged in subsistence agriculture and it is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which may include fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most frequently used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misbehavior or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their formative years.
Such children are called "wild" or "savage". Some wild children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, such abandonment of children was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that wild children may have suffered violence or severe trauma during their childhood before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are believed to have been abducted by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When fully embraced by nonhuman animals, the feral child manifests behaviors (within its physical limits) almost completely similar to those of the particular adopting animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
And while project-based learning should be the easiest and most interesting learning, the point goes one step further.
The Empath is not a learning method but rather a help that provides support to individuals experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Exhibits can be both virtual and real, that is, a teacher is a form of exhibit but is also the case for the Microsoft Office thumbnail man.
Virtual Points are internalized within the logic and serve to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been too complex for the student to manipulate on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, to extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring staff, a stable education and reliable health care.
Host families are supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the hostels from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and benefits.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting his microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who were unable to understand speech because of brain damage were nevertheless able to estimate sincerity with precision.
It also suggests that some of these capacities for interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two sources of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reservoir of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination combine variation in both directions between all two reservoirs in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its needs for amino acids from the resources available in plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth disturbances, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins accessible in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
By contrast, animal foods (ant, chicken, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide large amounts of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively discreet alarm to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to wake it up.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is in direct correlation with the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were spread by the Mahāyāna path of love and by the technical forces of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is developed through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of divinity. Through the visualization of various divinities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. After the end of the war, the confrontation of systems, processes and culture led to a break between these countries.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move its people and its goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and its goods.
One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which used mostly U-boats, was trying to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, furs, meat, and fur.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pasturage, often tended by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more commonly known shepherds. These pastoral methods are still employed today.
Hippo-mobile railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the rails of the hippo-mobile consisted of only parallel timber posts, they allowed horses to pull at higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
The traverse was introduced early enough to keep the railings in place. However, it was realized that the tracks would be more effective if there was an iron rail above them.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means erect man).
In their early years, australopithecines did not walk upright as they usually do.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become more activist in order to reduce future suffering to some degree.
It's not just as symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we want only a temporary solution, then we would have to find the root of the problems, and we would have to deactivate them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and the problems have been made worse by the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap sheets".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One of these was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July, and another reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving examples of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. They are birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still relate to dinosaurs.
They have feet with shoes and boots, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal contamination may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic chemicals in the home.
You should check the label for the specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with the wasps, which are highly adapted insects to parasitize humans.
The killer whale and killer whale are both nesting birds, adapted to live in a nest or the lodging of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the predominant neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in their child's best interest, to abort a baby.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents put an end to their parental rights so that another couple can become parents to the child.
The primary goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the scientific method, which actually drives most scientific research.
However, it is not all experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations that guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external signals, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by tagging either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the amount of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of taking advantage of the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example is to visit, photograph, and learn about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they just left from.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has stripped the biosphere of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and most people complain about transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about the quality of the water or the bridges that they build.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they not function properly on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Thus, conductors tend to behave in a reasonably consistent manner; whereas, circulation currents tend to have some consistency and can be mathematically represented in an approximate manner.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take off. Their ability to fly helped them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small holes to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and aphids.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
It seems strange, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the longest river on Earth, sometimes as much as six kilometres wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were admiring the monuments of their predecessors, which were much older than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday life for most of those who work in the state while Latin is often employed in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since Antiquity, though they can all be found in nature in their native forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was also theorized that the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, also change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. You should remember that there are still elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
It may also have alloys containing trace amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the punch at the end of this sentence.
So the greedon was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing methods, the gredon was relegated to a lesser status and jobs.
People now write messages on computers or computer screens, without ever having to deal with a hack.
One can only ask that the keyboard be sent when something new arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to knock out a nucleus and force protons and neutrons together.
It's a little like rolling a heavy truck over a hill, and then fractionally releasing the nucleus and then some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to separate with a small push or even less.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the opposite side.
It is more deep-sea and more dense than the highlands.
There may be more marshes on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people choose or what is of interest to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized from the time they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what motivates certain people to envy the things they do and what things in their environment will or will not make them do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when directors start taking their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to stay "one of the guys" (or women).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, exercising disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, another becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and own it.
Ultimately, the manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of his team.
This behaviour often results in friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members since their teams can meet in variable time zones that may not be covered by their local administration.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the rules for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the laborious process of building a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals when implementing organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of the client.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and both shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the continuum approach as a method that is used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, thus limiting the scope of research and making it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior validates the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has strong connotations of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnostics and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such issues have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The DIA system is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been built into various computer applications and home video games.
Field trips are an important part of all classes. Often a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual excursions. Students can visit museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also an excellent way to discuss an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is remodeled, but older versions are kept online as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with a neglected grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to make valiant efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging "obliges students to become more aware of the world around them than the world around them". The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Using a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school days.
Proper use of blogs "can stimulate students to become more analytical and critical; through active responses to Internet material, students can define their own positions in the context of others' writings as well as highlight their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's bilingual capital city and has a good network of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is much further south and the north is the untapped natural beauty region of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more still put Ontario's value in what is considered the quintessential Canadian forests.
The larger expanses further north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness regions.
To make a population comparison that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent alone in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the territories, and it was established in a significant way in the Comoros and the Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began during the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope route to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that all female travellers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what may be considered harassment and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
You have to be firm when you reject men, and don't be afraid to defend the territory (cultural differences or not, that's not normal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meronids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1775.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajinas, pottery, leather goods, nargles, and a whole range of tacos, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the far east coast of Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma must be studied to understand the state of the fighting that is ongoing in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for the ascent of Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the least expensive mountain gorilla tracks in Africa.
A boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) can be used to make the round trip from Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be employed as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a bustling city, although its reputation as a tourist attraction has been eroded, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages during the special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entry fees for the park.
It can also be advantageous for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either selections of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the area that many tourists consider as their main interest.
The parade of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a bright bar chart that is made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head for the Kowloon seafront facing south.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the land that the British settlers took as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the interior of the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps but also comprise some of the last remaining patches of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 deer roaming the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, particularly those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres (226 ft), are 378 metres (1,298 ft) long and have two roads 3.50 metres (11.9 ft) wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017 when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurus and Payaguas, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
During the 16th century Paraguay, formerly called "the giant province of the Indies", was born as a result of the Spanish conquistadors' encounter with the indigenous native groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and parties can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP) which is equivalent in value to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and inside Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the subtropical regions; during the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are frequent.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the fauna is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park officials, you must keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they appear, bison, wasps, hornbills, bears, and almost any other beautiful animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking unsafe food and keep a clean field.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of an infamous naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk, except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland is sandwiched between two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch to Long Bay in the north and Devonport in the south.
Most are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most have shady locations provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburb of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are family beaches sometimes very busy with a good range of shops lined up on the coast.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to choose from, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may travel better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is a good place to go if you have any doubts.
For Australians, the concept of flat white coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is an 'espresso', the cappuccino comes fully topped with cream (no foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to schools are made throughout the year, and accidents due to these reasons on schools are rare.
However, you should take the advice of the authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The jellyfish appear near beaches and river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770, and can occasionally be found outside these times.
The lemmas exist in the wild, but rarely attack humans. Most lemmas are afraid of humans and would flee by swimming.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, and it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport, or packages that combine flights with hotel accommodation.
You can also reserve it if you need time to think about the proposal or to get other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should be notified through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to live on the site, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you will have to get up early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may have ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping trips for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes a lot of noise for the most affected people.
Cruise ships in Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check conditions).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be hard to find.
They routinely have special food and drink and entertainment proposals, to keep the customers in good spirits, and keep them in their place.
Some establishments serve alcoholic beverages instead. However, intoxication alters judgment and all good players know that it is important to stay sober.
Those who are required to drive to high latitudes or on mountain slopes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is weak and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow to immobilize you may fall in a very short time.
Visibility may also be restricted by snow falling or being carried by the wind, condensation or ice on the vehicle's windshields.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and are the strong point for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to trips by land to observe the magnificent African wildlife, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and standard equipment will allow them to be observed closely.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them better with twins.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalk, safari excursion, or footing) consists of walking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you have booked your 2020 tickets and accommodation before the announcement of the report, you may have a problem.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most cancellation policies due to coronavirus will not expire until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Most tickets for the competitions are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Weaving wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have a washer and dryer available for service, even if there are no presents in the room.
If a sanding iron is not available or you are not comfortable with sanded faucets, then you may try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
You should be careful not to let the tissue become too hot (which can cause bleeding, or in extreme cases, burnt skin).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if so, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter strange beasts that are not familiar to them in their native regions.
Sick animals can damage food, cause irritation or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Even infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people forcibly, do not fall under the category of noxious causes.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods free of taxes and special taxes in certain areas.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products such as alcoholic drinks and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated patches of forest.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep a calm mind: steep ski slopes, narrow lanes and sharp turns predominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections  frequently 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other portions of the route, for example at the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cuisine is very good, and in Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruits in the pastry are frequent, with apples cooked in pans all year round, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer.
Many German products baked in the oven also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cookies harmonize particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try the one that, depending on the region, sounds like Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on aromatic herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the proportion of liquid.
In the northern interior regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, it is coconut milk that is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian gastronomy is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found across the nation.
However, when used without any other qualifier, the term tends to mean the food that is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the island, Javanese cuisine features a variety of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors favored by Javanese are cocoa beans, peppers, sugar (particularly coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but can create safety concerns due to the potential for the rider's feet to get caught.
If a rider is ejected from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he may be robbed if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a saddle horse to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks comprise some impressive views from the summits. Climbers from all parts of the world continually establish new routes between its infinite potential walls.
Snowsports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding on snow-covered ground with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that draws large numbers of enthusiasts, known occasionally as "ski vagabonds", who plan entire holidays centered on skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  paintings in caves depicting skiers date back to as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and, in 1861, the first leisure skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski hiking: This activity is also called skiing retreats, skiing walks or skiing excursions.
It is related but usually not included with alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which is done on steep terrain and requires more rigid skis and boots.
You have to think of the ski itinerary as a similar itinerary of excursion.
In good conditions you can cover relatively greater distances than walking but very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy bag on damaged tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa requirements and passport controls many times.
The Schengen area, however, functions to some extent like a country in this case.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without passing through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured objects are antiques, and some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition is subject to geographical variations, as the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Craft products may be defined as ancient, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of income for the Sami and the culture surrounding trade is also important to many other professions.
More traditionally, not all the Sami have participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer primarily as game animals.
Today many Sami people work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami country.
Although commonly used, particularly among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advice, your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments that are not your own, but whose advice is thought by their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advice is simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Inclement weather is the generic term for any type of weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
An inclement weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many different ways, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and effects of inclement weather, as are hailstorms, tornadoes, sea storms, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of all the risks of severe weather that may affect their area as it may affect all their travel plans.
Those planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should follow professional training.
An Internet search for 'course to hostile environments' will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course should normally cover all the topics discussed here in great detail, usually with some practical experience.
A course normally lasts between 2 and 5 days and will include role-playing, many elements of first-person shooter, and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness regions are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travellers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they carry valid documents for the return trip.
Governments' willingness to issue passports with the gender not indicated (X) or documents issued to correspond to a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is simply variable everywhere.
The break-ins at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive after 9/11.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
The headwaters are the reflections of the waves that rise from the beach, often at or near a shore.
Because of the underwater topology the return flow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a fast current to deep water can be formed there.
Most deaths occur as a result of the fatigue of trying to swim to shore against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the water, swimming again is no more difficult than it used to be.
Try to steer yourself somewhere where you won't be trapped again or, depending on your abilities and if you've been spotted, you may want to wait for rescue.
Back-shock occurs earlier than culture shock (and is less than a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to their new culture have sometimes had particularly difficult times adjusting back to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your original culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
What people may not anticipate is that patience and understanding are also required for returning travelers.
The sound and light show is one of the area's most interesting attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually heard from tourists and vendors for a long time. The history of sounds and lights is simply like a book of stories.
The Sphinx serves as both a backdrop and a narrator to a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are hallucinated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and hold the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km (75 mi) north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island with the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, and then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains mountain range, cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range is the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which culminates at 4,892 m (12,960 ft) above Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you must be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that need data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel for study.
It is particularly popular among school leavers, allowing them to take a gap year before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling for a gap year in a study abroad program can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education once you return to your home country.
There will generally be tuition fees for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of islands as well, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are effectively large enough for all types of yachts, smaller vessels or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This coincides with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic Cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and sleep on the boat again at night.
If you go ashore only as part of the ship's excursions you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise lines feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and all conditions, particularly if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something we should be ashamed of: it's no different than the personal fears and aversions of other things that most people have.
For some, understanding something about how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not being able to control anything.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an emergency repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and smaller companies there is a problem.
If items are sent by air freight, on some itineraries, it may take days to get through the unloading stages and customs.
The only way to make it through the airport faster was to send it as baggage in the baggage compartment. Airline regulations will not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, who is then in the baggage compartment.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a fair amount of money for the privilege (or, even better, to have your company do it for you).
However, it is not a good bargain: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal price in economy class for business class and eleven times the normal price for first class!
In general, there is no point in seeking reductions for business class or first class seats on direct flights from point A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of dollars for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and are billed accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parties in Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The most important religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a major transportation hub.
Formerly the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and busy center of commercial operations, situated around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping malls are adorned with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century marketplace and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Øysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble carvings of doves on some of the tombs.
It's worth a half-hour's walk in this strange village.
To the north is the easily accessible and romantic and fascinating town of Sintra which was made famous by foreigners after a detailed account of its splendors was documented by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north you should also visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (holy place), a place of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are visiting primarily a site of mass graves and also a site that has almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or who worked there until their deaths, both Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not degrade the site by writing or graffitiing on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, a vast majority understands it, and virtually all speak Spanish.
However, most panels are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egotistical, impolite, and arrogant.
Although often not an accurate stereotype, the best way to get around in Paris is still to show your best behavior, by acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well educated). This will make getting around considerably easier.
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians will evaporate quickly if you show some basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, pine and fir trees, and features a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and variable altitude levels.
The forest is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, badger, lynx, iron cat and wild peacock can be found here, as well as many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are asked to wear gowns that cover the knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide women with shawls that are not prepared, but if you bring your own, particularly one with bright colors, you will receive a kiss from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same fashion, men were required to wear trousers that covered the knees.
This can also be taken from the pantry at the entrance but this suit is not washed after each use and so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all!
The Malhorch cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean expansions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (usually pork), and uses olive oil in every case.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is bread with oil: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any kind of available accompaniment such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, together with the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, and even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
Doubt makes reading easier, and even though writing is a bit complicated by the need to find out if a verb or an adjective is used in a substantiated form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to be considered are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, make sure you pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means car, while carro means car.
They have a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know some Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so close that it does not need to be studied separately.
Early modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums, or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not the type of problem that it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those that were built during the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were hosted by the emperor himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look better when they are in a natural environment, so you should resist the temptation to take just one specimen.
If you visit a formal landscaped garden, collecting a few "specimens" will also make you feel like a stranger, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to go and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you get there.
But as it is situated in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator you will have to manage both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, rarely).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
You have to check that the bus you are planning to take is going to Hebron and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good base for holidaying.
For example, visiting the castles of the Leire Valley, the Rhine Valley or going on cruises to interesting sites on the Danube or taking a boat on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holidays have also been adopted by non-Christians in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some exposed spot to watch the sun rise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may have been a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Most traditional churches celebrate a Christmas Eve Eve on the Saturday night of Easter Sunday, with some congregations beginning the celebration at the first stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands arrived either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, the mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as long as the sky is consistently dark.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to take advantage of the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The costumes are standard work clothes and colleagues are called by their family name or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with an emphasis on teamwork rather than individual performance.
Workers must often obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
