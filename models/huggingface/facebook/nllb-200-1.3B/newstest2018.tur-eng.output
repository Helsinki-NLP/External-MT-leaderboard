Last minute: our cosmic visitor is the giant asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions, perhaps more, of giant asteroids roaming the solar system that could have serious consequences if they collided.
These objects, which can have closed or open orbits left over from the formation of the Sun, sometimes pass through Earth.
The 650-meter-diameter asteroid 2014 JO25 is one such visitor, and today at 14:24 it will pass 1.75 million kilometers from its closest position to Earth.
We're hearing more and more of this kind of news every day.
The main reason for this is the advancement in observation techniques and instruments.
This allows us to detect smaller asteroids that we couldn't detect before.
For example, last January an asteroid the size of a bus passed within half the distance of Earth and the Moon.
And even more interesting, the asteroid was detected just days before the transit.
So there could be other space buses coming at us right now.
Imagine if you were told that an asteroid 20 meters in diameter was about to hit your neighborhood.
Asteroids this size won't actually destroy your neighborhood, but they'll probably blow the windows off all the buildings.
This will be due to the shock waves from the asteroid that will explode in the atmosphere.
For example, the asteroid that hit Russia in 2013 was this size, and it was enough to smash the windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you have a neighborhood within 100 meters of an asteroid, you should go at least 50 kilometers beyond your recommended neighborhood.
Criteria such as the size of the asteroid and the angle of impact are the factors that determine the depth of the crater that will form and the damage that will be caused by the impact.
Let's look at a few scenarios based on the European Space Agency's simulation.
If an asteroid 100 meters in diameter hits the Earth at a 45-degree angle, at 60 kilometers per second, it will form a crater about 250 meters deep and with an arch of 1,200 meters.
The impact is equivalent to a magnitude 6 earthquake on the Richter scale, and even if you're 10 kilometers from the point of impact, you'll have a third-degree burn.
The others, 50 kilometers away, will be waiting for broken windows.
If it hits an asteroid one kilometer in diameter, it's even more dismal.
If such an asteroid hit the Earth at the same angle and speed, it would form a crater about 600 meters deep and 12 kilometers in diameter.
So a whole neighborhood turns into a crater and disappears instantly.
The heat from the impact causes a third-degree burn to your body even if you're 100 kilometers from the point of impact.
The impact is equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 8 on the Richter scale.
The damage from the asteroid depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid but also on the rock structure of the area it will hit.
The above values are given in reference to the scenario that would occur if a rock-like asteroid fell into a region of clumpy rocks.
If the asteroid is mostly iron, and it falls on a surface formed by the cooling of lava, the crater will triple in size, and the resulting catastrophe will be doubled.
66 million years ago, the dinosaurs were hit worse, and were devastated by an asteroid about 10 kilometers across.
The asteroid impact wiped out 75 percent of all marine and land life in an instant.
If an asteroid this size is targeting Earth, which is destroying the dinosaurs, I'm sure the safest option would be to leave the planet.
Tonnes of matter falling from space to Earth every day.
Most of it burns up in the atmosphere.
Some meteorites that are large enough burn up in the atmosphere, causing flares known to the public as stellar slips.
Let's end our summer with another piece of good news.
Studies show that no massive asteroid is expected to hit Earth in the next 300 to 400 years, causing major destruction.
As creatures that live an average of 70 years, I'm sure you're relieved.
The flash bid for the medal: 10 million euros!
Gary Medel, the name on the agenda for the Black and Whites who want to reinforce the Stoper zone, is definitely considering leaving Inter...
The 30-year-old, who recently returned to Inter after wearing his Chilean Confederations Cup shirt, is awaiting offers.
Gazzetta dello Sport, a prestigious Italian newspaper, suggested that Beşiktaş had made an offer of 10 million euros to Inter for Medel, who can play both in the stop and front-free zones.
It was noted that the Black and White, who made their offer to Medel, were waiting for a response from both sides, while it was noted that the Chilean footballer looked forward to living in Istanbul with his family.
Despite this claim by the Gazzetta, it is unlikely that the Black Eagle, which is limited by FFP, will pay a price of 10 million euros for the Medal.
There's a chance the Black-Whites will add the star player to the squad if they first turn to Medel via a lease, as in Caner Erkin's transfer, or if there's a serious discount on bonuses.
Beşiktaş has announced the transfer of Negredo to the stock exchange
Human rights group issues travel advisory for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a warning for people of color to travel to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The Missouri NAACP Travel Advisory Notice, effective August 28, 2017, urges African American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to exercise extreme caution and caution when traveling statewide as noted there, due to the recent suspicious, racially-based incidents occurring statewide".
The NAACP said a new Missouri law makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and that the disproportionate targeting of minorities by state law enforcement was instrumental in the group's issuance of this travel warning.
"There are human rights violations that people have.
They're being stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their skin", Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, told the Kansas City Star.
"We're hearing complaints at a rate we've never heard before".
This is the first time the Association has issued a warning for a state in the United States.
The group cited the incidents of racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders was detained by Missouri police earlier this year without charge, after running out of gas while crossing the state, and died under suspicious circumstances.
The advisory also highlights a new report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office that states that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The advisory is for people to be alert and alert their families, friends and coworkers to the possibility of being in Missouri", Chapel said.
"People should be ready to bring bail money, to inform their relatives that they will pass through this state".
Missouri had 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranks the state 16th in the nation for the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for a business to sue for discrimination when renting a home or hiring.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) previously issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration enforcement laws mandating that local law enforcement authorities arrest people for immigration violations; the ACLU says this will increase enforcement based on race.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to this practice in response to a number of laws and trends within the United States.
Demba Ba is in Beşiktaş, all right.
Demba Ba, who was transferred to Chinese team Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million euros two seasons ago and was loaned to the Black and Whites in the middle of last season, returns to Beşiktaş for free.
The Black Eagle, who asked the Senegalese player for a detailed medical report last week, took action after the report from the star footballer.
The Black and White management, who have begun work on the 32-year-old, whom the Chinese representative did not consider for the squad next season, knocked on the door of the Shanghai team.
Not in the list
Demba Ba, who was not listed because of his foreign status in China, has told the administration that he wants to return to the Black and White.
The Chinese team has approved the departure of the 32-year-old.
The Senegalese footballer is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days and sign an official contract.
Castillo was operated on at Trabzonspor.
In a statement on the website of the Bordeaux-Blue club, Castillo underwent arthroscopic meniscus surgery on his left knee at the Liv Hospital in Istanbul, stating, "It is expected that our player will start training with the team in 4 weeks after the operation performed by Prof. Dr. Uğur Haklar".
Castillo was injured in the right back injury during the preliminary match of the Bordeaux-blue team against the Dutch team Heerenveen in the Slovak camp.
The Colombian player, who was told he would be out of the field for three to four weeks due to treatment, was also scheduled to undergo surgery for a meniscus problem he had previously suffered.
The referendum exit from Barzan!
Barzani made a speech at a memorial ceremony in the city of Duhok on the 3rd anniversary of the terrorist organization Daesh's attack on the Yezidi in the Sinjar district of Mosul.
Referring to the independence referendum that the ICFI wanted to hold on September 25, Barzani said: "I have to say with sadness that we have no hope that Iraq will be a fair and orderly country".
We tried all sorts of ways with Iraq, but we were completely helpless and desperate.
Our past experiences with Iraq have led us to this point, and there's no guarantee that we'll be able to take our rights and be protected.
So, to ensure life and security together, we must show the world that we can all decide our fate through referendum.
I should also emphasize that the referendum is not an end for us, but a means to a greater end.
Barzani recalled that the Iraqi central government made many promises to the Kurds after the 2003 fall of the Baath regime, and said that the decision to hold a direct referendum was taken after the fight with Daesh, noting that the disaster in Sinjar had occurred shortly afterwards.
Barzani expressed his desire to determine his destiny in a peaceful and democratic way for the people of the ICFI to protect themselves and develop, saying, "It has been shown by the documents that Iraq cannot protect us as a state or does not want to protect us".
"He doesn't want us to move forward".
Barzani noted that during the fight against the terrorist organization Daesh, the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons, but in a short time, Hashdi Shabi, which was established by a fatwa, was immediately legalized and all weapons were provided:
The Peshmerga has not been contacted within Iraq's defense system.
The central government did not do to Peshmerga what it offered to Hashdi Shabi.
Peshmerga is constitutionally recognized as part of Iraq's defense system.
But when Hashdi Shabi was not in the constitution, the laws were violated and all the possibilities were mobilized.
We're not saying we're against Hashdi Shabi.
Peshmerga and Hashdi Shabi fought on the same front, so why is it that while Hashdi Shabi is being legalized, the existence of Peshmerga and its fight against terrorism is being covered up?
These are the deep wounds we have with Baghdad.
The terrorist group Daesh attacked the Yezidi population in the Sinjar district of Mosul on 3 August 2014, killing many people, including women and children.
10 minutes to turn around from the disaster
According to a report by the BBC, a Boeing 777 passenger plane belonging to Air France was flying west of Hokkaido in northern Japan while a North Korean missile was in the air.
Officials said the missile was estimated to have approached the plane at 100-150 kilometers, which is 10 minutes after it hit the area.
Air France said the missile did not intersect with the plane's flight path and that there were no problems with the flight.
"The information we have at this stage indicates that the missile fell into the sea more than 100 kilometers from the plane's course", the statement said.
Is nothing sacred?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most definite sign of regime change is that they're starting to attack the statues.
The Americans know the fate of this as well as anyone, such as the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003 in Firdos Square in Baghdad...
Stephen Miller, one of the key theorists of the Trump regime, knew exactly what he was doing when he symbolically destroyed the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to severely restrict legal immigration.
In fairness, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
If he did, a boatload of tour owners and Freedom impersonators would lynch him.
But he attacked its meaning, and especially the meaning attributed to it, after the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to the base of the monument in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.
Miller, in his opening remarks to Acosta, said, "I don't want to be here to tell history from beginning to end, but the Statue of Liberty is a luminous symbol of American freedom to the world.
The poem you mention was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty".
Miller's actually right, but as he said, it's not really about the date.
This seems to be a contemporary echo of Lazarus's terrifying words, in which a state invites not only some old immigrants but also the poor of the poor: "The tired, the poor, the crowded, the crowded masses long to breathe freedom, the unwanted, the miserable of the crowded, the unwanted of the crowded land".
There's never been a time when the "unwanted" has been so visible on our screens.
Miller wasn't making a literary critique; he was explaining that these people don't like Trump in the United States.
The conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a larger political and cultural war: it's actually a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus and his friends, who campaigned to have his words placed at the base of the statue after his death, knew full well that they were engaged in a very political act.
The statue was intended to celebrate the links between French and American republicanism by representing, metaphorically, the coming of Liberty in the female form.
Lazarus changed that meaning: the female figure in his poem was no longer abstract, it had a voice.
And she gives herself a very peculiar name: Mother of the Deported.
The marriage of poetry and image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American anti-immigration.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightists have long wanted to change it back.
Rush Limbaugh, a big mouthed Baptist John for Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that Liberty was not inviting anyone in but rather an early-era neoconservative who kept the American flame in a world that was left in darkness: "Miss Liberty is coming out.
He's there to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Not to light the way to the United States".
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was all about the angle of perception.
Lazarus's amazing creative act was to see it as seen by exhausted, despondent but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often disastrous journeys.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who were looking for a place to hide and want to improve their lives.
Her statue responded to them with words of hope and the warm welcome they needed to hear.
Of course, that's not a perspective that Miller and Trump would find justified in any way.
Their torch is not to guide but to drive away their only source of power, hatred.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scotsmen could make the Great Britain team
UK Athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-man Scottish squad for the World Championships will make a "huge contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that UK athletics should learn from it.
Black said, "We're embracing it and we're trying to figure it out and we're going to work until we get it out of the way".
"I'm talking to the people at the Scottish Institute of Sport, and they think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish Athletics thinks it's about what they do.
British athletics: He thinks it's about what they do.
So is the guy on the street in the corner.
Whatever the combination of conditions, it's absolutely wonderful".
Several Scottish athletes are vying for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the squad as captain.
"Eilidh is a little low-minded.
The captain's speech was incredible".
"Whether they're Scottish or wherever they live or wherever they train, a few athletes came out of that room very proud and really motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally added was amazing".
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" that 16 Scots are on the British team.
Scotland's best overall athlete figures in previous world championships were seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The leader is middle-distance runner Muir, who broke five British and two European records last year.
He's going to compete in the 1500m and 5000m.
Chris O'Hare, who has had a very good season, including the British Team trials and victories at the New Year's Games, is another Scot to watch.
Doyle remembers the first championship when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says he is "very proud" of the move, as many of his sisters will not only be on the team but will in some cases compete for medals and fight for the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that it was voted on by the other members of the team, so it was a huge honor, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me".
"I'm proud of all the Scots who made the team.
That's how far we've come.
And they're here as proven athletes, athletes who are looking to get on the podium.
As for the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we're very lucky in this situation, in that we have a World Championship in our house.
So, it's really just the effect of being able to take advantage of this in-field support and the fact that we're back in the Olympic Stadium that we're successful.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and fight, and it's going to be such a great atmosphere".
Blocking critics on Facebook: If you can't remove voters' criticism, don't run for public office
The father of our country had some knowledge of negative press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long before the newspapers began to harshly criticize him about everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Of course, he was upset by the criticism.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be abolished and we can be led to slaughter in a stupid and silent way".
Which brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff ignored the case on the grounds that it was minor, and online comments were filled with "who cares?" reactions.
A lot of people said, "It's just Facebook".
But it's important.
Especially when it's someone like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor who is surprisingly popular in a state where the oppressor is a predominantly Democrat.
He has the second highest approval rating of any of the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not a reactionary firecracker.
He was a master at leading his province and a staunch believer in principles.
He was also quite adept at using Facebook as his primary tool to connect with his constituents, with his humorous presentation of his hairless post-chemotherapy head.
So blocking people from visiting the governor's page, which is a public forum, officially certified and run by staff members who pay the people's tax dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than editing them.
But it's easy to use images of trolls or spammers or hateful people doing online verbal attacks.
The Post spoke to some of the actual people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner, and a priest; not trolls.
They all said that his comments were not respectful, considerate, and blasphemous.
The pastor shared a quote from the Bible, referring to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Maryland, was not hateful but asked about hate crimes.
He wrote in the Post's comment section of the story, "I have made a subtle comment that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news".
"I also don't like the idea that when so many people are commenting on the same issue, it's just a big group of concerned citizens, rather than some, who are ignoring it as a collective effort".
What the governor's staff called a "focused spam attack" will probably be called "advocacy" by others.
The Facebook era makes it easy to make a message easily relevant by blocking an opponent or deleting a negative message.
Much cleaner than the old days when staff were sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest and silence protesters.
But, even if it's digital, that's exactly what's happening.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for disabling Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from their Twitter feed.
One of the decisions that could be a reference in the future on this issue came from Virginia last week.
The Loudoun County Board of Supervisors chairman violated the First Amendment when he banned a poll on Facebook, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R-C) was visited by the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable mail had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, newspapers quadrupled in number, and anonymous letter writers eroded his leadership.
Even then, Washington had its unnamed trolls.
People using the aliases "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius", and "Portius" all wrote letters to the newspapers denouncing Washington's decisions.
According to the online historical document collection Project, the George Washington Papers, the office was overwhelmed by petitions criticizing his handling of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation with Britain.
But he didn't shut them up.
Freedom of speech, freedom of dissent and freedom of association are at the heart of our nation.
And true leadership is about accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to be at the Renaissance Club in the comfort of his own home.
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty hopes to be at the comfort of his home over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in South Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who finished with the lead of the next goal before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, feels a commitment to the new venue and acts as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club build and we see it reaching its glory with this organization", Rafferty said.
The players will see the field in its best, in a state of the art.
Jerry did a great job building this place.
He's a tireless advocate of the game and proud of his accomplishments here.
It's a great show for this field".
The British Eales will fight for a championship for the first time in his 32-year career, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
The Southport-based player said, "It feels really special".
"I never had a chance to defend the Extremadura Open because it was cancelled the year after I won.
It's good to be back in this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Memories are coming back from last year, and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a truly special time and one that we will always remember with love".
Gary Orr, who turned 50 earlier this year and is now on the European Senior Tour, is returning to the game on his own turf.
This will be the first Scottish tournament since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always makes a little more sense when you're struggling inside", said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well, but you feel extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played golf hard.
I'm happy to be gone so far".
On the field, the trio is comprised of former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, with the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

I found the answer.
Imagine a "seat" with a budget of 6 billion 867 million Turkish Liras, more than the budget allocated to each of the 11 ministries, including the Ministries of Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science, Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism!
The number of personnel is 117 378.
The biggest propaganda base in Turkey!
Yes, I mean the Department of Religious Affairs!
Yes, I will mention the head of the Diyanet Affairs, Mehmet Görmez!
I've been searching for the answer to the question in my head for days.
I wonder why Mehmet Görmez was removed from his seat...
I read every article about his deportation.
No, I'm not going.
I can't find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
Earlier this year...
Mehmet Görmez prepared the Strategic Plan of the Presidency of Diyanet Affairs (DIB) for 2017-2021.
A Mercedes S600 worth 1 million liras was withdrawn by President Erdogan.
So he had no problem with Erdogan.
So what happened?
You might say, "Is seven years of service not enough?"
The first DIB President M. Ryfat Börekci served for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Yılmaz, who you all know, sat on that bench for 11 years.
So... the president's term is up.
I return to the question: why did Mehmet Görmez leave his seat?
It's all settled.
Shiite affinity
A source close to the government said: "According to tradition, the people of Mehmet Dönmez did not abide by the circumcision".
The code of this sentence is: "He did not have circumcision".
The person who uttered that sentence stuck this behind him: "The modernist was found by the traditional ulema!"
I mean, Mehmet Görmez was seen as innovative.
What did you mean, "innovation"?
The answer to the question was hidden in a foreign trip of Mehmet Görmez.
The date is December 27, 2015.
Mehmet Görmez went to Iran to attend the 29th Unity Conference in Tehran, which aims to bring the Islamic sects closer together.
He met with Ayatollah Ali Hamaney, the religious leader of Iran.
He prayed in a row with the Shi'a clergy.
And he said in the lecture: "Cultures are human schools that have evolved over time, representing different ideas and beliefs in the understanding of Islam".
All of them seek guidance from Allah.
And all are at a fixed distance, and they are all equal in destination.
It is never acceptable to identify the sect with religion or to see sectarianism above Islam.
Discrimination, alienation and conflict based on prejudice is a reflection of ignorance and ignorance.
When cults have overtaken religion, it has been religion itself that has suffered the most.
I want to emphasize again by underlining here:
The Shi'a and the Sunnis are one community.
"No one can deny another because he perceives Islam as he understands it or does not live it".
A year later...
The 30th Unitary Meeting was attended by only the Caferi leader Selahattin Özgündüz from Turkey.
I mean, I...
It 's not Sunni , it 's Wahhabism .
Mehmet Görmez's visit to Iran and his speech at the conference made him a target of the "traditional ulema".
This is why no one representing the Turkish state attended the next Tehran conference - again.
Mehmet Görmez had been unable to attend four times since he was appointed.
The reason was obvious: the anti-Shia-Iranian "traditional ulema" at the DIB!
Immediately after his visit to Iran, from the beginning of 2016, Mehmet Görmez's seat began to be worn out.
The Vice Prime Minister, who was responsible for the DIB at the time, was Numan Kurtulmuş!
Mehmet Görmez was so overwhelmed, he wanted to be linked to the DIB presidency.
The point is...
There was a difference of opinion about circumcision within the state.
Theoretical worlds were being created by some "traditional ulema" in Saudi Arabia and Egypt's madrasas, who were equating Sunnism with Wahhabi-Selefi in the shadow of the United States!
These were anti-Iranians who couldn't stand a trip to Tehran.
It was not surprising that Ahmed Jubbeli said about Mehmet Görmez: "Diyanet was not in danger from this".
"Lord, grant me a good leader, loyal to your people and faithful to your family".
They used "ehlisünnet" as a symbolic concept of Iranian hostility.
The anti-Iran campaign once carried out by FETO, backed by the CIA, was now being run by new names.
And with the fetal combs...
A photo of a young man with whiskey in his hand was served to the media with the lie "Son of Mehmet Görmez"!
Oh, what a coincidence!
Who has made the biggest opposition to Mehmet Görmez in the media: the US-led Işıkçılar Cemaati newspaper Turkey!
After all...
- Who resisted bringing Sunnis into the Saudi Wahhabi-Salafi line...
- Who doesn't feed the sectarian...
A modernist... a clergyman whose consciousness was destroyed by the "traditional ulema" created during the Cold War...
US cultural imperialism is rapidly continuing to Arabize Turkey.
Do not doubt that the next head of Diyanet Affairs will be a Wahhabi-Selefi representative!
"We support the preservation of Turkish sovereignty"
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu went to China for an official visit.
At the State Residence in Beijing, Cavusoglu and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a joint press conference.
"We hope Turkey will participate more actively in international affairs".
China will support Turkey in its efforts to maintain its sovereignty, stability and security.
"We hope that the Palestinian issue will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey", he said.
Regarding the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Çavuşoğlu said that "Turkey is seeking close cooperation with regional and international organizations, and international organizations are not alternatives to each other, but complementary".
The spiritual officially begins its second period
The presidency of Hassan Rouhani, who won the presidential election in Iran in May, was confirmed by the country's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Hassan Rouhani, who was elected president for the second time in Iran, took the oath of office at a ceremony attended by the country's religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
The ceremony, attended by high-level military and political figures as well as representatives of foreign countries, was attended by Turkey's Ambassador to Tehran, Rıza Hakan Tekin.
Rouhani, who will serve as president for four more years, will officially take office on Saturday, August 5, after the swearing-in ceremony in parliament.
The ceremony is expected to be attended by Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekçi, who represents Turkey.
Security measures at the Cilvegü Border Gate
People carrying humanitarian aid, food, medicine, cleaning supplies will not be allowed to pass through the Cilvegözü Border Gate in Reyhanlı district of Hatay.
According to the information received, due to the negative security conditions in the area of the Babel Air Border Gate and the Cilvegözü Border Gate, located near the Turkish border, the transport of humanitarian aid, food, medicine and cleaning materials was closed.
The aid crews are allowed to exit the Curious Border Gate.
The duration of the restriction was not disclosed.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use the stove when she cooks.
He rarely even uses a bowl.
The housewife puts a sweet potato, often locally known as "note", directly on the fire in her wooden house in Enarotali, in the Paniai Province, a restless region of Papua, Indonesia.
Half an hour later, the charred fist is taken and wiped away with a thirst, without washing the hands.
Degei sits on the muddy floor, doing household chores like washing clothes with the muddy water from the nearby swamp, and has no furniture.
A bucket in a roofless house serves as a desert grasshopper.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned to any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the men in the village are unemployed, many are drinking heavily, and there are soldiers.
"No one walks around the village after 5pm".
A rare glimpse into everyday life in the mountainous regions of Papua, a former Dutch colony absorbed by Indonesia in 1969, after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 people were forced to vote by force, before the Allies invaded.
An existing movement that was propagandizing independence against Dutch rule quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta government, which maintained tight control over the region, banning foreign journalists or rights watchdog organizations.
In 2003, the territory was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is deserted; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the regional capital of Jayapura to Nabire and a five-hour belly-wiggling drive in a rented car.
No public transportation.
The 19,000-person township includes wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, wrinkled iron roofs turned to various yellowish-brown tones by rust.
Let alone journalists, very few Indonesians have traveled here and almost no foreigners have traveled here.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, the Mee Pago worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes", she says, referring to her brightly colored, hand-touched yellow, dark shirt and glossy skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on our bodies".
Papua is the poorest region of Indonesia, with 28 percent of the population living below the poverty line and the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also the golden land of Indonesia.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a mountainous region the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted approximately $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
Yet, the wealth that is a source of misery for the Papuans keeps Indonesia's mighty military alive.
A 2005 New York Times study reports that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including payments of up to $150,000 to a single officer.
The Papuan call for greater autonomy threatens this golden egg-laying hen and its rights are ruthlessly denied.
Since 1969, rights advocates say, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian military, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned.
In the mountainous parts of Papua, mass killings in the 1970s have reached genocidal numbers, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
The 2016 "We Will Lose Everything" report from the Archdiocese of Brisbane includes table witness accounts of the previous year's unlawful executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electrocution are particularly popular), and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because there are incidents every week", says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
As Papua's resources brought in settlers from other parts of Indonesia, pressure was heightened.
The region's population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but the demographics are changing as Muslim immigrants from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi arrive for economic purposes.
They sell gado-gado, served with chicken and vegetable mixed with peanut sauce.
The locals are struggling to compete.
"The migrants sell chicken and vegetables at traditional markets at a lower price than the indigenous Papuans", explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the regional capital, Jayapura, for work.
"This has caused the indigenous Papuans, the Papuans' mama-mama (women), to lose market share".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, vowed to address inequality and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, took the game of 27 of Papua's 29 provinces, including Panaia.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"We are heartbroken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, expecting him to fulfill our hope that justice will be restored", You said.
In fact, Paniai experienced his worst condition just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali, and two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes passed through the darkness.
The frightened kids told them to turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers resented their style, and according to local priest Yavedt Tebai, he later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said that soldiers, who were drunk, chased the group and beat them with the tips of their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the group of children.
One of the boys, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he slipped into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire, and the next day, the situation escalated.
About 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua (running in a ring and imitating the song of birds).
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police and military garrison.
As tensions mounted, orders were sent to the soldiers over the internal radio: "If the crowd shows more than three times resistance, shoot them".
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, the mayor of Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the danger approaching and pleaded with the crowd to return home and demand calm.
No one was listening.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist", he told TIME while presenting his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shot but says the bullet came from a military meltdown
"There was a crowd, multiple shots fired", he adds.
According to his cousin, Alfius Youw, who witnessed the attacks, he was shot three times.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", Yohan, who, like many Indonesians, is known only by his first name, told TIME in a somber tone.
"I saw him die... and I kissed him".
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" the police station because it was under attack.
Papua police spokesman Branch Chief Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015: "When people threaten to kill us, we have to defend ourselves".
"This is a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
News of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura three weeks later, expressing his sympathy for the families of the victims and promising to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case resolved immediately so that it doesn't happen again".
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he had set up a non-judicial mechanism for historic human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the breaches were long ago.
Some in the '90s, some in the early 2000s.
The point is, we are determined to solve these violations, but there are processes that we have to go through".
Speaking to TIME on June 5, Wiranto backtracked, saying there were no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It's all going to be decided by the law".
Wiranto, who accused B.M. of "crimes against humanity" related to the deaths of more than 1,000 people during East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been solved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of Paniai have met such claims with bitter suspicion.
"I have been invited four times in the past three years, but no progress has been made", says Yohanes.
I'm tired of it.
He says he's still living in fear, years later.
He says, "I'm scared".
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot".
His brother Yacobus reiterates his view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the matter.
He says he was beaten by the soldier after helping bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the soldier came looking for me", he says.
The attacks haven't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police opened fire on villagers in Deiyai, a neighbourhood of Paniai.
One person was killed and 17 people, including children, were injured during a clash between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help take an unconscious man to hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, drowned in a nearby lake while fishing and died en route to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's construction office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded with warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in a panic, afraid of retaliation", said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the wounded being raised.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days".
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officials involved in this to be held accountable and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troubled area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development has fueled the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribal peoples scattered throughout Papua's verdant highlands.
Many joined the rebel army Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claimed to protect the rights of Papuans by carrying out random attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya, are coming from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years under the guise of "protecting national sovereignty".
Some are never seen again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
The little rice that is on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for the natives to buy.
Bread is out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly nutmeg, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women who can sustain four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, selling the rest at the local market.
10 notes are only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the indigenous Papuans and the new immigrants arriving in greater numbers at Nabire Airport have grown since the opening of new air routes.
The jobs that are already scarce often go to the more educated and wealthier immigrants.
The Papuan people rarely have the capital or the skills to run their own business competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no work or money", says John Gobai, chairman of the Panai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, there are strict restrictions on international media coverage.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for "lack of coordination with relevant agencies", despite the rare video-making permits they were given.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Jokowi's campaign promises to lift restrictions on news coverage and improve transparency have not been fulfilled.
In a statement, he said: "There are new dangers for foreign journalists covering Papua and West Papua, Indonesia's troubled eastern provinces: visa denial and blacklisting".
The lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbors.
On March 6, the Pacific nation (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "varied and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's claims, telling reporters in Jakarta that "the democratic system is still in place in Indonesia and there is a free media so it is difficult to cover up evidence in human rights cases".
The locals want more foreign government involvement.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the country's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, the local people broke their silence with pleas for "freedom", according to a source who attended the meeting and did not want to be named.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say it is unlikely that they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a well-meaning man, but he is surrounded by people who were involved in the Paniai attack", says tribal council president Gobai.
Jokowi wants the people of Paniai to know that they are living in a miserable state with scarce education and health care, in addition to the imminent threat of a tyrannical army.
Gobai says that the Paniai, like other Papuans, see their vote as a "debt" to Jokowi to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice", he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack carried out a final symbolic act of resistance: burying the body of a victim in the field directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never be served, they will at least ensure that those responsible do not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed", says Yacobus, his head tilted forward.
"What else can we do?"
Fire hits Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire in Dubai on Friday engulfed the world's tallest residential towers, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 79-story structure, which is 337 meters tall.
This is the second major fire to spread rapidly in the tower, which is called the Torch Tower, in two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no explanation was given as to the cause of the massive fire.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get to the 50th floor", a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighters extinguished the massive fire around 4am local time (00:00 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government has announced that they are trying to provide shelter for the victims.
This could raise questions about the safety of materials used in the exterior of tall buildings around the world.
An investigation by the Torch Authority following the 2015 fire found most of the damage to the coating, which is the outer panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe the insulation and coating panel system on Grenfell Tower in London, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June.
The good news of 'social assistance' to more than 4 thousand chronic patients
The social assistance program, which will be launched for poor citizens and their families who are struggling with chronic diseases, according to the Ministry of Family and Social Policies, will benefit 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients in the first phase.
The Ministry, which plans to provide patients with a monthly allowance of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information received, details and principles of implementation of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Struggling with Chronic Diseases" were revealed.
The social assistance program, which was launched in cooperation with the Ministry of Health to support citizens who are struggling with chronic diseases and are experiencing economic and psychological difficulties, is in many ways a first in the world.
The Ministry, which has completed all the necessary preparations for the launch of the program, will provide the families with a social assistance program, not only cash but also regular psychosocial support.
The aim is to ensure that the poor citizens and their families who have chronic diseases and continue their treatment process at home are not left alone, both financially and spiritually.
According to the studies, in the first phase, the new social assistance program will provide regular psychosocial and cash support to poor citizens who are battling tuberculosis and Sub-Acute Sclerosing Panencephaly (SSPE), a brain disease caused by the measles virus.
In the later stages of the program, poor citizens who are struggling with other rare and high-risk diseases will be included in the assistance program.
In addition to the support planned to be provided at a rate of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, additional payments will be made to tuberculosis patients who are unable to afford medical care, are bed-dependent or are identified by the health department as in need of improvement of their home living conditions.
To qualify for the allowance, the minimum monthly income per head of household must be less than two thirds of the net monthly amount.
In addition, the report of the health board of citizens with SSPE must be prepared in accordance with the procedure and principles specified in the "Regulation on the Measurement of Disability, Classification and Health Board Reports to be Given to Disabled Persons".
According to the survey, more than 1 in 5 American passengers bring illegal substances on board.
According to a survey of airline passengers, more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items into the plane from U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who unknowingly carried prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Less than 1 percent later claimed to have noticed they were accidentally travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study of more than 1,000 people conducted by jet charter service Stratos Jet Charters also found that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the participants who admitted to knowingly trying to fly something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were Y-band members, while less than 15 percent were X-band members.
The most common substances that are deliberately taken from TSA agents are food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly passing security with sharp tools, while 2.2 percent of female participants and 3.7 percent of male participants also admitted knowingly carrying illicit drugs on the plane.
The company said it was surveying passengers nationwide to find out how many people from airport security were accidentally bringing in contraband and how many were doing it on purpose.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to smuggle contraband through security, whether they know it or not, are the flyers.
Still, as the firm notes, TSA rules are a bit tricky and confusing.
People are often unsure of what liquids or how much of them they can carry.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount ever seized by the TSA turned out to be prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought that TSA might be treating the books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international ones.
China welcomed the US statement
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking at a press conference in Beijing, said that the Tillerson administration was "not looking for an excuse to change the regime, to collapse the regime, to rapidly reunify the peninsula, and to send our troops north of the 38th parallel".
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang reiterated the principles of the Tillerson administration in Washington regarding North Korea, and expressed hope that the United States would implement these principles effectively and in a policy oriented to concrete results.
Wang stressed that the security of the Korean Peninsula is a priority, and that they expect the parties to find a middle ground through which to resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that the Beijing administration has always insisted on the denuclearization of the peninsula, the preservation of peace and stability, and the resolution of problems through dialogue and negotiation.
EPA President Pruitt has given up on delaying Obama-era emissions cuts.
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency President Scott Pruitt reversed his decision to delay the implementation of previous Obama-era laws that reduced emissions of air pollutants that cause smog.
Pruitt represented a change in his organization's response to the needs of state environmental regulators, which was more responsive than previous administrations.
He never mentioned the legal challenge to his previous position in a federal high court.
It's about the states starting to meet the 2015 deadline for ground-level ozone standards, October 1.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year to give his organization more time to work on the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump, had long served as a reliable ally against tighter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
Wednesday's sudden change is the latest legal defeat for Pruitt's reversal agenda.
Last month, a federal high court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator's attempt to delay the implementation of an Obama administration law requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks was an overreach of his authority.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that the rollback in ozone standards only reinforces the EPA's commitment to working with states to meet new standards in a timely manner and through complex processes.
Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job, said: "Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines for decisions, waited for activist groups and others to sue, and agreed on dispute resolution to set timelines for decisions".
"We don't believe in settlement by litigation, and we take term dates seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously".
However, the EPA's statement noted that Pruitt could once again use its "delay authority and all other authority legally available" at some point to ensure that the regulations are "backed by sound policies and the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone laws.
A House bill passed last month seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 laws by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue the legal push.
Schneiderman said, "The EPA's decision to change its decision following our lawsuits is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities".
The lawsuit was filed in New York from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is produced when general pollutants are emitted from automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources that react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The foul smoke emitted can cause serious respiratory problems in a group of people who are easily affected and contributes to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise decision change.
"It's disturbing that so much pressure is needed from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe to get this sensible step", said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological struggle to exploit polluters and interest groups".
Inflation is in single digits
Turkey, which recorded the biggest increase in exports in six years in July, with unemployment at 13 percent in January, and the economic confidence index at 10.5 in April, also dropped inflation to one digit.
According to the data released by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜIK), the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.15 percent in July, while the annual inflation fell to a single digit for the first time since January, at 9.79 percent.
In July, the highest monthly increase in the main spending groups was in the restaurant and hotel group at 1.75 percent, while the largest decline was in clothing and footwear at 3.51 percent.
The highest year-on-year increase was in the transportation group with 15.24 percent.
The Economist of Business Investment Muammer Kömürcüoğlu, who noted that inflation fell to one household in July, in parallel with expectations, said, "The moderate course of inflation has the effect of the decline in the prices of food and clothing groups".
But the core indicators, contrary to the headline, are up from the previous month.
"We don't expect a relaxation in the central bank's strict stance", he said.
Despite the decline in headline inflation, there was an increase in core inflation indicators.
The B index of the special comprehensive TUEFE indicators, which the Central Bank is closely monitoring, rose from 9.07 percent to 9.46 percent in July, while the C index rose from 9.20 percent to 9.60 percent.
According to the report, the inflation rate could be closed from 9.3 percent, while the Vice Director of Capital FX Research Enver Erkan said, "Inflation could fluctuate until December and fall to one digit in December".
"The Central Bank may have an opportunity in the first months of 2018", he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek: Inflation will close the year with a single digit.
The central bank's tightening will continue until inflation drops below 7 percent.
We'll finalize the reforms at the next Food Committee.
Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci: We are happy that inflation has fallen to single digits, but it has to become permanent.
In order to combat inflation, we need to reduce the volatility of food prices and increase the supply.
Minister of Development Lütfi Elvan: Due to the base effect, the annual inflation may be slightly upward in the coming months, but the decline in inflation will be evident from the first months of 2018.
We're predicting annual inflation to fall even lower.
I wish Fenerbahçe success in their next matches.
Sturm Graz technical director Franco Foda said that their second-half performance in the UEFA Europa League third qualifying round match, in which they drew 1-1 with Fenerbahçe, was not enough to skip the round.
Speaking at a press conference after the match, Foda stated that Fenerbahçe was a top-level team, "We couldn't use the wings in the first half".
We had a good second half.
We had a chance for the second goal.
I'm proud of the team, though.
They changed the game in the second half.
We could have been a little better.
Little things in the game were decisive.
"I wish Fenerbahçe success in their next matches".
Foda said that they felt very good during their stay in Turkey and were happy with the hospitality they had seen.
Fernando is in Istanbul
Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, who is in the transfer negotiations for Galatasaray, has arrived in Istanbul.
The Brazilian footballer arrived at Atatürk Airport and was greeted with enthusiasm by the fans.
Fernando, with his yellow-and-red fans cheering and showing affection, left the airport in a private vehicle waiting for him under security.
Fernando, 30, who started his career with Brazil's Vila Nova, has been deployed in the midfield, playing for Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City.
The Brazilian is expected to sign with the yellow-and-red team after undergoing a medical check-up.
Galatasaray, which is continuing the transfer work, has secured a deal with Manchester City for 5 million 250 thousand euros for Fernando, who has been trying to join his squad for a long time.
The US has launched a flash attack on Raqqa.
Colonel Dillon, who was in charge of video conferencing from Baghdad, said the coalition-trained Raqqa Internal Security Force (IRIGF) had begun to settle in areas cleared of ISIS in the city.
"In the clearing areas of the city, the Raqqa Internal Security Force, composed mostly of Arabs and local anti-ISIS volunteers, continues to maintain order and prevent terrorists from escaping or returning", Dillon said.
Dillon said that 230 more people had joined the group this week, completing their training, adding that "the number of the force in question is 850 at present".
Dillon said the coalition has trained the group in basic weapons training, as well as first aid, armed conflict, scanning and checkpoint operations.
Dillon said the coalition will continue to screen applicants for training and employment.
The US-led coalition is collaborating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the main backbone of the PYD/PKK, in taking Raqqa.
The PYD/PKK terrorist organization appointed a PKK terrorist named Leyla Mohammed as co-chair of the Raqqa civilian administration council.
It is alleged that PKK/PYD members will be among the military forces in Raqqa.
Dillon also announced that the US-led coalition had withdrawn heavy weapons from the rebel group Shuhada Karyateyn in the southern Syrian camp of El Tanif, which it had cut off support last week.
"After meeting with their leaders last week, the Shouk returned the heavy weapons and equipment the coalition had given them, but some small arms and light vehicles were allowed to remain", Dillon said.
The US announced last week that it was withdrawing support from Shughuk on the grounds that it had gone on patrols outside the conflict zones agreed with Russia and was engaged in activities unrelated to the fight against Daesh.
The group is said to be fighting against the regime of Bashar al-Assad as well as Daesh.
According to the leaked phone records, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
Notes of phone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
In a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on January 27, Trump slammed him for not publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States rebuked the president of Mexico who held the ball against the wall in public and reportedly said, "You can't tell the press".
Trump launched his presidential campaign on building a wall along the southern border of the United States and promised to pay Mexico for the project.
Notes from his first meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which unleashed a heated dialogue, were also released.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the agreement on the U.S. taking refugees to Australia was "ridiculous", "rotten" and "stupid", and that the Obama administration's deal would make him look "foolish" after he proposed a refugee resettlement ban on the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended his speech by saying to Mr. Turnbull, "That was the most unpleasant speech I've had all day".
The patient's relatives broke the doctor's nose
Doctors and employees of the Turkey Higher Education and Research Hospital stopped short-term work yesterday morning in response to a doctor's colleagues being beaten by relatives of the patient.
The crowd gathered in front of the main entrance of the hospital with signs saying "No to violence in healthcare" in their hands, reacting to the incident.
The head of the clinic of pediatric cardiology, Prof. Dr. Feyza Aysenur Paç, said, "The slogan 'No to violence in healthcare' seems to me to be insufficient or even a side slogan".
There's no place for violence in health.
"If this goes on, this population will soon find no health group to serve them", he said.
The action of health workers was supported by the Provincial Health Director of Ankara Dr. Kamil Turkmen, the General Secretary of the Public Hospitals of Ankara First Region Prof. Dr. Öner Odabaş, the Chief Physician of the Turkish Higher Education and Research Hospital Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç and the patients' relatives in the hospital garden.
Condemning the incident, Paç said:
Unfortunately, violence against health workers is on the rise.
We're reliving an example of this incident last night, when our cardiovascular surgeon was struck by a patient's loved one.
Although we have taken all possible measures as our government, ministry and governorate to end these events as soon as possible, we also demand increased awareness of our people in this matter.
I condemn yesterday's events on behalf of my hospital and my medical staff.
Odabaş, who stressed the need to raise awareness about violence in health, said, "Unfortunately, this has become a professional complication that we experience from time to time".
"We will take our own measures but the most important thing is that our nation has its own health worker".
Turkmen said that the judicial process has begun, adding that "our laws on violence in health care have been sufficiently effective".
It's practiced by the highest levels of government.
Police are working on it right now.
In the past, these were always vacant, but now it's a direct civil case, and the state's attorney is assigned to follow the case.
"There are examples of severe punishment in this regard", he said.
After the explanations, the employees continued their work.
The alleged incident occurred at approximately 5:45 p.m. the day before.
The relatives of the patient who lost his life in the intensive care unit attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Uzbek, who was working in the department of cardiovascular surgery, who had reported the death.
Uzbek was evacuated from the scene by doctors and assistants, and police were called to the hospital.
The attackers were arrested while Uzbek's nose was broken in the incident.
One of the doctors who witnessed the incident said:
When our friend went to the relatives of a patient who had lost his life to report the condition, the relatives of the patient attacked our two friends, blaming the situation on our friend and us.
Our friend's nose was broken, he was covered in blood.
Then we took our friend into the O.R. and hid him.
He had a security set between us for 15 to 20 minutes.
If the patient's loved ones had crossed that security fence, things would have been much worse.
A major blow to ISIS in Gaziantep: 102 sacks of weapons...
According to the information, in the investigation conducted by the Gaziantep Republic Prosecutor's Office, 5 thousand 100 kilograms of ammonium nitrate were seized in 102 bags of explosives used in the construction of a warehouse in Kayaönü Mahallesi, which was determined to be the property of the terrorist organization DEAŞ.
In the operation, where 6 people were detained, 10 long-barreled weapons, 35 firearms, 2 thousand 370 filled firecrackers, 3 pistols, 7 firearms and 382 filled firecrackers, 2 hunting rifles and 1 shovel, 39 thousand 705 TL and 15 thousand 870) USD, in total 163 thousand TL worth of bills of exchange issued on behalf of different persons, cheques in the amount of 40 thousand 500 TL, 2 blank checkbooks and a large number of digital materials were seized.
The search also found four books issued by the publishing bodies of the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization and containing a decision to collect them.
The six detainees were sent to the judicial authorities after their interrogation.
The suspects were arrested by the Peace Penal Tribunal, the guard they were sent to.
The YPG raid in Syria...
The US intervened
According to local sources, the AA has learned that YPG terrorists, with the military support of the United States, have looted the homes of residents of Tel Semin, a northern village of Raqqa, which the terrorist organization entered on the pretext of fighting Daesh.
The reaction of civilians who were looted and their homes confiscated turned into a clash with the terrorist organization.
U.S. forces in the area then entered the city with armored vehicles.
Cougar MRAP armored vehicles, personnel carriers and Husky mine detectors were seen to be buffer zones in the area.
The YPG is preventing civilians from entering the cities it controls, which were shot down in Raqqa during the anti-ISIS operation.
The local activist network "Rakka is being silently massacred" announced yesterday that 121 civilians were killed by the organization's artillery fire in July alone.
Let's not postpone the old world's fights to tomorrow.
Delayed perception of domestic and global realities can lead to crises not only of ordinary people but also of countries.
One of the reasons why the backward East is so slow to perceive the realities of the world, which we call "the West", is that these realities are either blocked by certain focuses or are proclaimed in a transcendent way.
Don Quixote and Oblomov Realities and change, perceived late or not at all, have also been a subject of literary discourse.
Cervantes' Don Quixote is a meczup who still thinks he's a knight in the age of the bourgeoisie.
Or Goncharov's "Oblomov" is a lazy legacy that believes that when you ignore the facts, everything can go on as before.
China, for example, was a country open to the world and sea-dominant until the end of the 15th century, when a conservative dynasty came to power and closed it in.
This has lasted until the execution of the captains of boats that left Chinese land waters.
We Turks, who have one foot, eye and ear in the West and the other foot, eye and ear in the East, have had constant dilemmas in perceiving realities and change, starting with the Ottomans.
We tried to bring yesterday into the present, to understand today in terms of old conditions, to think of yesterday as tomorrow.
And some of us were able to move as quickly as the thinking in the developed world in perceiving the realities of home and the world and the change.
This has led to constant conflict and tension.
The encounter of madrasah and university, the newcomer and the modern army, faith and doubt, led to a dualism of dramatic content.
Progressiveness is obsolete. Worse, it was not accepted that the new and advanced positions of a period would become obsolete and backward at the end of certain periods.
Yesterday's progressives, after a period, began to declare the new and advanced "Dangerous", while those who tried to interpret the country and world conditions in accordance with the current reality began to declare "Treason".
The most important lesson in the Ottoman Empire is that those who perceive the realities of the country and the world late dominate the thought and state life, eventually the empire collapsed, collapsed and the people became poor.
The most important lesson our Ottoman past taught the Republic was that the rapid perception of global conjoncture and change was an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
Because we have so well absorbed this lesson, we have been able to be an example of this country of geography, which has managed to maintain its unity, its integrity, its stability in peace from the First World War to the present day.
A different approach, and in order to survive the global change that is coming, we need to put the memories behind us and act in accordance with reality.
In other words, it will do no good to bring back the senseless camping and bloodshed that have crippled our democracy in the past.
And in today's world, the smallest mistakes can lead to the biggest and most dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography is the Middle East, where we are.

"Our operations in the fight against crime and criminals will be continued with determination for the peace and security of our people".
The turkey wind
Global giants, who trust in Turkey's future, fought the crushing blow of yesterday's wind power auction.
A world record was broken in the tender for the model devised by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to reduce foreign dependence and ensure the transition to national energy.
The tender, which will bring down Turkey's energy costs, will open the way for investments of 1 billion dollars and nearly 4 thousand jobs.
By early 2019, domestically produced wind turbines will be integrated into the system.
The renewable resource area (RES) wind power plant license tender opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENER) involved 8 consortia, including US, Chinese, German and Danish giants.
In the tender, financial bid envelopes were opened in order to determine the five bidders who first offered the lowest bid.
After the initial bidding envelopes, the lowest bid was $4.19/kWh.
The open decline range is set at 0.01 cents.
After the bidding process began, the joint venture groups Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas decided not to participate in the open reduction.
The open reduction was contested by groups including Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang.
After the Nordex consortium was also withdrawn, MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon were the last two.
Mingyang-First Construction has been on hiatus 11 times.
The Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon Energy consortium has never had a break.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak: This is a record day for Turkey.
The open reduction lasted 30 laps.
The winner of the intense dispute between the two consortia was the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon joint venture group, which offered the lowest bid at 3.48 cents/kWh.
The consortium offered $3.49 cents per kilowatt hour, but withdrew its bid to $3.48 at the request of the bidding commission chaired by Deputy Mayor Alparslan Bayraktar.
With the result of the two-hour YEKA auction, Turkey has achieved a world record.
The bid of $3.48 per kilowatt hour is the lowest in the world in this area.
The previous record was held by Mexico at $3.84 per kilowatt hour.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak, who held a press conference after the tender was concluded, stated that the German company Siemens' win was an important message to the region and the world, "When we look at the 200-year historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think this result will make an important contribution to the Turkish-German relations".
Our goals are big.
Today's results show how solidly and confidently the economy and energy markets are moving forward.
I am proud to show that no matter how many regional crises there are in the world, Turkey is at the forefront of the region and the most reliable countries in the world to invest in.
"The greatest contribution to this picture, which we will be proud of as 80 million people, is the President's, who has brought Turkey to this point in his 15 years of power and leadership", he said.
Albayrak said that they have started a new era with an open, transparent and competitive tender: "One of the most important steps was the purchase price of 10.3 dollars per kilowatt hour with the domestic contribution to the wind, falling to a historical record of 3.48 dollars per cent, a world record price".
I'm proud of it, on behalf of my people, on behalf of my country.
Minister Albayrak stated that they aim to put the first domestic production panels in solar energy into operation before the end of 2018, and said, "Inshallah by the beginning of 2019, we will include our domestic production wind turbines in the system".
Turbines will be installed in five designated areas.
The winning company will have a total installed capacity of 1,000 megawatts, provided that it installs at least 50 megawatts of wind power in each of these five regions.
The total investment of the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon group will be over one billion dollars.
With the start-up of local wind farms, at least 3 billion kilowatt hours of electricity will be generated each year and the annual electricity needs of about 1.1 million homes will be met by wind.
The wind farms will also reduce emissions by an average of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year.
The winning company will build the factory with an investment of over $100 million.
The plant will produce an average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines with a minimum capacity of 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium will conduct R&D for a total of 10 years in at least three of the five areas: wing, generator design, material technologies and manufacturing techniques, software and innovative gearbox.
The R&D budget is $5 million per year, and 50 technicians, 80 percent of them local engineers, will be working on the project.
The factory will be set up 21 months after the contract is signed.
The project's license is for 30 years.
Kazım Türker, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Turkers İnşaat, who participated in the winning consortium, said that the project will be about 64 percent of domestic production, 35 percent of the equipment will come from abroad, "We plan to provide the financing of equipment from foreign sources, and the rest from local banks".
Turker stated that the bid reflects confidence in the Turkish economy.
"Turkey's dependence on foreign countries will be reduced by another 1,000 megawatts".
"We're happy with the end", he said.
SIemens Gamesa Turkey CEO Hakan Yıldırım also stated that they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years, and said, "We will do our best to further reduce the cost of electricity".
The wind turbines to be produced at the plant will have a minimum localisation rate of 65 percent.
65 percent of the 8,000 industrial parts in the wind turbine will be indigenous (at least 5,200 pieces).
At least 50 MW and a total of 1000 MW will be installed in each of the 5 zones.
Employment opportunities for 3,750 people 10 years R&amp;D commitment 5 million dollars to R&amp;D activities each year
1,000MW Wind Plant 65% Location Rate Production of 300 to 450 local wind turbines with a minimum capacity of 2.3 MWe.
The investment of over 1 billion dollars per year 400 MW/year wind turbine production capacity over 100 million dollars factory investment.
Electricity generation to meet the needs of about 1.1 million homes Minimum 3 billion kWh of electricity production per year Average 1.5 million tons of CO2 emissions per year.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Revive the Racist Lynch for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury, Monroe, passed through a group of spectators in rural Georgia and made its way crawling towards the little Ford Bridge in Moore.
The car, with four black passengers and a white driver, was blocked by a group of armed white men before they reached the bridge.
The gang leader, a middle-aged man in a thin striped suit, took a long breath from his cigar and looked carefully through the windshield.
Inside, the people were trembling with fear.
"We want this shit, Roger!" he barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams were heard through the darkness as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene of June 22nd is only a reenactment.
But when a ruler was thrown around "Roger's" neck, almost everyone in the audience breathed a very realistic sigh.
Since 2005, human rights activists have been returning to the Ford Bridge in Moore to reenact the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one has been charged with the murders.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the revival, said: "It's amazing that not a single person has been arrested over the years, even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are".
"It is a stain on history but a burden on our souls".
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong human rights activist.
For him, this revival is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to Monroe's community that an injustice has never been rectified.
He said, "We want prosecution, we want results, we want wounds to be closed, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first".
"We cannot have the wounded embraced and reconciled until justice is served".
The coroner is putting a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Ford lynching in Moore on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding areas were suspected of lynching.
But one of them was never investigated.
While the suspects remained fugitives for decades, human rights activists say the twin motives of lynchings have always been well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a high court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in a primary election later that summer.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, his black partner Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight apparently involving a woman.
Brooks stated that the town rumor was that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, a prominent white landowner named Loy Harrison paid $600 to get Malcolm out of prison.
Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey went to prison with her.
But as they drove away from the prison, they came to Ford Bridge in Moore, and a lynch mob surrounded the car.
An FBI report concludes, "It appears that Harrison arranged and ordered the murders".
"And it's also clear that there was a collusion between state and local law enforcement "which not only participated in the murder, "but destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses".
Brooks was shorter and more direct.
He said, "It was a massacre of the right to vote".
"They were all killed to send a message to the black people in this community: 'This is what will happen to you if you register and vote.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has been leading the annual revival of the Ford Bridge lynchings at Moore.
His performance is thoughtful, remarkable, and based on a deep-seated kind of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to turn their gaze, but Greene says that's the point.
He said, "We don't want to talk about lynching because it's confronting us all with the ugliness that's inside us".
"But I can't have a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or what's happening to me".
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) gathered in a room and listened as Greene willingly entered into the well-rehearsed outline of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is serving as the assistant director of Greene.
He's played President Klansman for years, but he says the role never got easier.
Marbaugh said, "I feel dirty because it's not me".
"But I think it's important to keep that past alive, because we don't want to go back to that time".
Actors Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, were rehearsing their lines throughout the room.
The play begins with Malcolm screaming at Hester, who is so angry that he's sleeping with his wife Dorothy, and pushing her.
"I said get off my property!"
He's reacting to Rascona.
There's a knock.
And then everyone (at least the black actors) is drowning in laughter.
Greene is the one who laughs the most.
Rascona said, "What?"
He was nervous, he was surprised.
Was I too harsh?
Greene said, "No", with a chuckle.
"I just don't think white people were saying shit back then".
One of the black players said "Yes" and threw a stone mixed with a joke.
"'You have to press the R.
So the energy in the room changes, and a kind of intimacy replaces the unease.
Everyone is dedicated to doing the right thing, not just for the sake of the game, but for the sake of the four people who were killed.
The scene is starting again.
This time Rascona says the N word, sharp and emphatic.
No one is laughing.
The resuscitation is going on violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire, and then there's silence.
A woman dressed in black, standing over the bodies of the actors, recites Billie Holiday's sad eulogy "Fruit of Wonder".
One of the words breaks her voice.
A hundred yards back, an average crowd of four dozen wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many of them from further up the road.
Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the Malcom and Dorsey cemeteries, all of them enduring Georgia's overwhelming humidity for nearly eight hours.
Up until this point, the murders had been an anecdote, but now standing in the same place where the lynching happened means the weather is cursed.
As the final notes of the song weaken, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and examine their bodies.
The children are crouching on their hands, clutching fake blood and motionless bodies, and whispering to each other.
As if a little boy reminded himself, he mutters, "They're not really dead".
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the crowd and it's over.
Actors throw the lynch line and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh in the suit, who plays President Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow actors and tears flow from his eyes, the emotional cost of the performance finally coming to him.
One of the women whispers, "It's okay".
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did it for a reason".
Then the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta are having a lively conversation with a black couple about revival.
Denise Duplinski is having a hard time finding words to describe how the performance made her feel.
He said, "Hearing these horrible, horrible words and those terrible things... are coming from people who look like you, and they do it because they look like you".
"What this does to me is it makes me think that the lynchings are still going on", he added, "that they're just called police shootings now".
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks is the center of attention as he dines at his desk and recounts his memories of human rights.
He said he's already planning next year's performance.
He said: "Renaissance is inspiring in a way because it describes what we've been through, but it's also educational".
"Like, if you don't learn from this, it's gonna happen again.
Those who do not investigate their past, those who do not know their past, are doomed to repeat it".

According to the information received, the 48 YS 411 car of Adem Sağlam's administration collided with the 09 B 1510 car of Sinan Kyroglan administration at the Salkım position of the Kavaklıdere-Yatağan highway.
A large number of medical and rescue teams were dispatched to the scene following a report to the 112 Emergency Call Center.
Derya Kyroğlan and Yasmin Sağlam, who were found to be 8 months pregnant with Duraniye Kyroğlan, died at the scene of the accident, while Mertcan Kyroğlan died at the Yatağan State Hospital, where he was removed.
The injured Sinan, Senem, Furkan Kiroglan and Adem, Yılmaz and Abdullah Yigit Sağlam Muğla were removed from the Koçman University Teaching and Research Hospital and Yücelen Hospital.
It was learned that the threat to the lives of the wounded continues.
The Yatağan-Kavaklıdere highway was closed for a while because of the accident.
The Mayor of Kavaklıdere Mehmet Demir and Lieutenant General Engin Ocak also arrived at the scene and received information about the accident.
The AK Party's website for the congress
By the AK Party, 6.
A website called "akkongreler.com" was set up for the regular Congress process.
The website contains a brochure, materials and visuals that the party organization will use in this process.
The website's section on communication strategy lists 14 rules to follow during the congress.
The President and AK Party General Chairman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who posted a message on his website, warned the members of the organization to respect the party's corporate identity during the congress.
In his message, Erdogan said, "We are now entering a new period of transition".
We need to renew and renew ourselves to achieve the 2023 targets with more solid steps.
"We must continue to work hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, as yesterday".
To revive the business, Pearson made another 3,000 layoffs, cut its profit share.
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would make 3,000 more layoffs and cut its intermediate profit share by 72 percent, as it embarks on another restructuring program to overcome the pressures the business faces.
Chief executive John Fallon said the layoffs, which are expected to occur mostly in late 2018 and early 2019, will be in addition to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May a plan to save another 300 million pounds ($394 million) by trying to revive the fast-moving digital learning business with a third cost-cutting program.
The firm, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said there was no change in its outlook for this year after reporting a 1 percent increase in core sales in the first half, to £2.05 billion.
Text 2 has led to death again!
According to the initial report from the Forensic Medical Center, Hakan's death was a suicide.
The detailed examination of the boy showed no signs of any bruising or bruising.
The cause of death was a blocked necklace.
The bandage, which his family identified as a bandage, was also found to be the elastic bandage used in the wounds.
According to the report of Muslim Saryar, the report will be sent to the prosecutor's office in Büyükçekmece, which is conducting the investigation.
Police are investigating the boy's suicide in detail, and they're also examining the computer that was seized after the incident.
It was stated that the police will also refer to Hakan's friends for testimony.
It is also said that information from Hakan's computer, which his relatives call "Cleared", could be accessed by third parties or a gang.
Police are investigating the possibility that Hakan was dragged to suicide by a gang.
The confirmation that Hakan committed suicide turned the eyes to the violent Metin2.
Metin2, which was banned by the Antalya Governorate last year for children under 15, was criticized for causing addiction and violence among children, and was again brought to the fore in 2009 with the murder of 13-year-old "mini hacker" Metin Kang.
To play "Metin2", which was designed in Korea in 2005, you need to log in and register as a member.
Players attempt to bring peace and justice to the world through the dragon god in the game.
And while we're doing this, there's wars, there's an increase in violence.
The game features scenes of warfare with cutting, piercing weapons such as lines, swords, machetes, and axes, as well as scenes of people being torn apart by wild animals and devoured.
The actor buys characters with money to get stronger.
The family who had their children crushed the next day after the incident in the house in Köknar Street in Esenyurt İstiklal neighborhood continued the murder claim.
"The whole dream was to become a doctor, we don't think he could harm himself or anyone else because of the game", said Mehmet Ekinci, "They put an elastic bandage around his neck and knot him on the side".
That's how he was found, son.
We certainly don't think that our son could hurt himself or anyone else or commit suicide because of an online game.
We knew you were playing a game like that.
It wasn't a game he was playing.
Let's say he gets a little bored and he lets it go.
Anne Gülizar Ekinci said, "No one goes in or out of the building".
They say my son came in at a certain time.
None of them hold each other.
When his brother came home, he only had one chair.
"But when they found his body, there were two chairs next to the computer", he said.
Ilker KARAŞ: He may be involved in the gang
Families generally don't pay attention to this.
They're like, "My kid's home, no matter what".
The child communicates with many people through games.
There may have been a borrowing-borrowing situation, or a profanity.
Or he invited someone from the play into the house, and they had a problem.
It could have been influenced by the problems he had with other people he was communicating with through the game, not directly from the game.
The visuals of the play, the fantasy, the child may have taken it for granted.
The trauma that led to the suicide could be related to blackmail.
If the child faces a situation of complaining to the parents, he is also in a state of depression because he cannot solve the problem.
He couldn't have killed himself because of the play itself.
There's also the possibility that the kid might be involved with a gang.
He could be in a gang.
It's not something that the individual child could have done alone.
Information systems consultant Füsun NEBİL: Parents should know their children's interaction
We can't say that games are harmful.
Research also suggests that games are beneficial for children's development.
What's important here is that parents watch what their kids play and how they interact with players online.
Parents should be aware of the potential impact of such material on their children and take precautions.
In Turkey, only two children have died from gambling in the last five years.
Which shows that the end of a child's life is not just the effect of games.
What was it that drove this boy to do that?
We need to find out first.
You have to look at the sociology and psychology around the child.
8 months' yield at the Istanbul stock exchange stood at 50 percent
The BIST 100 index continued its upward trend in July, which began in December 2016 and moved its rise to the 8th month in a row.
The index thus gained 45.3 percent for the first time since July 2007 and recorded an eight-month consecutive increase.
The BIST 100 index, which has outperformed the major stock exchanges of the world, including Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, in terms of performance since the beginning of the year, did not leave the lead in July on the basis of returns.
The BIST 100 index, which completed July with a 7.06 percent rise, was followed by the Dow Jones index in the US with a 2.54 percent rise, and the FTSE 100 index in the UK with a 0.81 percent rise.
The DAX index in Germany and the Nikkei index in Japan finished July with a loss.
The BIST 100 index was a stronger performer than both major world and emerging market indices as of January-July.
The BIST 100 index, which gained 37.6 percent at the end of 2016, was followed by the Dow Jones index with a 10.76 percent increase, the DAX index with a 5.55 percent increase, the Nikkei index with a 4.55 percent increase, and the FTSE 100 index with a 3.21 percent increase.
The MSCI EM index, which is an indicator of the emerging market, yielded 23 percent.
Looking at the historical trend of the BIST 100 index, it has shown similar performance in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which last completed 8 consecutive months between December 2006 and July 2007, had recorded a 38.3 percent increase in value during this period.
The BIST 100 index was completed by gaining value in eight months between August 1996 and March 1997, and nine months between May 1997 and January 1998.
In a statement to the AA, Eren Can Umüt, Director of Investment Research at Meksa, said that the BIST 100 index has been rising for 8 months, and that the increase has exceeded 37 percent since the beginning of the year.
Umut noted that the MSCI emerging markets (EM) index recorded a 23 percent increase, even if we look at these rates alone, there is a positive divergence:
The flow of funds to developing countries has been ongoing since the beginning of the year.
Especially funds in the high-yield search are preferring countries with higher interest rates.
Domestic markets are affected positively by this situation.
And of course, the global appetite for risk is very high.
This has led to a surge in the demand for risky asset-backed stock indices.
In the U.S., we see new record levels tested almost every week, in parallel with the S&P 500's nearly 11 percent increase since Christmas.
He noted that the Fed's 3 percent increase earlier this year had put the markets under stress, but the Fed's policy of verbal guidance had been very good at eliminating uncertainty.
Hope said that inflation in the US is not yet at the desired level, and that the expectations that the Fed will not act hastily on interest rate hikes and avoid radical moves are also very effective in current pricing.
"Although Trump's expectations of a faster US economy have had a positive impact on the stock market for a period, the failure to deliver on the promises is strengthening the hand of the Fed and the market in terms of faster growth and a response to faster inflation", Umut said.
He noted that 2016 was a year of many negative developments in the Turkish markets and said that he was trying to close the gap between the negative and over-sold BIST 100 index.
He said that the current situation could be interpreted as a trigger for the desire to close the gap between the increase in risk appetite abroad and similar domestic markets.
Umut said that he was seeing some profit sales in the BIST 100 index, which technically tested new records at 108,600 levels:
Especially the 109,500-110,000 area is a critical threshold in the short term.
It's normal for profit sales to occur after it's near these levels.
We think that in the short term, a new story, local or global, needs to be created for the 110,000-plus pricing.
A downward shift from the current 107,500 support could trigger a profit sale.
So, we're tracking the 107,000 intermediate support, but I think we're seeing a loosening to the 106,000-105,500 area.
In particular, breaking the 105,500 support could lead to a pullback to 104,300, which is equivalent to Fibo 50 percent of the rise from 100,000 to 108,600.
Asserting that both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) decisions will be the focus of the global market, Umut said that expectations for the Fed are already clear, but that the possibility of a balance sheet reduction program going into effect in September may trigger a strengthening in the US dollar, although no interest rate increase is expected in the FOMC.
Hopefully, this could trigger short-term profits in the emerging market (ED) stock indices, which are in the shadow of overbought, "but what is more important is what the ECB will say".
Following the July monetary policy council meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi said he would discuss the course of monetary policy in the autumn, prompting the euro/dollar parity to rise above 1,1700 levels.
So announcements that the €60 billion monthly asset purchase program will be reduced or may be terminated will mean that global post-Fed liquidity will also be reduced by the ECB.
"Therefore, negative pricing may occur on behalf of markets such as Turkey, which provides high current and access to foreign funds is mandatory".
Gedik Investment Investment Advisory Director Erol Gürcan also noted that in November 2016, after Trump was elected president in the United States, there was a very serious rally in the global stock markets.
Gürcan noted that the main element that triggered this rally movement was the development of global growth expectations, including Trump's promises to reduce taxes:
The Istanbul Stock Exchange also topped the list of the leading exchanges in the global rally.
While one of the main reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has remained relatively unchanged in recent years compared to similar emerging market markets, it is worth noting that steps taken by policymakers to support the economy and financial markets have also played a significant role.
In particular, the Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF), which became active in March, has had a significant impact on the rise in the index observed so far.
The positive developments in the rest of the year were reflected in the pricing and the KGF, which played an important role in this rise, gradually reached satisfaction, Gürcan said, although the BIST 100 index still remains in the background compared to similar markets, the search for a new story may come to the fore for the rest of the year.
The 180-day action plan, which has been awaited with interest for some time, the increase of the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, the making of regulations to support the company's profits, the possible tax reduction that has come up in the near future, may make a positive contribution in this regard.
The ECB and the Bank of England (BoE) are among the key risk factors for developing countries, stressing that the Fed, which has been continuing moderate interest rate increases for some time, will most likely start the balance sheet reduction process after September, the ECB's possibility of ending the asset purchase program in the near future and the possibility of the BOE being one of the major developed country central banks that will increase interest rates after the Fed.
He said that the 104.150-104.600 support zone, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average, is critical in the possible correction movements in the index in the coming period, which corresponds to the upward trend seen since the beginning of the year.
The Georgian said that if the current upward trend is maintained and the current historical peak of 108.605 resistance is broken, the index could rise to 110.000-112.000 range.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
Authorities say a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
NATO said five soldiers and a translator were wounded.
Unconfirmed local sources say three civilians were killed in the incident in the Karabakh region of the city.
The bombing was the latest act of violence in Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said the blast on Thursday evening was a joint patrol mission with the Afghan army, with a "personally guided hand-made explosive".
The statement said all the injured were in good condition and were being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
Reporters say the Taliban's growing power and the group known as Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh are a major concern for NATO forces based near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths, with an average of 20% in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite area of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people in the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs in on whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the military and police in the country.
Reporters say suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have led to a crisis in public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA stopped delaying the air pollution rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has come back from a day late decision to delay an Obama-era law requiring states to curb emissions of dirty smoke, with 15 states suing the agency for the initiative.
The EPA announced late Wednesday its decision to proceed with the "2015 Ozone Resolutions", saying the organization showed its commitment to working with states.
EPA President Scott Pruitt said in a statement, "We believe in dialogue with our state partners and being sensitive to them".
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA would delay its ozone decisions by one year until October 2018, with current dirty smoke pollution measured in various parts of the country and where cutting is mandatory to meet stricter air quality standards.
Fifteen states, mostly Democrats, and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is continuing its quest to reverse a wide range of environmental regulations enacted by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump calls to revive economic growth.
But these efforts have led to a backlash from Democrats and conservative groups concerned about the public health effects of more emissions.
The EPA website says that breathing ozone-containing air "may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma".
The forest has given us good news...
It's time for the stop and wing transfer!
Beşiktaş President Fikret Orman made statements to Bein Sports about the transfer of the Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and the stoper.
Fikret Orman said that...
No surprises on the transfer.
We're not looking for a lot of transfers, we're looking for a point.
Now we're going to do a stop and wing transfer.
We've got Champions League games, so hopefully we'll get a good draw.
We'll have to make a forced wing transfer.
10 million euros is easy, but we don't have a budget.
If it comes to our budget, we'll transfer, and if we don't, we won't die.
I can't give you any information until we're clear on the lens.
We're a publicly traded company.
The end of patience is peace.
Is the threat of ISIS only for August 30th, or for the festival?
Reactions continue to the Ankara Governorate's ban on all public events, including concerts, commemorative meetings and similar events throughout August, on the grounds of "ISIS threat".
The governor's decision to ban "all mass events" is included in the statement.
The Grand International Festival of Ankara is going on.
In a statement to SÖZCÜ, CHP Group Vice President and Ankara MP Levent Gök said: "It is not even possible that 30 August will be affected by the bans".
There's a serious confusion.
Even the governor is hesitant about which decision to make...
The state's job is to create the space for the celebrations.
Murat Emir, a deputy of the CHP Ankara, said: "The security problem of all Ankara is there, only the security problems of the Gökçek organizations are not there".
Ankara's Independent MP Aylin Nazlıaka has moved the ban to the parliament.
Asking for the Prime Minister's response, Nazlıaka suggested, "Does this ban not clearly show the AKP's anti-republican and Atatürk hostility? How do you think to prevent the millions who will celebrate August 30 in the fields?"
"I learned from Edwina myself that I was deceived"
Demet Shener, who is in the process of divorce with Ibrahim Kutluay, was in Nishantaşı with his lawyer Aslı Hatemi the day before.
Schener, who sued Edwina Sponza for moral damages for allegedly destroying her home, had presented photos of Sponza and Kutluay together as evidence.
The social beauty Sponza had also filed a criminal complaint against Sener, saying, "Demet illegally obtained my private photographs".
'I Didn't Know I Could'
After this latest development, Schener met with his lawyer at the Nişantaşı Delicatessen, and when he saw the reporters, he left the place.
When the cheerful Schener was reminded of Edwina Sponza's claim about the photos, she laughed and said, "Oh my God, I must have broken into your house and taken them".
Asli Hatemi de Sponza's complaint: "There is such a complaint but the content is not correct".
"We have everything, we have submitted it to the court", he said.
"Recently, everyone knew your wife was having an affair with Sponza".
"How did you not know?" he was very surprised.
What's that?
What's that?
"I swear", said Shener, "I didn't know whether to believe my husband who looked me in the eye or the gossip of my entourage".
When the reporters insisted, "Have you never heard?" Shener, who initially said "No", continued: "I have not, of course I heard it the first time".
But I didn't believe in any of that.
Everything was normal, in place, nothing to suspect.
Ma'am, I learned everything when you sent it to me, so...
"Yes", he replied, and confused the court by claiming that the photographs and correspondence he had submitted had been sent to him by Sponza himself.
Sponza had previously claimed that his correspondence with Ibrahim Kutluay was a montage.
Beşiktaş will sign a contract with Negredo tomorrow
The Beşiktaş Club will officially add Spanish footballer Alvaro Negredo to their squad tomorrow.
The signing ceremony for Negredo, where Beşiktaş has agreed in principle on the transfer with Valencia Club of Spain, will be held at Vodafone Park.
The signing ceremony, which will be attended by club president Fikret Orman, will take place at 12:00.
By the way, the Spanish footballer will also have a medical check-up tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke the embargo in hours thanks to Turkey
Qatari Minister of Economy and Trade Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani expressed his gratitude to the Turkish people.
Al Thani: "Thank you very much for your honorable attitude and support".
I also send greetings from the Emir of Qatar to my brother President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Qatari economy has proven resilient.
Our economy is solid, while many countries' economies are being negatively affected.
We must work hard to make Qatar independent and strong.
We broke the embargo against us in a matter of hours, thanks largely to Turkey.
We're not short on anything right now.
Our natural resources, natural gas exports, are a big boost to Qatar's economy.
We were not affected by the blocking, which was carried out against us in a cruel and unlawful manner, thanks to Turkey.
Today, Qatar is once again continuing its global production of natural gas and LNG.
"After the residents, we experienced an increase of 30 percent in our natural gas exports, not a decrease", he said.
Al Thani said that the brotherly relations between Qatar and Turkey continue in all areas and that "the volume of trade between us amounted to 554 million dollars in the first quarter".
Recent decisions have played a major role in this.
As a result of the Turkish products' success in the Qatari market, the acceleration of the import of goods from Turkey in all sectors and the investment in many areas is extremely important for us.
"I thank you very much for your upbuilding attitude toward us", he said.
The cost of the recent disasters is 300 million TL
The president of the TSB, Can Akın Çağlar, said that after the flood on July 18, 7 thousand damage reports were made to insurance companies worth 116 million TL, 12 million lira 800 damage reports were received in the Gökova earthquake on July 21 and 22 thousand damage reports came in Istanbul on July 27 in the flood and flood of 168 million lira, and the cost of insurance for the last three events was 300 million lira.
"In terms of the insurance of Kasko, the damage caused by the flood is about 3,500 lira per vehicle, and the damage to the glass is about 1,000 lira".
"The average damage to the house was 6,000 lire", he said.
He said that the sector is making intensive efforts to compensate for economic losses, stating that 3 out of every 4 people do not have housing insurance, 1 out of every 2 businesses do not have fire insurance and 2 out of every 3 people do not have casco insurance, and said: "The risk of natural disasters is increasing due to climate change".
The risk of incurring serious damage costs to our citizens and institutions is increasing every day due to the low insurance rates in our country.
These costs should not be left entirely to the state.
Insurance policies aren't as expensive as you might think, and insurance is not just a loss-paying industry; it's also a risk-management consulting business.
Increasing insurance awareness and insurance coverage is vital for our people and our country.
"In the general conditions of Kasko insurance, insured persons are required to report their damages within 5 working days, and this period ended yesterday".
"Will the insured be a victim?" He replied: "In general, there is such a period, but in the Commercial Law, the time limit is 2 years".
"And this is a natural disaster, so insurers don't have to panic, no company says, 'I'm not paying.'"
That's how the German media saw the giant bid!
At a time of increased tensions between Turkey and Germany, the German company Siemens won the first tender for Turkey's Wind Energy Renewable Energy Sources (YEKA) area.
German media reported this development with the words "German Siemens won the giant tender in Turkey".
DWelle Turkish reported that the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon consortium won the YEKA tender, saying: "The consortium will invest in wind power plants worth over 1 billion dollars".
The number of companies competing in the tender today fell from 8 to 2, the Chinese consortium Mingyang German and Siemens faced each other, and the Chinese consortium Mingyang withdrew from the tender at the start of the 30th round.
After the tender, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak made striking statements about Turkey-Germany relations.
The bid was won by the German company Siemens, and we can say that this painting is an important message to the region and the world.
In terms of the 200 years of historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think this result will make a significant contribution to the Turkish-German relations.
I am proud to show that no matter how many regional crises there are in the world, Turkey is at the forefront of the region and the world's most reliable countries to invest in.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible contest
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are set to cross paths to showcase the most satisfying boxing match of the near future for 147 pounds six, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
In a Saturday showtime vote, both fighters are among the top five members of the unattended list, after Garcia defeated former four-cycle world champion Adrien Broner.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you".
Lomachenko is defending his belt against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN Saturday night at 7:00.
While the pair posed for photos, Lomochenko's manager Egis Klimar recorded that a potential match between the fighters would be "perfectly sized".
Garcia made the "I fucked an old feather" reminder.
"I went up for broner (140 pounds), but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get off the bike.
He's got to go to lightweight, then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this".
Lomachenko has joined.
"Boxing needs this fight".
Klimas asked if it should be on 'pay and watch'; setting a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer and having Lomachenko fight in a 135 lb opening match within the year is part of his strategy; Garcia is also interested in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell bout for the lightweight title at the Forum on 23 September.
Garcia said, "The fight could be on pay-and-watch because that's what all the fans want". And then he said that he was open to whoever offered the best financial package.
We're the main names.
No other name has attracted this much attention.
When they're ready...
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as a "great fighter" and that he could attend his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko hesitated to kneel to Garcia for the bountiful praise, saying he thought the three Riverside cycling champions looked "too slow", "sorry, Mikey... you wanted the knockout".
Garcia said the focus was on showing punch first and then boxing.
They both said they felt the momentum was being created for their encounters.
"This is a fight that needs to be fought.
No other fight has generated so much interest and rumor.
Garcia said, "I'm very happy to be doing this".
Lomachenko said: "I was waiting for the best fighters and that was Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight".
The Turkish Rust from Russia to America
The White House is not considering imposing sanctions that would affect Moscow's pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia could increase the cost of these lines.
And that's because the cost of borrowing is going up.
Worried that Western investment partners might consider withdrawing from the projects due to sanctions, the Kremlin in turn hastened the construction of the pipelines.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which is planning to build the Turkish Stream line, which is planned to reach Turkey from under the Black Sea, has accelerated the construction at the request of Gazprom.
Reuters reported that Gazprom has also begun construction of a second pipeline parallel to the Turkish Stream "with haste" to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment test released
The latest results of a new medical age assessment test for refugees in Sweden found that more than 80 percent of the participants were over the age of 18, but not everyone is confident in the accuracy of the tests.
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine and Medicines Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the age assessment in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized the failure of some refugees who claimed to be underage to assess their age correctly.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test and the Forensic Medicine and Pharmaceuticals Department has now released the results of 2481 of the tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (out of 2002) were judged to be 18 or over, and in 25 cases the Office of Forensic Medicine and Pharmaceuticals ruled that the subject was "probably 18 and over".
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "probably under 18".
Tests were only done in cases where the person's age was suspected.
Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine and Pharmaceutical Department says the results are consistent with the past few months.
He told The Local, "We don't see a big difference in the statistics from the previous months, the numbers are pretty consistent".
The high rate of cases that are judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that refugees are lying about their age.
In May, the department released the results of 581 tests, and said there were 442 cases "in which the subjects examined were shown to be 18 years of age or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reviewed the results of 581 cases reported, it found that 243 cases openly stated that they had turned 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method, which involves taking X-rays of 20-year-old teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, and then having them analyzed by dentists and radiologists, is criticized in some circles.
One skeptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, who has been studying the biological maturity of humans to determine whether they enter puberty earlier or later than normal.
"I have reasons to think about it, and I think that this is not the kind of measurement that should be used.
It's very questionable to judge biological age in this way.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend to be", he told Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine and Pharmaceuticals Department defended the accuracy of the tests: "You can say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is generally small.
The greatest risk is that the person is just under 18, and in this case the risk is about 10 percent".
The Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque is being opened for worship today
The Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque, built by Abdülhamit in 1885 for architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened for worship today with Friday prayers after restoration work.
Regional Director Mürsel Sari said that the restoration work that began in June 2013 has been completed and the mosque has been made ready for the opening.
Yellow gave the following information: "Restoration works were carried out in two scope".
The first part was the renovation of the mosque, the main building.
The second part was the landscaping.
The first part was about 16 million lira, and the environmental planning was about 11 million lira.
First, the wooden dome was opened, after they were renewed, the outer walls were cleaned of dirt, rust, and external factors.
Drainage was done on the stabilization.
As we entered the mosque, there were rich ornaments.
It's a work of star motifs, and it's very rich in pencil work.
There's a mixed style here.
"The traces of the cellulite are also visible, and if we consider that it was built in 1885 by the Ottomans, the baroque style has also become an element in the architecture".
There is a job for the United States.
"The owl found in the center of the mosque is German Emperor II".
It was partially broken, renovated, cleaned and hung in place.
It's a really valuable and important piece.
On either side of the mosque are symmetrical wooden cages called salutes.
We know that these were made by our great khan, Abdulhamit Khan, who built the mosque himself.
So we know how he did it himself and how he put it here.
They're still standing here in their original form.
Sarı said that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to attend the opening ceremony of the mosque.
The Pantic claim in Göztepe
The Ukrainian press reported that the 25-year-old Serbian footballer, who could not make the squad at Dinoma Kiev, could be loaned to the yellow-red club.
Having started his football career with Red Star in his native Serbia, Pantic has played in Spain for Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves.
Pantic signed for Dinamo Kiev in the middle of last season.
The governor of West Virginia has announced his party change.
West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced his party change at a rally with President Trump Thursday night.
Governor Justice said, "Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have abandoned me".
"I'm going to tell you today, with many prayers and thoughts... "and I'm going to tell you today, as citizens of West Virginia, "that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor".
The rally was overwhelmed with cheers.
Justice added, "So I'm going to change my registration to Republican tomorrow".
"If I was a technical director, I'd tell you it's time to make a different game".
Mr. Trump had promised to make a major announcement earlier at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Democratic nominee Justice did not endorse Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes reports that he owns coal mines in five states with his coal business he inherited from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Convention issued a statement Thursday evening saying that "Governor Justice's party switching is another blow to the Democratic Party, which prefers to work to prevent it rather than make our country great again".
RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS, "With only 15 governors and the fewest state legislatures in history in control, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from the top down and unable to find a positive, unifying message".
I'll do what's best for Turkey
Olympic third, Turkish record holder.
Born in Cuba, but he came to Turkey for F. Bahçe and made it his homeland...
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and wore the national uniform...
First he became European champion, then Olympic third...
Now he's one of Turkey's top medal hopes at the World Championships in Athletics.
Yasmani Capello, who competes in the 400-meter hurdles, spoke to SAAM before the championship, which starts today.
They didn't want you in Cuba when you were young because they didn't like your degrees.
You've improved with a coach.
Then they called, but you didn't go.
Some people think you chose Turkey for the money.
What are you saying?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was leaving the national team.
And from that moment on, I can draw a line between what I've been through and what I've been through.
Then I came to Turkey at the invitation of the Fenerbahçe club.
I got into the national team thanks to Fenerbahçe.
They offered me a deal for reinforcements.
I've started a new chapter with Turkey.
I was disabled in my youth, but after the opportunities offered to me in Turkey, I achieved great success in Rio and Amsterdam.
I can't wait to do my best at the World Championships in Athletics and win a different title.
You cried at the press conference the other day.
Can you tell us why?
Whenever a question is asked about Turkey's adoption of me, I think of my childhood, of being kicked off the Cuban national team at 23.
And of course, people in Turkey are coming to me.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt the same way when the National Anthem was played.
I couldn't hold back my tears.
I am grateful to Turkey for giving me the opportunity to realize my dreams.
I'm so happy to be part of the Turkish national team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said earlier that you might have a Turkish boyfriend.
You're with a Turk now, you went to Cuba together.
You want to share your experience?
The greatest advantage of being with a Turk is the calm...
Compared to Cuban women, peace...
Turkish girls have their affairs.
Your girlfriend is also your assistant coach.
You're together all day, like, does it interfere with your eating?
He eats more dessert than I do.
(Both laugh) I'm not really on a strict diet, but sometimes it gets in the way of my eating.
My coach, Massimo Matrone, has often issued harsh warnings about my diet, but I know it's for my own good.
How's your Turkish food, does your girlfriend cook for you?
Turkish women make great food, but my girlfriend makes better.
(Laughter) Dried beans and rice is my first choice.
I just laughed at him.
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He replaced me with other kids.
We met in Cuba after winning medals for Turkey.
He looked me in the face, pointed me to the young athletes next to him, and said, "Look, I raised him".
I just laughed at him.
I 'm angry with you .
The glasses you wear at the races...
I'm just using it for concentration.
The moment I put on the glasses, I cut myself off from the world and build walls on both sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
What comes to your mind when we say Tokyo 2020?
Felix Sanchez is the...
At the 2012 London Olympics, she won the gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles at the age of 35.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at 33.
It 's a turkish-language support .
Turkcell's Deputy General Manager Ismail All said that they believe Yasmani Capello will be successful in London, "We sincerely believe that Yasmani will represent our flag in the best way in this championship".
We wish all our athletes success in London.
"We will continue to support the further development of Turkish athletics and bring greater success to our country", he said.
Coe praises Russia's "sincere" apology for the doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the global athletics boss, hailed Russia's apology for the doping scandal, which he described as sincere, but stressed that the time was not right for the country to be reinstated in the sport.
Russia's athletics patron Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that it was right that his country was banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he apologized to "all athletes who were forced to take away their gold and silver medals in the competitions".
Despite its own assessments, the IAAF Congress voted to keep the ban after a November 2015 World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
IAAF president Coe told reporters, "I think today was a very cordial response, a very cordial presentation".
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation had accepted him, that he had survived the most turbulent days and that he had done everything possible to ensure the reconstruction of the federation"...
Coe also said he was "pleased" that Russia accepted his re-admission criteria.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think it's a step in the right direction, but Congress supports the suggestion that the mandate is not the right time to return Russia's rights", Coe said.
"We must do everything to normalize this situation in the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been to want to separate clean athletes from the flawed system".
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict IAAF criteria will compete in the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday.
IAAF task force chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia had not yet met many criteria for the return of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still insufficient and that the banned trainers were still working freely.
Denying the US news of 'YPG's tanks'
The US Embassy in Ankara has announced that no tanks have been delivered to any of the fighting parties in Syria.
The YPG denied that they had sent hundreds of troops with tanks and weapons.
In a statement from the embassy, entitled "Declaration on the false news in the press about the migrants going to Syria", it said:
In a series of false reports in the press over the past few days, it has been falsely claimed that the US has sent hundreds of tanks and armoured vehicles to Syria to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some basic facts about the current situation in Syria.
The U.S. has not supplied tanks to any group fighting against ISIS in Syria.
Much of the US military aid, primarily in light weapons and ammunition, supports elements of the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAC) within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
Syrian Arabs, including the SAK, are fighting to clear Deasi from the area and regain their homes.
TYDTA President Ermut: Foreign direct investment will be higher than last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said that 55 percent of all investments came after July last year.
Ermut said that investments were not decreasing due to the coup attempt on July 15 but were increasing, "Maybe there would have been more increase, he hit ket".
Maybe if these conditions hadn't occurred, if some regional improvements hadn't happened, we would have seen more of a dramatic increase.
That's why we're more optimistic about next year.
I hope it's a brighter year for direct investment.
And we're already up 11 percent in the first five months compared to the first five months of last year.
But we don't think that's enough.
"We hope there will be more", he said.
"We are not worried about global or regional developments", Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut, recalling that normally by 2010 75 percent of direct investments came from Europe, continued:
That number has dropped to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share went from 2 percent to 7 to 8 percent.
Russia's share has increased.
And while we were trying to do that, the Gulf countries had some problems with each other.
Turkey has good relations with all of them, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar, two important players.
But the problem between these two countries is that it's upsetting us and it's causing investors to put off their decisions a little bit longer.
Not just in terms of investments in Turkey, but we may be experiencing some delays as a result.
Arda Ermut recalled that some incidents happened in Germany last week, but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, reacted clearly and decisively to this situation.
When investors from countries experiencing the most severe political crisis spoke, President Erdogan's reaction was, "Look, problems happen between governments, not between people at all".
Second, these people came and invested in my country.
These are no different to us than Turkish companies.
On the contrary, they'll come to us with the slightest problem, and we'll solve it.
"We will definitely not let them be victims". Ermut said that they continue to support all investors with the comfort of this.
Ermut said, "We can guarantee that in the future".
You'll see that neither German companies nor investors from countries where we have some political problems will have any problems.
On the contrary, I hope we will do our best to increase investment from these countries.
We think the investment coming in here will continue to grow.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions of the investment climate.
"But we will do our best at this point, and we will do our best to ensure that our investors and the perception of the investment environment are not affected".
TYDTA President Ermut said that after the one generation one road strategy, Turkey has started to receive great interest from China, but if the problems in the Gulf are solved, they expect the largest investment from the Gulf.
"In the relations with Germany, there is not a single investor who says, 'We suffered because of these relations, because of this incident we had investments, we are running away.' " Ermut, who used his words, noted that companies came, came and followed them.
Ermut said, "At the moment, about 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies".
So almost 10 percent of the companies we interviewed from around the world are German companies.
Some of them are companies that already have investments in Turkey.
He's either gonna increase his investment or he's got a subject, and we're keeping it open as a project.
"So German companies are still a significant part of our daily business flow", he said.
Ermut stressed that all state institutions should be careful in the period when detection operations are carried out in Turkey, and expressed that the issue is sensitive and can be affected by the slightest bad communication.
Ermut said that the events of the past 2-3 weeks were a good lesson:
Investors and politicians always have different agendas.
We've always seen that economic relations always set political developments in some way.
Germany will remain an important trading partner and an important investor.
Because they already have a lot of investments in Turkey.
Unfortunately, the election agenda in Germany is increasing this kind of discourse.
I think they'll be a little more up to speed when they're gone.
In the case of Saudi Arabia, the two countries are careful not to make negative statements.
So an investor investing in Turkey is investing in all the markets of the surrounding countries.
So there's been a bit of a slowdown, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region.
But we're still in talks with these investors.
My personal opinion is that investors are waiting for a decision that they might be able to make faster.
We don't have a Saudi investor who says, 'I see uncertainty in the negative sense because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, I'm leaving here.'
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who still live in Turkey, who visit us while they are on holiday, and we follow them through the whole process.
Arda Ermut recalled that last year, international direct investments (UDY) in Turkey amounted to 12.3 billion dollars, "I think we will definitely exceed that this year.
"But how far we go, these regional developments, global uncertainties will affect".
While he hoped that the impact would be more, perhaps a little more limited, Ermut said that the growth rate was 11 percent in the first five months, indicating that it could be maintained, "I hope that if there is no bad development, I believe that one way or another we will close the year better than last year".
He said that a significant part of the investments will continue to be in real estate, and that new investments could be seen in logistics, healthcare, fintech, information technology, petrochemicals, food, energy and manufacturing.
He also stressed that new investments will be announced in the coming months, "We may have an investment announcement in the manufacturing sense in the near future".
It's not a billion dollars, but it's a big investment.
"There could be investments from other countries that are interested", he said.
Operation in 9 districts: 55 arrested
The teams of the Istanbul Branch of Combating Smuggling Crimes Department found that the foil covering the mushroom tapes on the products sold by 4 wine companies was long and loose, and the bandrels were not glued to the bottle, and the TAPDK bandrels were collected after the products were sold and marketed by attaching them to newly produced wines.
The team has argued that the government has lost $20.4 million in tax revenue due to the repeated use of the suspects' banners.
Police teams conducted simultaneous operations at 55 addresses, including the factories and warehouses of 4 wine firms in Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdag, Bursa, Balıkesir, Manisa, Aydın, Denizli and Nevşehir.
A total of 55 people were detained during the operation, and 15 thousand ready-to-sell wine, 52 thousand 480 bottles of wine with TAPDK bandroll cap, 12 thousand 890 TAPDK bandroll caps, 3 guns and bullets, 100 boxes of sexual pills, 992 smuggled cigars, 698 bottles of various types of fake liquor and 100 liters of an anason essence were seized.
The 55 people detained were brought to the Directorate of the Department of Combating Smuggling Crimes in Vatan Street.
Security procedures for the suspects are ongoing.
The operation of their teams in factories, warehouses and workplaces was captured on police cameras.
Police teams searched a warehouse and were seen removing the lids from the sale of wine bottles.
Police teams have been investigating TAPDK-banded hoods filled with bags of used bottles.
How will the financial rules of football affect Neymar's trip to Paris?
Rules to prevent unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris Saint Germain in France.
From UEFA, the governing body that oversees the European game, to Paris Saint-Germain, the prestigious Champions League tournament, which has the power to block teams, can have any kind of outcome.
The Financial Fair Play rules issued by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that it financed Neymar's transfer without suffering huge losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will command a salary of tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some of the financial aspects of Neymar's trip to France are:
Given the team's money from an energy-rich Qatari family, PSG could of course pay to sign Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on players, but they have to balance that with legitimate sources of income, provided they are successful in their football-related business.
The FFP was conceived by Michel Platini, following his election to the UEFA presidency in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that were heavily in debt in pursuit of success were active in fraud and were at risk of bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP began to monitor clubs' losses rather than focusing on their debts.
The change meant that the model Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 (buy a club with potential, spend heavily to improve the team, and build a global brand) became a more challenging venture.
In the three-year FFP evaluation period that runs until 2018, clubs can suffer losses of 30 million euros.
Despite Platini's disgraceful removal from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksander Cefer, is still determined to avoid overspending.
Andrea Traverso, who runs the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "The FFP is definitely not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules by moving forward".
Although PSG will pay Neymar's purchase price in full, for accounting reasons, the amount can be spread over the contract period.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer fee can be shown in the next five years' annual accounts as a cost of €44.4 million.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw the heaviest sanctions imposed on PSG and Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
PSG were subsequently fined 60 million euros ($82 million for the time) which was reduced to 20 million euros, and ordered to limit the Champions League squad to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is on the alert against clubs that may try to defraud financial regulators by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the club's owners.
Although a Qatari company may sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market values, UEFA will not allow it to be considered as legitimate income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Authority's sponsorship of PSG was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar's earnings from PSG could come through payments to Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar have denied Neymar will be the 2022 World Cup ambassador, and such a move could easily be revealed by UEFA organisers.
The sanctions imposed on PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be even more cautious against attempts to circumvent the rules.
According to sources, UEFA is not in a preventive negotiation with PSG over Neymar's transfer.
Since they were not authorized to discuss the situation of PSG, they spoke to The Associated Press on condition of secrecy.
The latest published calculations show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Last year's accounts have not been released yet.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to contribute to sponsorship deals, gift and jersey sales.
The club expects the turnover to increase by at least 30 percent once the signing is done.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of football's greatest players, tried to block Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG had violated the FFP.
La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS that Qatar is the definitive owner of PSG, saying: "This is an open 'financial doping' case with the club and the state".
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports giant, shares his concern about La Liga being financed by a state.
Wenger said on Thursday: "It's a result of having and it's completely changed the whole ground of football over the last 15 years".
"Once a country has a club, anything is possible.
It's very difficult to respect Financial Fair Play because for one country, having such a big player representing one country can lead to different methods or different interests.
The 'price ceiling' revolt from insurers
According to the TSB, the insurance sector has been losing money in the traffic industry since 2006.
In 2015, the sector lost 2.35 billion TL, and in 2016 it made only 19 million TL in profit.
Aksigorta, Anadolu Insurance and Sun Insurance are trading in the Istanbul Stock Exchange.
Speaking at the meeting where the TSB evaluated the results of the first six months of 2017, Çağlar said that the 11-year loss in traffic insurance reached 7.3 billion TL, and that they predicted that the loss of the sector this year will increase to 2.3 billion TL with the application of the ceiling premium, the estimated damage-premium ratio to 125 percent.
This year, the number of people will be caught, noting that the damage recorded in 2012 and 2015 also took the profits of other branches, "This means that by financing the bad driver, we are increasing the price of the citizen's housing policy".
"75 percent of the sector is foreign, and our partners abroad are financing the bad driver in some way", he said.
The Ages, he continued:
We don't expect to make a profit on traffic, but looking back over the last 11 years, we've never shown a profit in any year.
"We accept that, but we hope that we can bear the loss in a reasonable environment, along with other policies", he said.
"In 2012, traffic insurance increased by about 30 percent, almost doubled in 2015, we recorded the biggest loss in our history", said Çağlar, who said that the damage in traffic took the profitability of other products.
"Even in an environment where prices have increased so much, at the end of 2016 our traffic profit was only 19 million TL", he said.
Saying that they expect the free tariff to be passed next year, the Generals said, "We will lower the price of the good driver in the free tariff and apply a high price to the bad driver".
"But the Treasury is looking at the general trend, and the final say on when it will be is with the Treasury".
The Treasury Department stated that the increase in the premiums of compulsory traffic insurance from 2015 affected a wide section of the society, and that the maximum premium (ceiling price) was implemented from April 12.
Accordingly, the maximum premiums for compulsory traffic insurance policies were determined on the basis of the provincial groups determined taking into account the number and traffic density and accident statistics of each vehicle group.
On the other hand, the "Risk Insurance Pool" was implemented for high-frequency vehicles in compulsory traffic insurance from July.
The premiums and damages for pool-covered traffic insurance policies will be shared among the insurance companies.
The premiums of these policyholders will be determined by the Treasury Department.
He said that with the implementation of the ceiling premium, the production of premiums in traffic in the first 6 months of 2017 decreased by 11.5 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, while the number of policies increased by 4.9 percent to 8.6 million, and when inflation is taken into account, the reduction in traffic policies reached about 30 percent.
This year, the traffic will again take profits in other industries, said Aglar, "This damage cannot be sustained at these ceiling prices.
How much more can the industry take?"
He said that the capital of all companies in the sector is 9 billion TL, and that the capital of the sector will be finished in three years when only 2.3 billion TL is damaged by traffic, "The foreigners are looking at 'Why does the good driver finance the bad driver, why do my thousands of shareholders finance the bad driver in Turkey?' "
"We're trying to tell the Treasury what's wrong with us at this point", he said.
Asked whether foreigners have reached the point of reducing their weight in the Turkish insurance sector after these developments, Çağlar said, "They have not yet reached that point".
They expect to invest more in Turkey because in the Netherlands, the average per capita policy is down 6 times, while in Turkey, it's down 1.3.
"So Turkey is a place that really needs to grow", he said, and continued:
So they didn't give up on this place.
But even though the company makes a reasonable profit every year, it keeps all the profits in the company and uses them to grow the company.
According to the TSB data, in 2016, the premium production in the sector amounted to 40.5 billion TL, while in the first half of this year, it amounted to 23.1 billion TL, an increase of 12 percent compared to the same period last year.
The Times said it predicted the industry would not finish the year with a 15 percent increase in total premium production.
The good news of social welfare for thousands of chronically ill people
The details and principles of implementation of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Struggling with Chronic Diseases" were revealed by the Minister of Family and Social Policies Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya.
The social assistance program for poor citizens and their families will benefit 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients in the first phase.
Patients will be provided with monthly support of over two-thirds of the minimum wage, as well as regular psychosocial support.
The Ministry will also pay additional payments to tuberculosis patients who are unable to afford their own medical care, who are bedridden or who are identified by the relevant health unit as needing improvement of their home living conditions.
Payments will be made through Social Assistance Cards, which will be provided through PTT.
Those who cannot go to the withdrawal centre for reasons of geography, illness, disability, etc. will be paid at the door.
The program is in many ways a first in the world.
One out of 10 firms to invest is still German
The head of the Turkish Investment Support and Promotion Agency of the Prime Minister's Office, Arda Ermut, said that the political tension between the two countries did not reflect on the business world.
Ermut said that "in the relations with Germany, there is not a single investor who says 'we have suffered because of this situation and we are fleeing' ".
Ermut said, "About 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies".
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
"The Germans are a significant part of our daily workflow", he said.
Ermut said that the partnership of Abraaj Group with logistics company Netlog is a good example of this.
Omar Syed, partner of Abraaj Group, pointed to the economic growth in Turkey, saying, "We have invested a total of 1 billion dollars in Turkey".
Özer is on his way to becoming the last Ottoman
It was reported that the experienced footballer, who was given two weeks by the management to find a club, has signed with Osmanlıspor, and will sign an official contract in the coming days.
At the beginning of last season, four hours before the end of the transfer, Özer Hurmacı signed a contract with the green-black club until 2019, and played 29 league, 2 cup matches, scoring 5 goals and 4 assists.
The management, which blocked Özer's return, agreed to replace him with the Brazilian Sergio Antonio yesterday.
The transfer of the century has taken place!
Barcelona announced that Neymar has been transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a fee of €222 million.
The transfer process, which has been followed with great enthusiasm by the football public, has been officially announced.
PSG added the Brazilian to the squad, paying the Catalan team 222 million euros, the player's release price.
Neymar became the most expensive transfer in football history with this bonus fee.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) of Ligue 1 have announced that they have signed a five-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar.
The club's website said that Neymar, 25, who was awarded €222 million for the cancellation of his services, has signed a contract with PSG until 30 June 2022.
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar said he was delighted to be wearing the France national team jersey, saying: "Since I started my football career in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most competitive and ambitious teams".
The reason I joined my teammates at this club is to win as many trophies as our fans want".
PSG will pay Neymar 45 million euros for each season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the French representative over 400 million euros.
The strike of the seamen is over with a raise
The agreement was not reached in the increase clause of the collective contract between İZDENİZ A.Ş. of İzmir Metropolitan Municipality and the Turkish Seafarers' Union (TDS) affiliated to Türk-İş.
The union members of Izdenis went on strike on July 12.
The strike, which lasted for almost a month, ended today at 3 p.m. after workers were given a raise.
According to the collective labor agreement signed, the salary of the land personnel of the IZDENIZ will be increased by 12 percent.
The rate of increase for personnel in the status of seaman, which increased by 25 percent, was 5 percent, along with the Income Tax exemption obtained after the renewal of the fleet by IzDENIZ, which was registered in the International Ship Register.
The General Directorate of the Navy announced that the flights in the inland Gulf will continue with the normal tariff, the flights in Yassıka from Tuesday, and the flights in Foça and Urla from the end of next week.
TDS President Hasan Pekdemir said that they have locked down transportation with their 23 days of strikes, and said: "The people of Izmir will be relieved".
As a result of the strike, improvements have been made in the rights of our workers on land and at sea.
We leave the table with pleasure.
The average sailor will get 28 percent and the average sailor 20 percent.
We had friends who worked at the minimum wage.
We've made some serious improvements in their pay.
Nostalgia is in the Niche with "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So for the characters' glory days in the '80s, the grunge era of the '90s (when minds like David Wain and Michael Showalter were doing the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for himself, the year 2001, before his stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went on to bigger things, this version of the story is nostalgic for all of them.
As a cultural product, it's both the embodiment and the embodying of our time with Facebook, the constant reminder.
But as a series, it's like it's expired.
"First Day of Camp" was an unexpected success, and not just because of its absurd humor (it contained a story about the origins of a talking box plant, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By concentrating on the main comedy (the middle-aged actors playing mature, mischievous children) he realized the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.
Now, "Ten Years Later", in which adults play adults, is less emotionally based and includes a more casual parody, including a monologue about a perverted follow-up to the '90s film "The Hand That Squeezed the Cradle".
At one point, the character is mixing an Apple Powerbook, some single-wheeled skateboards, and "a bunch of other stuff from 1991".
Most of the basic stories are the same.
Soft-hearted Coop is no longer a writer, still unable to forget Katie.
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.
And now there's another crazy treacherous plot, instigated by George H. W. Bush (a very well-placed imitation by Michael Ian Black) and involving Ronald Reagan (again Mr. Showalter).
As always, the best part of the series is the catchphrases.
Especially nice to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd with the under-bearded lip in Matt Dillon's "The Cattle", whose Andy, the most popular kid in his old school, now looks like an old man.
There might be random moments of insanity that power this series, like some kind of recurring "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I think is the logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where the final scene of it gets the crew of friends to go see the premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon is addressing a different kind of nostalgia: "The Americans" with its Cold War revival, the movie "Blonde Bomb", and even "GLOW" with its iconography of East versus West wrestling.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy, directed by Rhys Thomas, looks like found TV: a 1980s Romanian cop buddy drama about two Bucharest police officers fighting for the real, atheistic and Marxist-Leninist path.
The lead roles are played by Gregor the Wolf and the idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, with English dubbing of their dialogues by Channing Tatum (who is also the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a very brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There's some nice visual comedy.
And the famous cast of voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny, is a good fit for the "know who" game.
But "Comrade Detective" is so dedicated to the realisation of a clumsy propaganda drama that (including a killer wearing a Reagan mask) he often plays just like him.
He can't get through six long episodes and comedy isn't fast enough or frequent enough.
While Gregor and Iosef frequent the American embassy, where two fat men always eat a lot of hamburgers in the lobby like hungry wolves, "Comrade Detective" could do much better if it was shortened to a narrower length.
The message to the imaginary communist viewer is that Western culture can turn anything into mass-eating food.
The Romanian inventors were not wrong: we do this to our own recent past and even theirs.
The father of FETO, Kadyanli
The British government has seen through fifty years of experience our family's loyalty and sacrifice.
The highest offices of the government have acknowledged that this family has always been deeply committed to the British Government and has rendered great service.
The British Government must act wisely and carefully with this planting planted by its own hands, carefully researching and examining everything and making a careful decision.
When trying to understand FETO, the starting point is the organization of Hashashis, but one essential difference is forgotten, that FETO is an organization that emerged in the imperialist period and is operating with colonialist goals.
The first movement to be addressed in this minval is the Kadyanites, in my opinion.
In the English praise in the introduction, the person who describes himself as 'the seedling planted by the hands of the British Government' is the founder of Kadyanlilik, Mirza Ghulam Ahmed Kadyanli.
Ghulam Ahmed, born in Kadyan, a small town in the Indian state of Punjab, reported that on December 1, 1888, Allah ordered him to take the biat from his followers and establish a separate congregation.
Ghulam Ahmed went a little further and said that in 1891, according to the revelation and inspiration he received, Jesus died a natural death like the other prophets, and that Allah sent him as the Messiah and Mahdi that Christians and Muslims were waiting for.
According to this, the Messiah that Muslims are waiting for is the same person as the Mahdi, which is Mirza Ghulam Ahmed Kadyani.
(Islamic Encyclopedia, TDV) What is the meaning of the word "Islam"?
Ghulam Ahmed, who wrote books defending persecuted Muslims against Hindus and Christians in India, which came under complete British rule after the 1857 Sipahi uprising, recalls the portrait of Gülen, who defended Islam against secularism with the presidency of the Anti-Communist Society in Erzurum, which was supposedly founded entirely by sainthood-minded Saiks but later emerged with CIA support.
Like Gülen, Ghulam Ahmed's idea, which is most loved by imperialists, is that "jihad" is a Muslim's struggle with his own self, and if you can live your religion freely, there is no dimension to imperialism to fight.
Remember, Gülen went a step further and praised the Crusader attacks, even though the wounds on our history are still visible, in a 'sermon' last year: "It's not too dangerous for the Crusader to invade your country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
Once they don't touch your wife, your daughter.
They don't touch the temple, they don't touch the Crusaders!
Apart from the similarity of the theses with FETO, the idea that the Mahdi and the Messiah were united in himself, the idea that his community would be the savior of Islam, the concept of jihad meant only self-defence, the spread of Kadyanism took place in the field of education and civil society in general.
The total number of Kadyanis' centers in the world, which is said to have more than 2 million 'medical personnel', is 1869, and the number of countries where the emergency aid organization "Humanity First" is officially registered is 23.
The data also includes 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, 8 Kadyan printers in Africa alone, 505 educational institutions in 11 countries, and nearly 16,000 mosques around the world.
If we consider that Professor Abdusslam, the "first Muslim scientist" to win the Nobel Prize, Sir Zaferullah Khan, who became the President of the United Nations Court of Justice, and Mahershala Ali, the "first Muslim actor to win an Oscar", are also Kadyanites, we can see more clearly the depth of global power's approval of the Kadyanites.
Let's note that the Kadyan meeting last week with 30,000 people in England was also polished as a show of force.
A brief look at their history is enough to understand that the Kadyanis, whose slogan is "Love everyone, hate no one", actually meant "love your occupiers/colonists".
The origin and motivation of structures like Hulasa, FETO or Tahir-ul-Qadr can be traced back to the Kadyanis, and all these organizations are actually supported as a means to corrupt societies in order to give a passage to imperialism and serve colonialism.
"Last wish" came out of the cargo.
Emily Pomeranz, 50, who spent her final days in a Washington hospital with pancreatic cancer, longed for a chocolate milkshake at a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of the woman's contacted the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has been running the same restaurant for 47 years, put the drink on dry ice and sent it by "fast delivery" cargo to a hospital 600 kilometers away, paying the fee of 123 dollars.
Two new projects from Ahmed Kul
Ahmet Kul İnşaat, which has implemented important projects such as Lavinya Park, Autoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, has put Dia Mare in Istanbul Mimaroba, and Solse 7 in Bodrum Yalıkavak for sale.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project, developed by architect Çamoğlu Architecture, was developed to get the maximum benefit from the sea.
Dia Mare, which is located on an area of 11,000 square meters, has a total of 188 residential and 17 commercial units.
The roughly completed project will begin delivery to its new owners in March 2018.
Dia Mare has a large number of apartment types, ranging from 2+1 to 5+1.
The company will start two new projects in Mimaroba and Bitez this year, and in 2018 it is preparing to sign two large projects in Topkapı.
He transferred 753 million to affiliates.
Barış Yıldız said that many programs are being carried out outside the TRT, where 6,760 personnel work, and that they are paid at hefty prices.
The CHP deputy in TRT 2016 again turned the nation's taxes over to AKP companies".
He said, "It's called robbery".
The source that TRT passed on to its affiliated manufacturing companies was revealed by the data obtained from official documents.
The official response to the application of the CHP Istanbul MP Barış Yarkadaş under the Law on Information Acquisition showed how TRT's resources are spent.
Yarkdaş said that despite all technical possibilities, in 2016 753 million 500 thousand TL were transferred to subsidiary companies through programmes under the name of external construction.
The CHP deputy used the phrase "The meaning of this is clear".
"The production companies of AKP journalists and businessmen are looting TRT".
"Millions are paid to unseen or undetected productions", he said.
Yarkdaş recalled that the money transferred to the companies was collected from the people's taxes, "the institution with 7 thousand staff has become the barley of the AKP".
"What programs did these companies sign up for that 7,000 people couldn't do, and they got the money?"
Yarkdaş said that the advertising revenue of TRT in 2016 was 224.456.182 TL, adding that when the salaries of staff and other expenses are taken into account, the advertising revenue remains as ear in the camel.
Friend, "TRT, which has become the voice of AKP, does not get advertising because it is not followed".
The food journalists are getting paid by TRT, they are making a fuss for the AKP.
"The people are carrying the burden", he said.
Yarkdaş from CHP continued: "TRT pays staff 660 million TL a year; but all the work is done by outside production".
753.5 trillion dollars were withdrawn from the TRT, the people's pockets.
This is a disgrace.
He stopped killing himself and knelt down in front of his wife and apologized
The incident occurred at a parking lot in the neighborhood of Eyüpoğlu.
According to the information received, the residents of the area saw the citizen hanging down from the 4th floor of the parking lot and reported the situation to the fire and medical teams.
Firefighters were on the scene, and medical personnel were waiting.
After nearly an hour of persuasion by psychologists and police teams called to the scene, Yunus G., a 34-year-old father of three, apologized by kneeling in front of his wife, who was watching him in tears.
On the other hand, on the street where Yunus G. was attempting suicide, about 100 people were sitting on the sidewalks watching the situation, while some citizens recorded with their mobile phones.
Friday messages will serve as a reminder to friends and relatives!
What time is Friday prayer?
Friday messages are still being searched for by citizens who will benefit from the day's fee to send to relatives and friends.
On this day, when the citizens who will perform their prayers direct the question of what time the Friday prayer will be, the mosques will be opened to the hands of the creator.
Here are the details of the Friday messages and the time of the Friday prayer, which are being studied on this special day of great importance for our religion.
Ask forgiveness for your sins. No sin is greater than God's mercy.
Good Friday.
Allah my peace and blessings be upon him.
You don't disappoint the hopeful.
You can't refuse anything you ask of Sen.
O Deva, give spiritual healing to your servants, whose capital is hope and whose weapon is prayer.

My Lord, let my servant say, "I am pleased with You".

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will not change soon, after it has reduced speculation that slow economic growth and a rise in volatile inflation will be a factor.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to be "slow" as it kept interest rates steady as family incomes shrank.
Decision-makers on the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, thus calling for a smaller increase this month after slow economic growth weakened support for growth.
The bank lowered its growth forecasts in its quarterly inflation report to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that household incomes would continue to shrink as inflation was expected to rise to close to 3% in the spring.
However, he signaled that interest rate hikes would be necessary in the next few years to curb inflation fuelled by Brexit, and said borrowing costs could remain higher than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the massive post-Brexit economic recovery package launched a year ago.
The bank said it would end its Periodic Funding Plan, which provides cheap financing to banks, from next February but expects to provide a further £15 billion (£115 billion in total) under the plan.
Minutes after the interest rate decision was made, the bank said: "In the central estimate of the MPC, the non-gross domestic product (GDP) is slowing in the short term with the contraction of household real incomes continuing to be a burden on consumption".
On interest rates, he stressed that "some tightening in monetary policy" might be necessary to ease inflation and that the market would be "a bit higher" than expected.
Markets are still predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stresses that any increase will be "gradual" and "limited".
According to the May forecast, the bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintains its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound has lost value against the dollar and the euro since the news.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change came after the disappointing recent growth figures, which were 0.2% in the previous three months compared to 0.3% in the second quarter, softened expectations of a multiplication of growth.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but will start to show a slight increase towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
While the bank says the contraction will get worse before it recovers, the latest inflation report leaves households hit by rising inflation and paltry wage increases with little to rejoice over.
The bank said monetary policy would "not prevent" the revenue hit over the next few years, but expected wages to improve "significantly" by the end of its three-year forecast.
The rising demand for British goods as a result of the weak pound will support the economy by offsetting some of the declining consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the shock that drove the pound upside down, after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the EU referendum vote.
The bank estimates it will probably take four years for the full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank's latest interest rate decision, there was a growing inflationary pressure on hard-to-reach households and three policymakers demanding an interest rate increase that rose to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the rise was "completely" related to the weak pound against their 2% target.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent declines in interest rates, the mortgage market will once again become more competitive as lenders demand to get the job done and close the year in a positive way.
The market is looking good in re-mortgages, especially for those nearing the end of their existing contracts, with many free options and low interest rates becoming more popular than ever".
NHS will prescribe controversial HIV medication to 10,000 people
After a battle in the High Court over the funding of the drug in the NHS, patients will be able to access 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex, will be provided by health services to approximately 10,000 people through a three-year pre-trial, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by around 86 per cent in high-risk individuals.
The Supreme Court's decision last year agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the decision, saying the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite local authorities' claims to fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed as a "new and serious intervention" by Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "turning point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be public first-choice clinics, with more clinics joining in October and fully implemented across the UK by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a series of HIV medications that reduce the risk of contracting HIV before sex.
Trials have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that a person has enough of the drugs in his body to prevent HIV from settling in.
These drugs can be taken every day or up to two hours before sex.
Those eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify suitable participants from men, women, transgender individuals, and those whose partners' HIV status is unknown to be controlled by an antiretroviral therapy.
People living in the UK and registered with a practitioner will also be able to register for potential participation in participating local sexual health clinics.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England has signed an agreement to supply the drugs this week in an international tender.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, implemented and implemented at large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This new and serious intervention will contribute to the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in thirty years of progress toward solving one of mankind's major health problems.'
Deborah Gold, president of the National Aids Trust, said: 'This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is properly targeted at those who need it and those at risk, it has the potential to turn the HIV epidemic in the UK around.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to a new and powerful tool, which is truly personalized and non-negotiable with a spouse, through this trial funded by the NHS in the UK, which will lead to the healing of many lives.
We are warmly welcoming this message.'
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority now is to ensure that the trial is rapidly rolled out nationwide and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
With the experimental drug PrEP now available, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV".
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'We welcome the start of the PrEP trial, and it has been delayed by months of delays and then government backlash.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the spread of this life-changing infection.
The trial will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it's important that this trial is rolled out nationwide as quickly as possible to protect those exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in our communities.

Two secrets of death
Ummit Makbule Çilingiroğlu (51), daughter of former Industry and Trade Minister Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, who was born in Washington, fell to her death from the 19th floor of a business center in Istanbul Levent, which also served as a hotel.
Melis Salihoğlu, a 24-year-old student of Koç University, was also found dead in his home.
It was alleged that Salih's son hanged himself.
An investigation has been launched into two mysterious deaths that were ruled by police as suicides.
'He was still depressed'
Ummit Makbule Çilingiroğlu, daughter of Turkey's first Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, who served in the 1971 Nihat Erim government, was born in 1966 in Washington, and entered the Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler on August 1 at 17:00.
A Kuwaiti tourist who had settled in the 19th floor room and could not be heard from for a while, saw the lifeless body of Chilingiroğlu and informed the hotel management, an ambulance and police were called to the scene.
The medical team determined that Çilingiroğlu lost his life after falling from the 19th floor.
The mother, Mediha Çilingiroğlu, who testified to the police, said, "He was depressed lately".
He arrived in Istanbul from Ankara on July 31.
I have a granddaughter with leukemia from my other daughter.
"He was caring for my grandson and was negatively affected by my grandson's illness", she said.
The funeral of Çilingiroğlu, whose body was taken to the Forensic Medical Institution, is expected to be held in Ankara.
We're investigating whether Chilingiroğlu was thrown by someone or committed suicide.
The "dead" claim
The other suspected death in Istanbul was in Sarıyer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Salihoğlu (24) was found dead in his home.
The alleged father of the girl went to the house of his daughter near the school, where he was not heard from and could not reach him on his cell phone.
The father found his daughter's dead body at home.
It was claimed that Melis, who was loved by her family, close circle and friends, committed suicide by hanging herself at her home.
Melis Salihoğlu's death has devastated his family and loved ones.
A friend of Melis' followed on social media, "A bright, bright sun was hitting us in the face".
We were having fun with the green grass under our feet, your best friend Jack and your sister Eisan, chasing after that little plastic ball.
He shared the message "What need now to die".
Living in luxury: The hanging floors and clever design tricks have turned this tiny Earls Courts apartment into a luxurious home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate renovation, went into modest business in 2014 by moving from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court.
It's on the first floor of a spectacular Queen Anne style terrace and is a testament to the new design that convinced Joanne to pack her bags.
"I used to live in a much larger area in Knightsbridge with my ex-boyfriend", says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be worth my price.
I was shown the apartment at Earl Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with him and I proposed that day".
After the initial visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment was renovated from top to bottom.
Originally a one-room property with a complex layout, you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom, and Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a hanging floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, and lots of light.
That was my condition".
To this end, Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed hired Erfan Azadi to take advantage of the 12.5 ft ceiling and create not only a structure but also a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't high enough to add two spaces on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a hanging floor you could stand in.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steel skeleton is quite complex", he explains.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they could be piled up without having to bend down on top of each other.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but the steel would be tilted so that it would be at the right height for the function above or below".
This arrangement brought in many additional dramas, allowing Erfan to get two full-size rooms on top of each other.
The old-style light copper window, taken from Retrouvius for the hanging, looks out onto the magnificent living space below.
The mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and old-fashioned Serge Mouille lighting all define the style of the design.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding space, space and light.
Mirrors placed at either end of the short corridor make it appear taller.
The mirrored protective panel in the kitchen gives the feeling of a window opening onto another room.
Mirror units in the attic provide storage space for Joanne's entire forklift kit and her slingshot.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more magnificent sense of space, is that it can close the kitchen when it's not in use.
Kitchens are not new.
What's original about this is that it's a garage-style, up-lifting door.
"We used some engineering on this", explains Erfan, who built the steel-reinforced polished MDF door.
"It's got a balance weight so when you push the door up, it slides really easily".
With the clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16 square feet, an extra bedroom, and an improved living plan.
"At the end of the day, it's what you sell the living space for, or the value of your property", says Erfan.
"Ideally, a realtor will come in and do a calculation based on the seating area".
They've managed to use quality materials to give the space a luxurious look while increasing the floor space.
"Materials are the things you touch, and so they help you to form an emotional bond in the home", says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the power lines in the walls at home.
These are important, but they don't shake the strings of your heart".
This is proof that with good design and increased square footage, an apartment can go from being a standard thing to something quite spectacular.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens with its bonservice in Beşiktaş
After a month and a half of negotiations, he was transferred to Beşiktaş with the Lens bonservice, which was initially considered as a rental.
After intense negotiations over the past week, Lens has signed a deal with the Black and White team for 5 million euros in bonuses.
It was revealed that the Dutch player, who signed a five-year contract, will receive 2.2 million euros per year.
Beşiktaş is expected to make an official announcement regarding the transfer of Jeremain Lens.
Wedding photos of famous couples
After living in a relationship for almost 4 years, model Çağla Şikel and actor and singer Emre Altuğ entered the world house in Sortie.
The couple immortalized their wedding ceremony with a photograph they called "the most special moment of our lives".
The couple decided to separate after 7 years.
The brothers are fighting over a $500 million real estate empire.
Two brothers, forty years after the dynasty founded by Italian families, are at war over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in Toorak, three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has filed himself with the High Court over how to allocate property and business assets.
Paul had wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the dismantling was still hotly debated in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since a shop they bought in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contractor sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
As part of an agreement with his late father, Colin (described by Paul as "an important driving force and dominant personality in the De Lutis family") owns two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns a third.
A court filing says that means Colin has assets worth $316 million and Paul has assets worth $176 million.
For Paul, the division of property and cash is a contentious issue.
In his first affidavit to the court in 2015, he wrote: "The divisions proposed by Colin left him with properties that I always described as the best".
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also in a fight over who will control the current business, with Paul claiming Colin has left him out of the business.
Colin argues that's not true, but he accuses Paul of mismanaging some properties.
Colin, in a sworn statement he made earlier, says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots dictate that family is the first priority".
The costs of the case are rising with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and top lawyers such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior legal advisers hired by both sides, recorded by firms including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were an Italian immigrant family who had operated grocery stores and singing shops since the late 1950s and had bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They pawned their property to buy the Collingwood estate where Colin opened the family's first sweatpants store.
Colin says he started Westco there "in my last years in high school, when Paul was a little boy (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hope to leave their property to their sons in a friendly way.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted brothers to go to court", he wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colin said Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he quit.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark "were unhappy with the terms of their financial separation".
According to a 2015 biography of television star best friend Eddie McGuire, Colin tried to avoid attention despite being a former AFL club board member.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin texted back, "I can't say anything more", because the case was in court.
"It has been very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and take our family's name to court", she wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he was trying to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to fall into the current dispute", he said, adding that he was "still hopeful about the solution".
On Friday, that hope seems to have vanished.
Colin wrote, "Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future".
Trump's new personal pen is planning to curb the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
If so, he's the first.
Politico reports that the new White House private column will restrict the flow of information (including news media reports) to President Trump in the hope of keeping the boss more stable.
A little bit of information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"On his first day in office, the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, summarized a key problem President Donald Trump plans to solve with the White House: the ability of bad information to get into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the staff that information should flow through the president, whether it's on paper or in briefings, because the president can make better decisions when he's given the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis makes a lot of sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by controlling the media diet and failed.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and he's in the White House, and his TV-watching habits are still good.
A former campaign adviser, Sam Nunberg, told Politico in February, "If Aday Trump was upset that he didn't have a fair place in the media, it was productivity-enhancing to show him that he had a fair place in a convincing media establishment".
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time, "The key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit in check, according to six campaign officials, was to ensure that personal media consumption included a steady stream of praise".
I'm all right.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any given time is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaigners know something the rest of us don't, like that Trump's tweets would be far more provocative if they didn't intervene.
We'll probably never know about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his men were able to get him out of harm's way even a few times, then it was worth the effort.
But no one could stop Trump from creating a constant controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of competing factions, people who were trying to advance their own agenda in every case with the material they presented to Trump (which could be credible or unreliable) and who were putting forward their own worldview.
Politico reported in May that throughout this story, advisers strategically tended to pass on questionable information to the president.
Here's an example, detailed by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump has reacted angrily to negative news reports from the press, especially the leaks that have had a bad impact, and has devoted himself to finding out where they originated.
This happened in late February when someone misrepresented to the president a printed copy of an article from the website of internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, GotNews.com, accusing his private secretary Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a series of leaks" at the White House.
It didn't matter that Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he didn't provide any concrete evidence or that he made false accusations in the past and turned them down.
Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh".
Goldmacher added that then-Public Affairs Secretary Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter were "trying to put in place a system that would manage and document the documents that Trump received".
What was the result?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
Maybe he'll emerge as a more effective executive than Priebus, but Trump is still on his own impulse and his aides are still vying for influence.
These constant factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Crypto FETÖs have been revealed with a special template
The prosecutor of the Republic of Izmir, Berkant Karakaya, completed the investigation into the leakage of information and irregularities in the "military espionage investigation" after the secret witness code "Sarmaşek" told the Chief of Staff of the Naval Forces Command that the All-Admiral Jihad Yaycı was a FETÖ member.
The investigation highlighted that although the Admiral Yaycı was not a member of the organization, he helped the investigating authority in decrypting the members of the crypto organization in the Naval Forces Command and played an active role in the fight against FETO.
The decision, which noted that Yaycı's coup attempt on July 15 was attempted to be pacified by order of the Naval Forces Command, according to the so-called strict management order, highlighted that Yaycı had been actively fighting FETO since the first day of the coup attempt.
The following statements were used in the decision of non-compliance issued by Karakaya: "It is understood that Yaycı worked on the identification of personnel of the Naval Command in crypto, thanks to a special template for the identification of FETO members belonging to the class of crypto-security services and a special system created on the basis of 64 basic criteria and 209 sub-criteria".
It was decided that the prosecutor general cannot assess a presumptive assessment of the publisher, who is known to be an active anti-terrorist organization and has made great contributions in this direction, as a result of the struggle that was observed in the judicial investigations, a special and stubborn zeal, there was no evidence of the secret witness except for a statement that was not based on a foundation.
Admiral Broadcaster has been tried for insult before.
And it turns out that the FETO was behind it, and that the alleged crime was a conspiracy.
Former Air Pilot Colonel Hakan Dinç, who was in the complaint that the publisher insulted him, turned the complaint into a document in the form of an information note.
Tanker Base Commander Air Pilot Tuggeneral Bekir Ercan Van, former General Staff Headquarters Advisory Adviser Albay Muharrem Köse, who authorized the investigation, former General Staff Headquarters Intelligence Headquarters Corgeneral Mustafa Özsoy, former Judge Major Erkan Ağın, former Navy Captain Necmettin Aksoy, who authorized the prosecution, former Judge Captain Akif Us and former Judge Lieutenant Serdar Chamichi and former Judge Sergeant Akif Akif who testified against the publisher in the statement, were expelled from the TSK due to their links with FETO.
It emerged that some members of the organization, including FETO fugitive Tuncay Opchin, targeted Yaycı with their posts on social media before and after the coup attempt on July 15.
The travelers crossed the ditch, returned to the 'rich neighborhood'
Some of the richest landlords in the West Midlands are once again in a fight with determined travellers who have crossed the ditch dug by the council to reclaim the area outside their mansions.
The travelers parked their 20 caravans outside Solihull's fashionable street, known as the 'rich man's quarter'.
They returned after being fired in May, with horses, babies and a load of freight cars, tirelessly from the ditch the council had dug to cut their streams.
The group, acting with ingenuity, found a gap in the defense, and infiltrated their vehicles by setting a path through an unbarricaded section.
Angry residents have sharply criticized Solihull Council, saying it is "useless in solving the problem".
A resident, who did not want to be named, said: "They arrived on Monday evening after being dispatched from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.
The council should be ashamed of its actions because they are useless in solving the problem.
The Travelers were there in May, they were sent off, and now they're back again.
More came in last night, probably more today".
He added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with the long-standing removal decisions taken to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street and I'm not happy to keep paying my taxes when the council can't even stop it.'
One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'Just as a joke, we saw the last group of travelers just leaving, and we were immediately devastated by a new group.
This time, the numbers had increased, and a horse was seen grazing in the parking lot.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised camp on the Streetsbrook Street site, and are initiating the necessary legal proceedings to remove them from there as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it's vital that as many residents as possible call 101 and report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help to bring out the picture for the court to consider when we present our case.'
Galatasaray has listed Ndiaye on the stock exchange
According to the announcement sent to Borsa Istanbul by Galatasaray Sports Examination and Commercial Investments, the club will pay Osmanlıspor 7 million 500 thousand euros for the bonus service cost of the footballer, if he plays a total of 25 matches in the league, cup and Europe, 750 thousand euros, if he plays 50 more matches, 750 thousand euros.
Galatasaray will pay Ndiaye, who signed a four-year contract, a total of 11 million euros in guaranteed fees, amounting to 2 million 750 thousand euros for each year.
In addition, Ndiaye will receive a bonus of €5,000 for each point earned by the yellow-and-red team in matches played in the TFF Super League and UEFA competitions.
The statement also stated that the player has the right to unilaterally terminate the contract for 18 million euros from 15 June 2019.
Last day of the emergency!
They're rushing to the fire stations.
Thousands of vehicles were damaged by the storm and hailstorm that hit Istanbul on Thursday.
While many of the drivers who had reported the fire to insurance companies for damages were filing their reports, those who had not reported them to date also queued for reports.
Drivers who were wearing helmets and did not report today came to the fire stations to request a report because it was the last day of the period of notification.
Today is the last day
The drivers first took photographs of their vehicles to the firefighters to determine the damage to their vehicles.
Drivers whose vehicles were damaged later reported the damage to the authorities.
Hasan Erol, who came to the fire station to report, said, "I've made a recording, I'll take a picture".
It was crowded when I got here.
"There was damage to the windshield", he said.
"We came to run".
We're on the line.
We took the picture.
He said, "Now we wait for the report".
Sky towers with walls between sea and land are breathless
CHP MP Nadir Ataman, warning of the earthquake caused by the huge structures that rise on the coast, said: "The expert report in the case clearly says that these structures will not withstand a magnitude 6 earthquake".
It is stated that the stakes are not dug so deep, where the solid rock is 25-30 meters below.
Istanbul Ataköy beach is surrounded by high-rise hotels and residences that create a wall between sea and land.
The CHP's Member of the Bakırköy Municipality Council, Nadir Ataman, reacted to the giant high-rise buildings, hotels and residences that are rising one after another in the district.
Ataman noted that the buildings on the coast prevented the wind, "80 years ago, those who planned according to the wind had created the Atatürk Forest in Florida.
80 years later, they've reached the point where they've gotten a sense of urbanism, where they've built giant skyscrapers in wind tunnels and changed the climate.
"He's not breathing in the gut", she said.
Ataman said that the buildings that rise like walls on the shore of Ataköy change the climate balance: "The temperature is 10 degrees higher because of the skyscrapers".
These buildings need to be built in the direction of the wind.
But our skyscrapers are rising above the wind corridors of Istanbul.
The wind can't get through the county.
These structures are disrupting the natural balance of life.
Ataman said that the skyscrapers, which harm the environment and human health, cut off the connection of the people of Bakırköy with the sea, and that they would appeal to the Board of Monuments and go to court.
He can be treated without surgery.
The success rate of phenol therapy is 83%.
In this method, diseased tissue is effectively cleaned and the tissue cavity is filled with an agent that kills hair roots.
Another non-surgical hair-repair technique is the laser method.
With various lasers, the hair roots and surrounding tissue are burned by circularly scattered rays, which cause the tissue to become glued together.
These two non-surgical ways of treating spinal stenosis allow patients to return to social and work life in less time.
Dr. Mert Atak, who said that excessive weight, sedentary lifestyle, sitting for long periods, heavy hair and body hair and failure to follow hygiene rules cause hair loss, said that among the symptoms of the disease are disorders such as pain, infection, abscess and swelling in the tailbone.
Italy toughened the approach of NGOs to migrant rescue boats
Italy warned that NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean would not be allowed to continue unless they comply with the new rules affecting their operations.
Interior Minister Marco Minniti told the Torino newspaper La Stampa in an interview that "if the NGOs do not comply with the new charter, it will be difficult to see them continue to operate".
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat operated by the German aid organization Jugend Rettet, suspecting its crew of actively collaborating with human traffickers to facilitate illegal migration.
The charity, which has been active for just one year, has refused to comment on the content of the detailed charges brought against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
In a statement on social media, the organization said: "Saving human life is our top priority and will remain so, so we are very sorry that we cannot work in the search and rescue area at this time".
"We can only assess the allegations that are being made now after we have gathered all the information and been able to assess the situation".
Italian authorities have been tracking Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
The crew is suspected of taking the migrant boat full of rubber boats delivered directly to them by human traffickers and allowing the smugglers to escape in the boats for reuse.
According to the prosecutor's files, which were published by the Italian media, at least one such encounter allegedly took place within 1.3 miles of the Libyan coast.
The crew is suspected of disregarding the authority of the Italian coast guard, which oversees the rescue operations in the area, due to more than just humanitarian efforts.
The regulations required that boats like the Iuventa had an Italian police officer on deck who openly oversaw their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the charter: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latest said on Tuesday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they would not cause any "serious change or hindrance" to its own rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the rescues in recent weeks was a sign that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal security and cooperation with local governors were bearing fruit.
"We've started to see the light at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
This month, he announced plans to hold more talks with Libyan governors on economic development initiatives and measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving Chad, Niger and Mali in the hope of reaching Europe.
The last minute punch!
As is the case every year, watermelon-flavored vodka was served at the "Day of the Parachute Troops" celebrations in Moscow, the capital of Russia.
The Russian NTV, which was broadcasting live in a Russian Gorki Park, which was too drunk to attend the event, attacked Nikita Razvozjayev, a correspondent for the Russian television.
The reporter who was reporting the day's events on live television warned the man who suddenly appeared and cursed, "We're going to take over Ukraine". "Please shut up", he said.
The drunken man, identified as the former paratrooper, threw a hard punch at the reporter's warning.
The reporter, stunned by the punch, tried to get away from the man.
The shock was seen live by millions.
The Economic Coordination Council has been convened
The Economic Coordination Council (ECC) was chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek.
The first meeting of the EKK, which was held under the leadership of Shimsek after the cabinet change, began at 18.30 in Çankaya Köşkü.
The meeting will discuss Turkey's macroeconomic outlook.
The meeting was attended by Finance Minister Naji Agbal, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Labor and Social Security Jülide Sarıeroğlu, Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci, Minister of Development Lütfi Elvan, Treasury Minister Osman Çelik, President of the Central Bank Murat Çetinkaya and other bureaucrats.
You can get rid of your spine in 45 minutes.
Doç noted that only 5 percent of patients need surgery for treatment of spinal cord injury. "The first step is rest and medication", says Dr. Oguz Karaeminoğlu.
The group of patients with persistent pain should be tested with experimental methods (such as epidural injection, radiofrequency techniques, intra-disc procedures), and Karaeminoğlu warned that "if all these methods are not successful, if numbness and weakness in the legs are detected, then the surgery will become difficult".
Karaeminoğlu said that the 'totally closed spine surgery' that reduces the risk today also reduces the hesitation of patients who cannot get results with experimental methods, and that it is possible to get rid of spinal cord disease in 45 minutes:
Although microscopic surgery has been shown to produce relatively good results compared to open surgery, there may be some complications after surgery, such as spinal adhesions, recurrence of hernia, and later development of back pain and infection.
Microscopic surgery is often described as 'closed surgery', but microscopic surgery is also practiced in the same approach as open surgery.
In a closed-back surgery, these risks are eliminated because the surrounding tissues are protected.
The whole closed-back surgery only takes 45 minutes.
A special commission is in charge.
The commission will include CHP MPs Mehmet Gökdağ, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Peace Yarkadaş and Turan Aydoğan, a member of the High Discipline Council.
The Commission will meet with Berberoğlu on 4 October at the Istanbul 14.
He will also follow up his trial in the Criminal Court and appeals to the Constitutional Court and the District Court of Appeals.
In the assignment letter, which was signed by the General Secretary of the CHP Kamil Okyay Sındır and the Vice President Bülent Tezcan, "The independence and impartiality of the court, the fact that it does not take orders from anywhere other than the law, is an indispensable condition of justice".
"Our MP Enis Berberoğlu did not demand any special status while performing his parliamentary duties, did not take refuge in the inviolability armor recognized by his parliamentary office, wanted to protect his faith in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary", it was said.
It was suggested that the trial process was that the court preferred to implement political orders rather than judge.
The article argued that the decision to arrest the deputies was made without the verdict being decided, despite the Constitutional Court's decisions finding them wrong, which is a clear evidence that the court made the decision under influence.
Michelle Carter was fined for messages that encouraged Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months behind bars and five years of eligible parole.
Carter was convicted in June of the taxi-driven murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Mr. Roy's father spoke at Thursday's hearing, saying, "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend".
Carter has been released to open the appeals process.
Although he faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, his own legal team had argued that both he and Mr. Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter was punched with tearful eyes, his hands curled and his eyes staring down at the ground.
The prosecutor told the court, "His actions killed Conrad Roy".
He ended her life to heal his.
He didn't take responsibility".
"He showed no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible situation that he fully regretted".
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz said that he did not see "any significant influence on his actions by age, maturity, or even mental illness".
A prosecutor read a statement by Lynn Roy, Mr. Roy's mother: "Not a day goes by that I do not mourn the loss of my dear son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I've been able to get through it all, and I'm trying to be there for her sisters with all the pain we're going to carry forever".
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that the fact that her brother would never attend the wedding or that he would never be able to have children "has not gone out of his mind".
"The loss of the person you've been with every day since I was born is a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life".
Since there is no Massachusetts law that makes it a crime to tell someone to kill themselves, it looks like the case is going to be a riot.
Mr. Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 when Carter was 17.
The case attracted national attention when it was revealed that Carter's text messages encouraged her to end her own life.
While he was on vacation with his family, she sent several messages two weeks before his death, saying, "Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there's a lot of ways".
Moments before his suicide, he wrote, "You must do this, Conrad", and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy".
Judge Moniz, instructing that the press be not allowed to profit from this case, said that Carter was seeking attention through the death of Mr. Roy.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Among the minority who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a dissenting article in the Los Angeles Times that said: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail".
Mehmet Şimşek predicted a dramatic growth
In his statement, Shimsek stated that inflation in Turkey should fall to low single digits and expressed that food inflation constitutes a "risk area".
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts inflation will fall below 7 percent in 2018.
In his speech, Mr. Lightning said:
The next 12 months are critical to reducing uncertainty.
The biggest incentive is to reduce uncertainty.
There's a strong government.
There is no political uncertainty.
I hope the uncertainty in our nearby geography will diminish.
I believe that by increasing our resilience to shocks with some reforms, we can get Turkey on a growth trend above 5%.
I told you months ago.
The worst is behind us.
And gradually we're shifting our energy away from those areas, and toward inclusive growth, reforms that will increase employment.
So the next 12 months are critical.
Reform on the one hand, less uncertainty on the other, no political uncertainty.
Hopefully, we'll have luck, and the problems in our nearby geography will diminish.
Whether we like it or not, a lot of our classic markets are down.
Like Libya or Iraq.
We're not just losing markets, we're facing a wave of migration of over 3.5 million.
If we look at the last 15 years, Turkey has grown by 5.7 percent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, that is, we have solid problems.
Now, with some reforms, we will increase our resistance to shocks and some more removing the question marks in the minds of investors, and we will put Turkey back on the policy of growth above 5%.
Let me be clear, we have such a generous pension system here.
I think it's reasonable to say that our pension companies aren't doing enough.
Once you're in auto participation, the performance will be strong.
Why? Why?
Because we took precautions.
Companies don't have to go out and spend the effort.
We've been following these concerns, and we've been considering the poor performance, and we've been thinking about how we're going to allocate global assets to which areas of investment.
You know, the returns are high.
Once it's clear that the government's 25 percent will be in addition to the performance there.
Plus, the rest is in the Treasury notes, where the risk is usually low.
I think that when we look at the big picture, there's going to be a lot of interest in the next period.
Because they're gonna see the performance.
There's success in the other field, not failure.
We reorganized the BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, 70 billion pounds in savings.
The system has succeeded.
And the automatic subscription has 2.6 million subscribers, and I have 775 million lire in savings.
We're asking for a little more effort from the companies.
Let them do some advertising, explain the system.
We're working during the insurance period.
Maybe if we stretch it a little bit...
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe the citizens see the payoff, see the accumulation, and stay in the system.
Out of the system is 38 percent.
Almost half of those who leave are on voluntary individual pensions.
You don't want two individual retirement accounts.
What are you doing? What are you doing?
You're out of the car.
We were actually expecting a decline of around 10 percent.
That means we're very optimistic.
The system works once.
We brought a prime ceiling.
Insurance companies sometimes explain unilaterally.
They raised their premiums too fast.
When we asked why, they said the court's decisions were not taking into account the existing regulations.
We made a new clean layout.
We said, "Do what you have to do".
They said, "No, we'll wait for the judgment".
And we said, "That's not going to happen".
We have a disagreement here.
Of course, when this ceiling went into premium, some firms refused.
We made a new arrangement.
We've created a pool of risky insurers.
I'll say this, I'll say it again.
I prefer this system to work through competition.
I mean, I don't think these ceiling pricing practices are right, they forced us.
I'd like to see a three-dimensional view of this.
The system we've built should be taken into account.
Two, keep the system running, a price on that track.
Adding to that is a heavy burden, with almost 30-31 liras of every 100 lira premium paid going to the GST deductions.
I'm working right now, we're going to talk to our finance minister.
Third, technology is advancing rapidly.
Now, over time, traffic accidents will also be reduced dramatically, structurally.
But it's compulsory traffic insurance.
The morning cover saved his leg.
Buerger's disease, which begins in adolescence, was once a male disorder but is now common in women.
One of these women is Mehtap Dursun, 36.
The pain, which started two years ago, has become chronic in his soles.
The young woman, who had difficulty walking, was in danger of losing her leg and went from hospital to hospital.
A friend of his, Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko, recommended it.
The headline in the morning showed the news 'Saved the life of the Minister of Emergency Situations of Azerbaijan'.
It turned out that Dursun, who went to Kalko, was battling Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko has taken the young woman to the emergency room.
Dursun, who recovered from his pain shortly after, is now receiving oxygen therapy.
Audi to modify 850,000 diesel vehicles as carmakers face backlash
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades on more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of the BMW board of directors said that the firm believes there are "more smart options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's headquarters in Munich (where a ban or restriction on diesel vehicles is being considered).
Daimler said on Tuesday it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the firms identified these moves as recalls.
European car manufacturers had heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But the nitric oxide released by diesel engines is known to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment that automotive companies need to wear to neutralize the dirty smoke emitted by diesel vehicles is also rising, making it difficult for cars to remain competitive in price.
While German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has been accused of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring the root of the problem.
Firms are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which hides the use of a device known as a decoy and regulates emissions while a car is being tested, relaxing it under normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the US and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development division was arrested in Germany.
The former director, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and therefore not protected against extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, which expanded its United States-based investigation after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions regulations in Europe.
Audi's involvement in the investigation may be difficult for Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer has an excessive share in Volkswagen's profits.
Don't click on everything you see
The President of the Turkish Nöroşirürji Association, Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü Çağlar, warned against jumping fishing in shallow places that are not sure of the depth.
Every year, thousands of people face the risk of fracturing their neck and suffering spinal cord injuries from diving into shallow water.
Neck fractures most often develop in the 5th or 6th vertebrae.
The fracture is characteristic of the nerves that feed the muscles of the arms and legs as well as the respiratory muscles.
"In these types of accidents, the neck spinal region, which is our most valuable organ, is cut or compressed by the broken spine and becomes dysfunctional", said Prof. Dr. Çağlar.
"Injury to the spine is not only exacerbated by incorrect first aid, but can also lead to death", he said.
Diving is the fourth leading cause of spinal cord injury.
The average age of the injured is 20 to 29, and the majority are male.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "Fishing in water that cannot be seen should not be skipped".
"No matter how well you dive, you could get seriously injured".
Prof. Dr. Çağlar also recalled:
Depending on the level of spinal cord damage, the limbs may be paralyzed to varying degrees.
You may know how to swim, but water can be deceiving.
What seems deep to you may be shallow.
In the United States and Australia, warning signs along the coast have reduced the number of shallow-water fishing boats by 70 percent.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar said, "Although 28 years of coastline has been found in Turkey, unfortunately, not a single warning sign has been found outside Istanbul".
"In connection with these types of life-threatening accidents, it is necessary to have information lights or information boards on beaches and pools in a noticeable way every summer before the health directorate, schools and social awareness project".
Professor Kadir Kotil, Head of the Spinal and Peripheral Neurological Surgery Group of the TURK Neurosurgery Association, suggested that:
First thing you do is call 911.
The neck should be held as steady as possible, not moved, and be detected by a hard cap.
The airway should be provided and the patient should be placed on the backside to drain the water into the lungs.
It should not be held by the legs and swung to drain water.
The patient's neck should not be corrected.
The neck spine could be broken.
However, if the spine is not yet damaged, first aid and improper position of the neck during transportation can cause the fractured bone fragments to press against the spine and cut and damage it.
The Provence lavender is threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but there is a warning that it is under threat from climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which brings much less rain in the spring and mostly in the fall.
This affects the life of the lavender.
There is also a small leaf beetle, the August beetle, which is a pest that carries micro-bugs, and it is very abundant in very dry air".
And a lot of things are at stake.
As much as it attracts holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "We have smaller, less developed, or nonexistent, or weak buds, whereas we should have very tall buds with a few broad flowers.
So we have less essential oils".
Solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying a protective clay and water mixture on the plants and developing more resilient species to dry conditions.
The journalist's murder underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meets on Wednesdays to review the latest turmoil in Sinaloa state from organized crime, corrupt officials and plans to feature in the newspaper the endless drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedies, they gathered to discuss their safety.
They were told it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what makes them feel safer: bringing their children with them to the office that was the target of a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: adversaries, neutral, allies.
They want reporters to suggest names for each column, no evidence needed, just perceptions and insider voices.
Drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being paid by the government or the cartels, a list of Mexican chaos, the bad guy who makes newspaper writing dangerous.
There is no break in violence, while the number of bodies is increasing nationwide, and more of them are journalists: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 people have died since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and at least seven have died in seven states so far this year.
Among the latest deaths are writers' managers and inspirations, Riodoce's founding partner Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake was living in Mexico and being a journalist", Valdez writes in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is felt deeply but his presence is everywhere, with a large photograph of Valdez's middle finger hanging in front of Riodoce's building with the word "Justice" on it; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts that show his smile, his face with glasses and his signature Panama hat.
The interview takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters talk about their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was created in 2010 to handle the journalist cases, the Committee to Protect Journalists has prosecuted only two.
As with many of the thousands of murders per year linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they're still talking about the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken, even though the ground is more deceitful.
Without information on the killers, without justice, security interviews are of little use, says Ibarra.
"It's stupid to waste my time in this studio".
"You don't trust anyone until we know why".
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left his office in Riodoce, Culiacan, the state capital.
The red Toyota Corolla only made it a few blocks before it was stopped by two men, forced out of the vehicle and shot 12 times, presumably for the title of the newspaper that translates as The Twelfth River.
The gunman got into his car and drove away, and he hit the car nearby.
Valdez was 50.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
In Culiacan, gossip tends to circulate freely.
But there's almost nothing but silence about Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the U.S. in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival groups fight to fill the void.
Never mind the fact that one or many people are shot and killed on the streets every day in Sinaloa, or the cemetery is filled with the ornate, two-story mozoles of drug lords larger than many of the houses they live in.
For a minute, forget the "quiet" state where only one cartel controls the valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite being deeply aware of the dangers of Valdez's work, Riodoce's co-founder and CEO Ismail Bojorquez (60), was devastated by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the murder.
The first was an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival cartel groups that was at war with Guzman's sons, in a February broadcast.
This may have angered the sons, who were likely gang members who bought every copy of the print as soon as it was distributed to the newspaper vendors.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper with the same story was seized.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexican-based violence against journalists.
He'd lived so long, his friends and coworkers assumed he'd always be there.
He was a veteran reporter in the Northwest in 2013 when he joined five colleagues in the unveiling of Riodoce by selling them $50 worth of stock.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching on the topic of drugs", Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper gained a reputation for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish life-threatening research without fear of censorship, and readers were drawn to a publication where they could read stories that no one dared report.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage to continue pursuing the Mexican drug story no matter where it ended.
He admitted he was scared.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to go on living".
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life".
"You must accept your duty as a journalist, or you will play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?'"
The staff at Riodoce misses Valdez, the blasphemous joker, the friends who are generous with hugs and advice, the teachers who know how to survive...
They trusted his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He'd go to a bar called El Guayabo across the street from his office and he'd always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: has his love of routines collapsed?
His death forced them to question their assumptions about how best to do their jobs and survive.
"If you mess with their wives, their children, their clean jobs, their secret airstrip they use to transport drugs, they don't like it".
Bojorquez said, "These things were out of line".
The result was a high degree of self-sensing and self-protection, even at its best.
Trust your own instincts.
If you smell something, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, the director of Riodoce's writing, said, "The smell is a delusional sensation... and that's what happened to Javier".
He and others say the old rules don't apply in Sinaloa, just as they don't apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials...
The ground is constantly changing.
Suddenly, no cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce staff are meeting for security training, after it was revealed days ago that spyware sold only to governments had been used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers tried to escape the 40 degrees Fahrenheit (104 degrees Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to protect Riodoce's office, which is located in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-serious, half-serious, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were the 50 percent of the police that the governor himself said was unreliable.
It's been months since reporters have been in the mountainous countryside, effectively controlled by drug gangs.
In this week's issue, Riodoce explores three main stories.
The brother of former great boxer Julio Cesar Chavez was murdered in Sinaloa.
There was also the exposure of government spending concentrated in the governor's homeland.
And then there was a gang kidnapping at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant, a block from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official explanation as to who was kidnapped or how, so when it came time to write what everyone in the city knew, caution prevailed: The restaurant was a favorite of both drug traffickers and the authorities.
A reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated almost every level of politics for the past century.
Recently, many PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about events that happened earlier, including the escape of one of the sons of "El Chapo" Guzman during a military raid.
They'd only read it months ago, looking at Valdez's corner for the best source of information on the kidnapping.
Villareal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of its thin structure, said: "We already knew what was going on at first".
"At this time, all communication channels with our sources are cut off".
As staff turn into something they never expected, activists for the press, Valdez's office is being re-purposed as a warehouse for banners and clippings protesting the murders of journalists.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few banners and went to the local prosecutor's office for another reporter's demonstration the next morning.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was found, and DNA tests show that officials say it's him.
Journalists across the country have been expressing their views more loudly in organized protests, writing "Help the Boss" on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., trying to get international support for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that day, he asked to be assigned to something other than government news, feeling that his anger was interfering with his neutrality.
Valdez has consistently said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit officials and a careless society.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism", he wrote that journalists are being killed not only by drug gangs but also by politicians and security forces who collaborate with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 has linked more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and government officials.
Ramirez said, "You'll die in Mexico because they want to silence you".
The murders clearly had a cold shower effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
His body was found with a note said to be signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my news".
A computer keyboard and headset, serial next to his severed head.
In the northern border state of Chihuahua, some publications, such as El Norte, opted to shut down after the murder of reporter Miroslava Breach in March.
After their managers were killed in 2004, others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels with the headline on its front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states, even the country.
It's a tough call.
In exile, it's hard to find work and they're still searching the streets for danger.
And sometimes they're captured, as it were, from photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in a Mexico City apartment in 2015 along with four other women, three months after he fled Veracruz.
It's a daily dance with these high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and keep working.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says reporting on the drug trade terrified him.
He said, "Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter".
At midnight on a recent Saturday, as preparations were being made for the final issue, the Riodoce bureau chief sat on the sidewalk outside his office drinking beer, and at the same time the phones began ringing.
A series of armed clashes involving rival gangs and security forces near a coastal resort of Mazatlan have resulted in 19 confirmed deaths.
As promised in a series of cartel messages found around, the war continued to flare.
They put the news on Riodoce's website via their cell phones on the platform.
The front page was supposed to be changed the next day.
Sirens are ringing nearby, there's another gunfight in the vicinity.
Bojorquez quickly checked the police officers on duty to see if they were alert.
Even if they were afraid, they wouldn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the founder of his newspaper, his middle finger was displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, Riodoce's staff following in his footsteps.
"How can you think of shutting down", Bojorquez said, "when on the day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him out to do the news on the street?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid its enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, but it's a terrible one.
Researchers now say that the first finds of an incredible creature the size of a rhinoceros, discovered by a Canadian miner, are so well preserved that experts have identified it as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It was so well preserved that they could tell the stamp was reddish brown and could say it had a 'problematic past'.
A report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best preserved armored dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur breeds in the world.'
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived from the middle of the Cretaceous period, 110 million to 112 million years ago.
Its remarkably well-preserved condition has baffled researchers who describe it as 'truly marvelous.'
The herbivore armored beetle is the best-preserved fossil of its kind, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, while digging the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that looked strange from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years extracting the wild animal from a 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) pile of soil.
After all this intense work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
"If you close your eyes a little bit, you can even believe that it's almost asleep", says lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display.
'It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur species, the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
Researchers examined its skin and found that although it was covered in armor and looked like a walking tank, this herbivore was likely facing a serious threat from flesh-eating dinosaurs.
Heavily armoured, the dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
Experts suggest that it was hunted by larger dinosaurs, which allowed it to better blend into its environment and outrun its enemies.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the family of nodosaurs first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Now that the researchers had finished their work, they named the wild animal Borealopelta markmitchelli in honour of Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of the team that spent over 7,000 painstaking hours to uncover it.
The remarkable preservation of the species has enabled Dr. Mitchell and his international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the seals and the armor on the body.
They discovered counter-shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means the upper part of the creature is darker on the underside.
Although counter-shading is common, the findings are surprising because the size of the Borealopelta far exceeds that of any of the counter-shading animals alive today.
This means that the dinosaur has been hunted enough by the meat-eating dinosaurs to prefer hiding to facing evolution as a method of survival.
But the most modern animals that use counter-shading -- such as deer, zebras, or armadillos -- are much smaller and much more prone to being prey, which means that this nodosaur faced a serious challenge in surviving.
'The intense hunting of a giant, heavily armored animal shows just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous can be,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in their fur also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about its life, including preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate at its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept into the sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean surface.
Alberta was as warm then as South Florida is today, and probably the rivers and oceans were spread farther inland than they are now.
"The nodosor is completely covered in pulp and preserved, and it's also remarkable that the original shape of the animal has been preserved in 3D", Brown said.
'The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need much imagination to rebuild it; if you close your eyes a little, you can even believe it's almost asleep.'
The Cretaceous was the time when the giant theropods, the fleshy dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, which may have been hunted by a host of formidable ancestors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, a monster that was 38 ft (11.5 m) long and weighed 6 tons.
Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that after the Borealopelta died, they were swept out to sea and mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, while digging the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
This is the best preserved armored dinosaur, including skin and armor, according to the museum, and it's complete from nose to thigh.
The creature averages around 18 ft. (five meters) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two horns, 20 inches long, protruding from their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this armored weed wandered in the rough patches of what is now Western Canada until it was swept out to sea by a raging river.
But the dinosaur's undersea tomb preserved its armor in perfect detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular species are so well preserved that fragments of skin still cover the full-sized armor layers along the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such conservation is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it becomes.
Fossilised skin fragments still cover the full-sized armor layers that dot the dinosaur's skull.
Right front leg is extended sideways, with five toes tilted upwards.
I can count the stamps on the foot".
Don 't be so hard on yourself when I say whitening .
White teeth and a beautiful smile is everyone's dream.
While people are resorting to various methods to whiten their teeth, Nükhet Berk, president of the Oral Laser Applications Association, warns against products sold in supermarkets or online.
"The teeth can be whitened with chemicals applied by dentists or with thin porcelain surfaces that stick to the surface of the teeth like nail moulds", says Nükhet Berk, who notes that such substances are used to paint the surface of the mine and to stain the teeth so that they are never recycled.
Berk noted that the protection of dental health prevents the occurrence of many diseases, and that aesthetic practices are important for mental health by providing both dental and gum health and a beautiful smile.
Unless there is a defect in the structure of the teeth or genetic factors, the teeth of adolescents are usually white.
Teeth become darker over the years because of aging, scratching of the teeth, and frequent consumption of cigarettes, corrosive or dark-colored beverages.
Tooth whitening can be accomplished with chemicals applied by dentists or with fine porcelain surfaces that are sticky, such as artificial nails, that are applied to the surface of the teeth with minimal or no abrasion.
You should never whiten your teeth with products sold in stores or on the Internet.
Because these materials paint the surface of the mine, staining the teeth so that they don't recycle.
Since 2011, the Keçiören Municipality has been providing "Home Dental and Oral Health Services" to elderly, disabled and bedridden citizens.
"My wife was aware of this service of the Keçiören Municipality", said 65-year-old Köksal Güngör, who has been living in bed for 24 years in the Wake Up neighborhood of Keçiören.
We called the city, they came right away.
"I'm paralyzed from the neck down", she said, "and this service has helped me to keep my teeth clean".
Kezban Gökçe, the 72-year-old daughter of 95-year-old Gülizar Taşçıoğlu, who lives in Pınarbaşı Mahallesi, said, "My mother has been bed-dependent for 7.5 years because of her old age".
When I got to the city hall, I saw the signs for this service, and I called.
We've been getting this service regularly for four years.
I have a problem with my teeth, and the doctors come and look at me.
He used the expression "very pleased".
There is no health insurance requirement for the service, which is completely free.
The "old age" incident in the Turkish army
Dear readers, at the meeting of the Supreme Military Council (YAS) the day before, very interesting decisions were taken, especially with regard to the Navy.
This force is not commanded by an admiral, but by a rear admiral.
It's almost unheard of in the military.
And how did that happen?
The force commander, Admiral Bülent Bostanoğlu, had already served his term, and was about to retire...
And it did.
Now it was the turn of the commander, the only one, Veysel Kösele.
Veysel Pasha, who was a former victim of the coup and was imprisoned for a while, was supposed to be a commander in the normal ranking.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to be very concise, starting at the top of the Marine Corps, Commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 have not been promoted.
That leaves the Navy with one rear admiral.
The vacant post was to be filled by him, Admiral Veysel Kösele, Navy Commander number two.
And then what happened?
The sixth ranking Corporal Adnan Özbal was appointed to that position by the government.
Now look at this painting!
That Admiral Veysel Kösele is standing there but he is being replaced by a lower-ranking commander!
A senior is being put in charge of a junior.
I wonder what happens next.
An admiral who is superior in rank, does not, cannot, serve under a colonel who is inferior.
He doesn't take orders from him.
In that case, Veysel Kösele will not tolerate this painful situation, and if he is not retired, he will resign today or tomorrow.
This is the hurtful message that the government has sent to him: "Goodbye, Veysel Pasha!"
Yesterday afternoon, as I was writing this, news broke that he had resigned, but it had not yet been officially announced.
Now let's look at this again!
The government opposed Veysel Kösele, refused to do so, forced him to resign and replaced him with a 6th ranked officer, thus undermining the traditional concept of "Kidem" in our army.
There must be politics involved, and we don't know what's behind the scenes.
Maybe soon, if someone tells us, we'll all find out together!
Dear readers, I tried to explain very briefly above, especially in the Turkish army, the seniority issue is very important.
Not just in rank.
For example, an officer who graduated 10th in the War College is older than an officer who graduated 11th.
The first-ranked general is senior to the second-ranked general.
We saw concrete examples of this in the War of Attrition.
The commander of the Garp Front, Ismet Pasha...
You have two armies.
The Army and the 2nd Army.
We're in 1922, and our armies are going to make a great offensive and drive out the Greek army.
At this stage, there are valuable names that are expected to be appointed to the command of the army.
One is Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He is offered the command of the army, but he says, "Ismet is inferior to me, I cannot obey him".
Another name is Yakup Shvki (Subaşı) Pasha.
Atatürk's teacher at the War Academy...
A valued and senior commander, who he loved and cherished, and who he called "Teacher", and who fought in many battles.
In 1919 he was captured by the British and deported to Malta, along with soldiers and civilian Turkish intellectuals.
When he returned home, he was reluctant to take command of the army and said the same thing: "The commander of the Western Front is not my superior, I cannot take orders from him".
But Atatürk convinces him gratefully and Yakup Shevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha. He is the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood.
A soldier who talks a lot, always criticizes.
A commander who fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran, and various fronts.
He is deported by the British to Malta, escapes from there and comes to Ankara via the Beltway.
When he was offered the command of the army, Ali Ihsan Pasha said the same thing: "I cannot fight under Ismet, who is inferior to me"...
But he's being convinced...
But come to see, after he started the mission, he is constantly arguing with the commander of the Garp Front, Ismet Pasha, causing trouble and disturbing the army...
And shortly before the big raid, he's retired from his post, replaced by the bearded Nurettin Pasha.
After that, Ali Ihsan Pasha's relationship with Atatürk never gets better.
The Turkish army's seniority problem is not only in war but also in peace.
Of course it has to come out.
Veysel Kösele is the latest example of this.
How does an activist have to find out the answer to the question "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
The day after he arrived in New York City for a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of his rented Airbnb and started surfing Facebook on his phone.
It just happened to be shared by someone in high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and he's still lying on the street".
When he realized that no one else had shared this information in the content stream, he was surprised, so he shut down Facebook and started Twitter.
A user nicknamed @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted in his content stream.
Rapper from the St. Louis area was tweeting live about the death of Michael Brown, who was killed at the age of 18 by an unarmed black, white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He shared a photo of Brown's serial corpse in the street, which he's gonna be there for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is brutal".
But death was not new to him or to his society.
He left his phone to return to tweets about the crowd on Canfield Drive later that evening.
There were police tapes, people screaming, and a man holding a sign that said, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another cop, he said, pulled the trigger and shouted, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals".
Ferrell remembered saying, "This is unusual".
"'This is not a typical murder of the kind we are accustomed to.'
I felt a chill at that moment.
I was angry and I was crying".
He booked a return ticket and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., he picked up his 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to take her to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary coming to theaters on August 11 called "Whose Streets?"
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of power and resistance, told from the perspective of the people who live in that community and fill the streets with the answers they seek.
Ferrell drove to Ferguson with his daughter, who wore a floral dress and a matching crown, and they returned that morning to a conversation they had repeatedly had earlier, "about the experiences of black people and the condition of black people".
He remembered saying, "Remember when I taught you that black people should fight for what they believe in?"
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't true.
I couldn't help it".
"What is happening here today is a consequence of what happened in the past.
He's got to know it, see it, and grow into it.
It should not only be well-developed in activism and organizing, but it should also know the layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we need to do to liberate, to liberate ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn't personally experience gross racism, she's no different than any black woman-child.
I feel that by protecting her from that, I am doing her harm".
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was South Florissant Road, which had become a sort of campground for activists, opposite the police headquarters, where they waited for Officer Darren Wilson to speak about the matter, which later resulted in no criminal charges being brought.
There, Ferrell and her daughter made contact with local business owners who prepared packaged food.
They packed bags and helped deliver them to the protesters.
A new kind of activism was slowly forming for Ferrell.
While a student at Missouri State University, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and injustice in health care in the black community, noting, "My activism completely changed after August 9".
"I had no experience in organizing.
It just came out of nowhere".
Weeks later, Ferrell met with one of the film's co-directors, Sabaah Folayan, at an evening show.
Folayan said he and his own image director Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.
Ferrell had a question in his mind: "Do you want to document or do you want to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism was expressed by countless individuals, mostly white, who came to a society to profit from its suffering and resistance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson couldn't concentrate, and we decided to do it differently".
Folayan had already made contact with co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism on death row.
His involvement warmed Ferrell to the project, which the "Whose Streets?" team, along with six other area natives, followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This is not a documentary where someone speaks for us or speaks to us; we are the ones who speak", David said.
"That's what was important to me, how these people were going to be represented, because that's how I was going to be represented".
Folayan spoke in a way that "while the goal is not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, he proved to be the most open of film participants, showing that the movement is not about a "Messiah leader, it's about the community coming together".
As a result, "Whose Streets?" surprisingly documents personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as his falling in love and marrying his wife.
Ferrell laughed at the first sight of the finished product, saying, "I felt like I was naked".
"But I realized that in doing this and humanizing black people, there might be some sensitivity".
And Ferrell's story reinforces and re-centers the role of black lesbian women in the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who inspired the #BlackLivesMatter slogan on social media after the murder of a black teenager, Trayvon Martin, in 2012, identify as gay.
"Black lesbian women in leadership have generally kept the movement going", said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at war on many fronts.
Black lesbian women have to carry the full weight of it".
Folayan added: "The movement is really being sustained by black women and many gay black women".
Yet Ferrell insists that "this is nothing of the sort of affirmative action" and that he was not chosen because of his identities.
"He was the one who set that energy in motion", she says.
"But it's no coincidence that she's on the front lines, because as a black lesbian woman, you have a lot to lose by living a life at these intersections.
You can feel his energy on the screen".
In Ferguson, meanwhile, the news cameras are long gone, but there are still disturbing racial connections between the community and the police.
Ferrell is on probation for another two and a half years for shutting down the highway during a demonstration.
The socio-political atmosphere in the area he calls home is, in one word, "confusion".
And yet, Ferguson still remembers the song he wrote three years before he took to the streets.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our job to win.
We should love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains".
Kyrie Irving: The earth is not round!
"The earth is not round", Irving told NBC Sports.
The world is flat.
They train people to do this by scaring them.
Oh, man, not too much.
Because the more information you solve, the more information you get.
This is crazy.
Is the earth flat?
Or is it spinning round and round?
I think you should look into this.
I'm telling you, they're lying to our faces.
They're lying to us!
Irving: "I've believed what I wanted to believe for years".
I thought the world was round and spinning.
Do you really think we're going back and forth in the solar system?
Nothing they send back.
He's not coming back!
The information they're giving us is very inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for that truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?"
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, is struggling this season with a Cleveland Cavaliers uniform, averaging 24.4 points and 5.9 assists.
A relevant parallel: The artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room in the New York Fridman Gallery, there are many faces, white, black, and brown, hanging over cables in the ceiling, each with an almost indistinct resemblance to the other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, using earrings and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Former intelligence analyst Manning, who is serving a 35-year sentence for leaking classified diplomatic messages through the WikiLeaks channel, has sent his haircut from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new exhibition, which opens on August 2, is called A Matching Similarity.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her discipline with her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and leading opponent who was pardoned by Barack Obama three days before her term expired.
By algorithmically analyzing the DNA extracted from Manning and creating 30 portraits of what a person with this gene data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg not only revealed the processing of the DNA data (there are many ways to be named and the inherent determinism of interpretations) but also revealed its identity with a tight, perhaps somewhat cerebral interpretation.
Manning, who was born Edward Bradley but openly identified as a woman in his later teens, was convicted in 2013 of 20 counts, including six under the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
His image was suppressed by the prison, so that there was only one photograph: a black-and-white photo of Manning, visibly agitated, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-yellow wig that resonated with him.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was on the cusp of success with the massive release of her 2012 project Stranger Insights.
In this, the artist created portraits by sifting DNA from the debris of forensic pieces like cigarette butts and gum to create a picture of what these people might look like.
Just then, he got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some sort of portrait that could accompany this piece", Dewey-Hagborg explained at the press presentation of the new exhibition.
At the time, no visitors were allowed, no photographs, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she was interested in getting a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected correspondents, exchanging many letters over a period of two years.
They even released Repressed Images, a cartoon book illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, in which the president forgives Chelsea's sentence and imagines a future where she can see the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama actually asked for Manning's release a few days after the book was released was a happy coincidence that came in handy after seven years of atrocities in a military prison in Kansas.
As Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender soldiers and finds new, tweetable ways to further fuel the sharp divisions he is asked to fix, there is something profound and powerful about this exhibit that is now opening.
When asked about the strange timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "Things happen for a reason".
An artist's statement on the gallery wall, with Manning's large-scale signature below it (the dot of the "i" in the last name is inserted with a heart), called for an end to "automatic discrimination" based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.
On the wall, there's his mitochondrial DNA sequence, lots of C's, G's and A's written in lead pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides in the artist's sophisticated science dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to tell how remarkably similar we all are, at least as biological creatures.
"What I hope people will take away from this is that they don't care about who we are and how open to interpretation the genetic data is, how subjective it is", said Dewey-Hagborg, who is exhibiting his video work Simulated Memories in 2007.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, and these are 30 of them".
The last piece in the one-room exhibition is a page from the aforementioned short comic book.
Here Manning is shown, King Kong-style, leaving with a speaker from the United States Disciplinary Barracks.
It says, "They win when they silence you".
"So never shut up".
The artist from Philadelphia said, "This came directly from a letter he wrote to me".
"I still get a little bit of a tingle when I talk about it".
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person (as is quite predictably envisioned in the comic book), but when he does, he will be greeted by masks of his own genetic imitation, which are gathered in the middle of the room like a group of protesters.
Like everything in the exhibition, the genetic haplogroups were written in pencil up to Manning's height (5'2, Manning's height), which was specially made.
Dewey-Hagborg said about portraits, "I used to put them on the walls, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd".
"I wanted it to be perceived as a collective movement, shaped by Chelsea, which was also the movement behind her liberation".
Northwestern education officer and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
Police say a nationwide manhunt has been launched for a Northwestern University education officer and Oxford University employee who was wanted for the murder of a man stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
Cook County records show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for first-degree murder without bail, on the grounds that they had a role in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A notice issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27.
Officers took a call, reached the Grand Plaza Apartments, and found the victim with multiple deep cuts on his body.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and that while police are actively searching for the two suspects, detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was on administrative leave and banned from entering Northwestern's campuses.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the appropriate authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation", said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville University said in an e-mail statement, "We are in contact with the UK police and stand ready to assist the US investigating authorities in any way they may need".
The statement also said that Warren's coworkers were in shock and demanded that he surrender.
Communications chief Anthony Guglielmi of the Chicago Police Department said he strongly encouraged suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
"Police have an idea where they are, but we are intensifying efforts to locate them", Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza, who had just received a mysterious tip that something was happening in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very scary.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident happened on July 27.
He said that Lathem and Warren were confirmed in the building by security cameras.
Guglielmi said, "We believe the victim was having an affair with a faculty member named Latham".
The Grand Plaza administration issued a statement to residents saying, "Police are still working on the timeline and background of the victim and are investigating a number of possible family connections".
Italy seized the German ship
Italian police say a ship called Iuventa, which was searching for refugees in the Mediterranean, was seized on Lampedusa Island yesterday.
The police, which shared with journalists the recordings of telephone conversations, which it claimed belonged to two members of the organization, announced that this operation was carried out within the scope of the investigation launched by the Trapani Prosecutor's Office in October 2016.
It is alleged that Jugend Rettet members, who are also alleged to have been active in the "Libya-Italy line of illegal migration", have brought refugees directly from the boats of Libyan traffickers to Italy at least three times.
The prosecution is investigating the alleged crimes of the Jugend Rettet members, who were working with some members of the Libyan Coast Guard.
The organization said in a statement that it is considering the charges against it, adding that its priority will continue to be to save human lives.
In addition to the Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission ships, about 9 international civil society organizations are involved in the search and rescue of refugees in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government had prepared a 13-point code of conduct for these organizations, requiring them to sign it.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete the WADA roadmap in the short term"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would take a long time for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for it to resume operations.
"A certain stage of the roadmap criteria has been completed, RUSADA has obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this context", Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister was reviewing the second part of the WADA Regulatory Harmonization Roadmap, which was recently published on the agency's website, describing the criteria governing the re-opening of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing to worry Russia about.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future".
However, one criterion mentioned in the list states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly acknowledge the results of the WADA-approved, state-sponsored investigation into alleged doping in Russian sports by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
Referring to the issue, Mutko said: "While our anti-doping system admits a failure, we are conducting an investigation.
All precautions have been taken.
But there is no government program, and we will not accept something that does not exist".
Mutko's words echoed those of the head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission, Vitaly Smirnov.
Speaking to Russian broadcaster RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged past problems with Russia's anti-doping bodies but added: "We have said on many occasions that the report contains conflicting positions and regulations.
No one is considering accepting the report unconditionally", Smirnov added.
RUSADA's doping controls in Russia were suspended by WADA in the wake of the November 2005 doping scandal.
However, under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD), planning and coordination of this June test was allowed.
In July, following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli announced that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to get back into business.

Galatasaray President will not return empty-handed
Former Galatasaray president Faruk Suren harshly criticized President Dursun Özbek, who went to Bucharest to convince Mircea Lucescu and to the capital Ankara for the transfer of Ndiaye.
Here 's the legendary president 's private announcement to the readers of Morning .
Lucescu-Uzbek conversation: "We were finishing when we left".
The Galatasaray President will not go in vain, nor return empty-handed.
The Galatasaray president doesn't go to the footballer.
The football player comes to the President's feet.
Of course they do, whether it's kissing your hand or hugging...
But whoever the player is, the president won't go down on him.
You're giving 9 million euros to a player that Osmanlıspor bought for 300,000 euros...
It's not 7.5 million, it's 9 million with bonuses!
You've already invested a lot, of course you'll play, and it'll be 7.5...
Uzbek's performance: I don't want to criticize.
But the situation is clear.
G. Castle values are eroding.
Not just football, but all of it.
The Supreme Court and the General Assembly are the ones who will change that.
But I understand the members are happy!
Start-ups that will help your company not be the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but the polls weren't working.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or worse, misleading.
Even though he promised anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
"It's never been consistent or objective", says Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company in San Francisco that specializes in hair care.
He called someone outside for help.
A new kind of human resources start-up is emerging to help companies understand how their employees feel.
They're licensing software for the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, allowing companies to run randomized surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, bypass top management and go directly to the board to allow employees to report a malpractice.
Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Glint, a Redwood City startup that uses software analytics tools to measure employee engagement, said, "You have tools like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where's your company's Fitbit?"
Errett says that using Glint, he's gotten a better understanding of what his employees are thinking and feeling three years later.
It provides a heat map, which provides a snapshot of which parts of the company receive the most complaints and which managers have the lowest approval ratings, as well as providing split surveys and optional surveys to specific teams, so that the reasons can be manipulated.
Companies are starting to realize that to not be the next Uber, they need to be aware of the culture of their workplace, which has been in scandal ever since Uber described a harassment environment in a blog post by a former employee where those who openly speak their minds are punished.
For startups like Glint, this demand for oversight means a very lucrative business opportunity.
According to the financial technology insights website Let's Talk Payments, the global management, regulation and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
Interest and activity in Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies detect and prevent bad behavior, has increased amidst the debate over Uber's discredit earlier this year.
Convercent has about 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct personalized "beat" scans, collect real-time secret responses, and map heat to problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous message-box helpline where employees can report bad behavior.
If the president is indicted, the complaints go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and chairman of Covercent, said, "The public court has taken over the regulators".
Quinlan said: "If a company mistreats its employees or does not treat them ethically, it may face costly consequences, such as consumer boycotts, employee disapproval, or lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene".
With over 25,000 employees in 500 locations, the restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday has been using Convercent for over a year to keep its employees informed of policies and procedures and provide easy access to the company's headquarters.
In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or an email address at the company headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope it would be taken seriously.
James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's chief legal adviser, said these are often frightening and uncomfortable experiences, and that it's not a good way to follow up on employee complaints.
But now, with the company using Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from executives who lived away from the office, city or state, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices, can be detected and resolved faster.
Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group, said, "I can take this employment experience even further with a holistic, 360-degree view".
"We also protect our shareholders from business lawsuits".
After the accounting firm Arthur Andersen went under in 2002 over its ethics violations stemming from the Enron scandal, companies took ethics, values and employee relations more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after "social media came to its senses", companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral.
"Before technology was used to control the flow, people used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge recurring fees for the use of their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that has the endorsement of venture capitalists who support both start-ups.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital to $47 million.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
Given the interconnected nature of companies, their cultures, and their venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing number of studies show that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and exciting projects are just the bare minimum.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and that they're giving their time to a company that has a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint, said, "When people are happy to be in a company, feel their voice is heard, and are satisfied with what they do, they are more committed to making that company successful".
Investors make a profit when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when their employees are sincere and feel they belong.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee sincerity and sense of belonging, it's not surprising that they find support.
Having data on employee engagement is important to workplace culture experts.
But data is useless if the people in charge of the company don't act.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create an expectation that change is coming.
And if the expectation doesn't come quickly enough or doesn't come at all, it can create frustration and make employees feel broken.
Russell Raath, who is the head of consulting at Kotter International, a management consulting firm, and who saw that companies made the mistake of relying too much on data collection, said, "If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be prepared to talk to 4,000".
"Because if you don't follow, the employees will think, 'Did you really hear me?
You care about that?
And if you don't care, why should I?'"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day a problem was reported in Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were tired of the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and add communication training to help solve problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights into its employees, and hopes that in the long run, this will translate into being able to retain more workers in this type of industry that is known to have high employee inflows and outflows.
Vitrona said, "If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people".
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies".
NCAA cancelling two practices a day is a long day for the Bruins.
It's 11 p.m. and a group of UCLA football players are hanging out on the edge of the new on-campus practice field to chat.
Some of them are ripping off their uniforms, their backs exposed to the sweat of their first day in training camp.
For a significant portion of the team, these free minutes constitute their midday break.
After three hours of practice, players enrolled in summer classes will return to their homes and take their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for the 6:30 a.m. meet-and-greet the following morning.
Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before he returned Monday, "The next three days are going to be a torment for these guys".
The NCAA's elimination of two practice sessions a day, designed to relieve the players' burden, actually extended their days, at least until the finals are over on Friday.
So the first three UCLA practices are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the already tight schedule of the players.
The payoff for not having two practices per day is more like one practice per day; the Bruins are moving the start of camp forward by nearly a week from last season, and during summer school, Mora will be training at summer school for the first time in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to do 18 practices through August 20 before officially starting preparations for their September opener against Texas A&M.
Mora said the NCAA supports the rule change, even though it added new pens to the players' intense work schedule.
"We put a huge load on them for three or four days", Mora said, "and it's very challenging".
"And they've been through this recently; they're working, great kids.
I think we'll have more time when we get there on Saturday, it'll be really great".
UCLA will stop training at the end of camp, which is not an easy task considering the Luskin Center, a luxury hotel that's surrounded by a parking lot and an adjacent football field, and which is covered by a protective net behind the fort, and which lies within sight of its grounds.
The Bruins are scheduled to move into the hotel this week, but Mora admits there may be a problem with the rooms being vacated during the season.
Mora said, "We'll be safe".
"It's a real concern, and it's not crazy to think that someone would rent a room and sit there and video a workout.
If you have a video of a workout, that's a pretty good thing.
But we'll be safe there, and we'll be safe up at parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna worry about it too much.
We have a plan".
Facebook increases story verification to fight against fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake stories to third-party verifiers and show their findings under the original sharing, the world's largest online social network said Thursday as it attempts to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on the firm's website, it said it would use updated machine learning to detect potential fraud and send it to story verifiers, potentially displaying the story verification results below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main distribution points for what many believe influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political headline in Europe, with French voters being hit by a flood of fake news ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to cut penalties if they fail to swiftly remove hateful posts from social media networks ahead of the September elections there.
In a separate statement in German on Thursday, Facebook said a test of the new story verification feature was being launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Facebook's newsfeed product manager Sara Su said in a blog post: "In addition to seeing which stories are being discussed by third-party story validators, people want more resources about what they read and share to make informed decisions".
He added that Facebook will continue to test the "relevant article" feature and work on other changes to the news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a comic: The story of a castle in England
In more recent times, the tiny Scotney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music video and was a haven for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But now, inspired by a comic book by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with brown hair and a passion for historical documentation, Scotney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent.
"I find it beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years", she says, with a sigh.
"What a personal bond it is to hold this letter".
A Castle in England, dating from the Edwardian era to the Middle Ages, each story documents a family living in Scotney, to be painted by a different artist named from the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg).
This is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he also wrote the 2014 project Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, which he found unexpectedly emotional, inspired by stories in the British Library.
"I even saw a fingerprint on the side of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for King James's supporters", he says.
"That was his thumbprint!
And the letters always smell like wormwood because back then you used to light a fire for the light.
For someone 300 years in the future, that smell makes it feel like he's there.
Oh, I love the archives!"
As a lover of old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and staying in a castle for almost four months ("I've been a little overwhelmed, to be honest, by the warm welcome I received") seems too good.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the "new" Victorian castle, scanning the archives and studying many treasures and antiquities, such as the rattlesnakes' heads mounted on the mansion walls and bottles that had been in the ditches for centuries.
He toured the grounds and ruins of the old castle, talking to keepers, gardeners and sometimes artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then at night he would "drink whiskey and write".
The detailed history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had only just begun to take over the archives, which he describes as, "For centuries, the aristocrats were saying, 'Oh, throw it in the attic.'"
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps that defined the boundaries of who owned what: "You would think land disputes would be boring", says Rhodes, "but there was a willow tree that two families fought over.
Forget about it, guys!"
Some stories in the collection, including The Labourer, who left the newly built castle to take part in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, use the castle as a springboard to make a broader introduction to English history.
"In this book, The Knights of Kent and Sussex, there is a record of a rebellion at the castle in 1380", says Rhodes.
"The peasant rebellion had started in this area, and I thought a rebellion might be a good starting point.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are closely linked to the castle's history, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family who hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, featuring 18th-century smuggler Arthut Darrell, who is thought to have filled a coffin with stones and arranged his own funeral.
The Darrells were Rhodes' most beloved Scotney family: "These gentlemen looked like a lot of crooks, always going into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy older women, and I imagine them as a group of handsome men with the art of wooing female heirs".
With his tour of duty at the fort over, Rhodes is looking for other solo writing experiences.
In the Finnish wildlife, he completed a two-week work for a comic about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium in the early 20th century, which has since been recaptured by nature.
But Scotney holds a special place in his heart.
"I was sad to be separated", she says.
"It's like, 'Oh, I have to go now and face my real fucking life.'"
'Maho' reaction to Meral Akshener
Ismet Büyükataman, General Secretary of the Nationalist Movement Party, made a written statement regarding the resignation claims made in social media and the press regarding the MHP.
Using the phrase "there was a flood" from social media and "some old-fashioned Marxist corners" to the MHP, Buyukatan argued that "games and bargains were resorted to to prevent the first movement from continuing its existence under the MHP's roof after 12 September".
Grandma said:
"He who cannot digest the historical existence of the Turkish nation, who cannot draw the homeland of the Turk, he rubs his hands if his record is broken, his criminal record is puffy, his ideology is blurry, his mind is confused".
"Now they have left" 410 people resigned from the management and members of the MHP Gölcük District Organization in Kocaeli and 215 people resigned from the MHP in Yenişehir district of Bursa.
The public is being misled by baseless unpopular news like 250 resignations, 300 resignations.
The lies are rampant in the newspaper columns, the deception is deep.
There are no resignations in this number, and the number of employees in these places is not much more than the fingers of one hand.
Büyükataman, who described the resignations as "a promise", said that the public was being misled and perceived as a "promise".
"The propaganda and campaigns aimed at creating a perception against MHP will be reversed", said Buyukatan.
The MHP's General Secretary, Büyükataman, expressed that MHP is an important and indispensable actor in Turkish politics, and said about the resignations:
The old Marxists, with their swords, will not be able to destroy the place that MHP has gained in the conscience of the Turkish nation.
There's a dirty accounting behind all the commentary, the perception management methods that are being applied.
Because the politicians and the media are staring at the MHP base.
It makes no sense to us that those who have not done any good work and devotion for the party while they are among us, should now resign.
What a pity that those who can't use our party for their own ends have resigned.
The group that has not touched MHP in their lives, that has not shared our memories, that has not understood our country, that has not joined our struggle, that has always stood on the sidelines, that has its mind charred, that has its heart stones, should find another occupation.
The efforts of those who do not like the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party to incite conspiracy, debate and seek sectarianism are in vain.
And the one who turns back will surely strike his master.
The Nationalist Movement is the last fortress of the Turkish nation that has remained standing despite heavy destruction.
In his explanation, Büyükataman said that the nationalist movement is not without ownership.
"Outside spiders, fed by roots from across the ocean, will not achieve their purpose at any cost", he said.
"The traitors will go mad and be ashes in the fire of hypocrisy", said Büyükataman, who used the expression "from the CHP to the HDP; from there to the Perinçekgillere, from the PKK to the FETÖ" and in his statement listed the opposition parties and terrorist organizations together, saying: "Whoever does what they do, they will not be able to operate on the right of the Turkish nation to own its own destiny".
Yesterday we resisted the new tactics and games of those who plan Turkey without MHP, MHP without Turkesh; We fought until the end with the dishonest people who want a government without MHP, a Meeting without MHP.
Now we're gonna mess up the games, we're gonna mess up the players.
"The patent of patriotism is in MHP", Büyükataman said, alluding to Meral Akşener, using the following expressions: "It is obvious that the resignationists who followed him will say that I am taking you to power and leave you on the edge of the cliff, as in the old Yeşilçam film Banker Bilo, saying that I will take the Maho villagers to Germany, after walking in the truck for days on a mountain slope in Istanbul".
That's their problem, but all we want from these migrants is for them to be new where they're going.
Kjaer signed for Sevilla
Kjaer, who made his move to Sevilla for €12.5 million from the yellow-lacivert team and went down in history as the Spanish team's most expensive defensive transfer, has signed an official contract.
The Danish star will wear number 4 in Sevilla.
Big help for families with babies from THY
According to a statement from THY Press Consulting, the national airline, which puts the comfort and satisfaction of its passengers at the forefront and works to make them feel more comfortable during the flight, continues to develop new ideas for a perfect travel experience.
In this regard, the "baby travel kit" prepared by studying the needs of infants and their families from 0-2 years of age, has been offered to passengers with babies travelling on intercontinental flights since August.
The kit, which is made with a specially designed bag, includes a changing pad, a disposable diaper, cat cream, baby lotion and shampoo, a wet cotton napkin for newborns and a breast pad.
Products that do not contain parabens, alcohol, dyes, or harmful chemicals are made with the sensitivity of the baby's skin in mind.
Washington changes its green card rules
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has said that there will be a new U.S. immigration plan that changes the rules for the Green Card.
It calls for a reduction in legal immigration to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules were proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in both houses of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save taxpayers billions of dollars by changing the way the United States grants green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates who have the financial resources and skills to benefit our economy", Trump said, according to US media.
The writers commented on the Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match
I had the excitement and the glory I hadn't seen for two seasons, the Old Man.
A team of "mangale heart" that Aykut Kocaman brought out in the absence, was on the field to make a "stand behind us" deal with his fans.
We can criticize your play, your positions, your performance, but I haven't seen a game that's so demanding and demanding in a long time.
He showed it in the first game, but yesterday he put his own lapel on his shoulder, and Valbuena is now the field commander of Fenerbahçe.
His age was a problem when he was transferred, but Kocaman had a phrase in his mouth that said "unrelenting character".
30 years ago, we gave the atomic ant the right to name it Reza Chalymbay.
If he can handle it, it'll be the most appropriate comment for a French actor.
He was all over the field, he was in all the passing organizations, he was always taking responsibility and he was also scoring, and he put on a huge show of short stature.
Alper's lead, his second-string position, left Sturm Graz "limited" in the field for a long time.
Fenerbahçe was looking for a formula to get through such a hard wall, winning the circuit without a corner.
They're in control of the ball, but they're not producing any effective passes in the opponent's penalty area.
This image may give the impression of a "centrifuge needed", but we are faced with a play in which Ahmethan is reluctant to pass, and the only centrifuge he has is not able to put him in position.
Either the team didn't trust the young player or his performance needs to be improved a little bit.
After the score was 1-1 they missed two clear chances.
It was important to get through the round, but to raise this fan who was standing up to the players' struggle and say "goal" would have made the night even more beautiful.
Probably a couple more transfers by Monday.
But the fact is, Fenerbahçe needs number 12 the most...
We're on the verge of a very bright and exciting season with this style of play that carries the hearts of those who are trying to play in the front.
Bigfoot's machine is drying up, he needs a little more time.
They're in good physical condition.
The quality of the game will improve.
You can see very clearly that all the players on the field have increased their confidence.
They need the applause from last night for a new chapter.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be concerned
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder, a new report is coming out on the technological advancements in the sex robot industry.
I know.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Responsible Robot Science Institute (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and one of the founders of FRR, we need to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipples, and the type of its nails.
Mr. Sharkey said of the release of the new report: "People laugh at them, but the companies are actually shipping a lot and we're going to see more of them".
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable analogues to robots with silicone skin that is warm to the touch, with a specifically human-like response, performed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize the robot to suit their preferences, choosing everything from the eye color, to the shape of the nipple and the type or color of the nail.
But with so many robots having "personalities" that a Stepford Woman would be seen as innovative, it's even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into silicone-skinned robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows users to personalize their own robots according to character traits they find attractive (e.g. shyness).
Then there are the sex robots Roxxxy Gold, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including the shy-faced "Frijit Farrah" and the "adventurer" personality "Wild Wendy".
The True Companion website is buzzing: "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as best as it can".
So he likes what you like, he doesn't like what you don't, and so on.
They also have mood swings during the day, just like real people.
He can be sleepy, he can be willing to talk, or he can be "in the mood".
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots: not only the replacement of real human relationships, but the overly obedient female personality traits, the violent calls when approaching Frijit Farah are the most thought-provoking.
On the True Companion website, Roxxxy is like a vibrator, but for men.
"If women can have a vibrator (as the text says), why shouldn't men have a Roxxxy?" states the website.
But these sex robots aren't just a fetish or a sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex through submission, an optional addition.
Many men will not naturally own sex robots, and while FRR draws attention to their growing popularity, they are currently on the periphery of consumer culture.
But the leaks from the ends can be highly informative about the course of our times.
And many people aren't weird or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
With a president in the White House who boasts of sexually assaulting women, it's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world.
The most chilling part of The Handmaid's Tale is not the detailed depictions, the body-shaped bodies or the carved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn't feel like much of a change right now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical resemblance to real women as technologically possible (in proportion to porn stars, of course).
Their creators want them to feel human when they touch and they want them to mimic the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personalities", robots clearly can't represent real women.
They can't leave their spouses or separate from them.
No activity or history, nothing to suggest their independence or to disrupt the fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they're pleasure slaves.
Or in the 2017 term: maids.
The attack on the American military convoy, there are dead and wounded...
The suicide attack in the Karabakh district of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
The blast, which killed one NATO soldier and three civilians, also injured five American soldiers and one translator working with NATO forces.
An official statement by NATO Support Forces in Afghanistan (Resolute Support) said a suicide bomber detonated a homemade explosive device during a joint patrol mission by NATO forces and the Afghan National Army.
The injured personnel are being treated at the Bagram Airfield American Military Hospital.
There is no danger to the wounded.
Local media reports indicate that the suicide bomber was a Taliban member.
The great Trump?
To make Mitt Romney look like a symbol of common sense.
The political divide that polarized the American electorate, the micro-division of families, became a reality of the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the newspapers in the United States were filled with how to deal with the nightmare of relatives who voted for Trump.
We're all trying to blow our own filter bubbles into the so-called.
Less talked about is Trump's ability to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and is mixed up with the Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
It reminded me that united against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone he knows, including his Republican brother, who has been arguing politics for decades, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
At the dinner table, that's a good thing, of course, but it seems to me that in a broader context, it carries significant risks.
The left was animated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency created a rightward push for all of us.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the terrifying possibility that one day his bizarre behavior will no longer shock.
There's even a more terrifying long-term scenario where Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who are against his own standards, and they suddenly seem like a symbol of logic.
I find myself living nostalgically about the weird version of Mitt Romney's madness these days: dog on the roof of the car, a 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like), both of which are really minor crimes for Trump.
When Trump is gone, the next Republican candidate needs to be in his right mind to be judged to have made immeasurable progress.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the horse barn in Central Park, the largest of the horse barns operated by the New York City Department of Parks, and the best three-dollar place to spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder (all clowns and animals making strange faces turned to look in terror behind their shoulders) and the humming music is strangely intoxicating.
In other words, many of the clichés of a city can be disappointing: the views of high-rise buildings become boring, the skyline becomes too familiar to create much excitement, and the reality of the city does not reach the dream.
It's been 35 years and I still can't quite get over the day I discovered that Swiss Cottage is actually a wide circular intersection in North London, not a Swiss country house.
But the Central Park ride is still a weirdly magical experience, so two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and two women in their 40s can go here and have a great time.
If I could have given the rider a note, I would have given him a full note, but thankfully no one asked.
On the other hand, I was asked to rate my transactional "experience" between 1 and 5 stars before I passed my credit card in a bomb raid this week.
Same thing at the coffee shop on the corner, plus the option to match the note with a 15% tip for the one you bought at the counter...
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral transaction, but to put pressure on the host to personalize an event that is not needed at all.
While the poor woman at the bombing range stood up and smiled apologetically, I, bored, gave her five stars for my experience with credit cards.
When the temperature was over 40 degrees , they put on their sweaters .
In Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of the season has taken place, people flock to the beaches of Munzur.
As the heat began to subside, young, old, young, old, and old, men and women, who were entering the beaches along the banks of the Munzur River, tried to keep themselves cool in the icy waters.
The beaches along the Munzur River are crowded, especially because Tunisian citizens living in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and England spend their holidays in their homelands instead of the Aegean or Mediterranean.
Suna Tosun, who was among those who refreshed at Munzur Beach, stated that she preferred Tunceli for her holiday instead of the western provinces, "I did not want to spend my holiday in the west. It was better to cool off in Munzur with my family, stay in our own lands".
"The water of Munzur is as cold as anywhere else in the world, and at this temperature Munzur cools us".
Hasan Ulu from Germany said that they preferred the Munzur River in Tunceli rather than the Chesme or Bodrum beaches and that they did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, prison officials took him to the hospital for treatment of injuries to his wrists that he said occurred after he fell in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the prosecutors appealed his earlier conviction for manslaughter.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he killed Steenkamp at his home in Pretoria, shooting multiple times at the door of a toilet booth.
Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for someone who had entered the cabin uninvited at night.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal Pistorius' six-year sentence once again, this time for what they believe to be too light a sentence.
National prosecutor Mercii said he would appeal to the South African High Court and the appeal could be considered this year.
Pistorius faces a 15-year prison sentence if the prosecution succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The first convoy is dispatched.
The pilgrims who will travel to Saudi Arabia under the auspices of the Presidency of State Affairs were greeted with prayers and tears at the Atatürk Airport External Lines Departure Terminal.
The ceremony, which was held at the Terminal of External Lines before the first pilgrimage, was attended by about 200 pilgrim candidates, as well as relatives and citizens.
Turkish Airlines (THY) on the other hand, distributed roses in fuel to pilgrims who were going to the holy land by chartered plane.
The Hajj caravan in Ankara was greeted from Esanboğa.
The caravan also included the martyrs and the relatives of the soldiers who benefited from the "gunless pilgrimage for the martyrs and their relatives" which was implemented for the first time this year.
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Camping Illegally
According to the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and quoted by bTV, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece on the grounds of illegal camping.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in Sithonia on the morning of August 1.
They were released the same day the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened their controls on free camping and are still imposing severe penalties on those caught resting in undesignated areas.
He'll be checking out all season.
The Ministry said the court could impose a fine.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
JOEY Hoffman, 22, traveled to Turkey with two friends to visit in early July.
Joey Hoffman, who was traveling through Adana and Mersin in a rented car, disappeared in Silifke on July 8.
When his friends, with whom he had come, could not reach Hoffman despite all the calls, he informed his family in Holland of the situation.
While the police were on the move to find the missing tourist, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei and Jaimy Gewald went to Adana.

Robin Hoffman, who has filed a police report here, has printed missing persons notices for his brother, distributed them in Adana and Mersin.
"We first contacted the police in Holland", said Robin Hoffman, who said he had last heard from his brother on July 8.
Later, two of my friends and I came to Turkey and applied to the police.
We haven't heard from him yet, and we haven't found a clue.
"We will stay in Turkey until my brother is found, until we get a news".
Congratulations to Ayse Ceren, the second most beautiful woman in the world.
At the 2017 World Youth Championships in Palette Swimming held in Russia, national athlete Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş became the world's second in the 400 meters.
Minister of Youth and Sports Osman Aşkın Bak congratulated Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş, who won the silver medal.
On the first day of the 2017 World Youth Championships in Palette Swimming held in Russia, Ceren Yeşilbaş became the world's second in the 400 meters.
Ceren, with her spectacular performance on the track with 8 finalists, took her place on the second bench, missing the gold medal by just 27 salises.
In the 400 metres, Elena Lopatina of Russia won the gold medal with a time of 03.18.73, while Ceren won the silver medal with a time of 03.19.00.
Turkey is represented by 8 male and 8 female athletes.
His last words were, 'I think I'm dying, goodbye, mother.'
Among the 30 who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which has now been reported, he called his mother at the time of the fire and said, "I don't want to die, Mom, it's not fair".
It was revealed that the Italian Gloria Trevisan, who said "Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye", and her boyfriend were also present.
Among the dozens of people who were unaccounted for after the fire was Gloria Trevisan, 26, who lived on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building, and her Italian boyfriend, Marco Gottardi.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family in northern Italy, said in a statement that information from British authorities confirmed that both teenagers had died.
The lawyer, who said that the families of the teenagers are experiencing great suffering, also asked journalists not to insist on seeking explanations on this matter.
I think I'm going to die. Bye, mother.
Lawyer Sandri said that Gloria called her mother Emanuela Trevisan on her cell phone shortly after the fire and that she herself cried when she listened to these last conversations recorded by her mother.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times over the two hours after the fire, which started around 1 a.m. local time.
Trevisan, who was reported to be calmer in his first speech, said, "Mom, something bad is happening here, there's a fire".
We're stuck, we can't get out of here.
There's some smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting for rescue.
"We tried to open the door and get out, but there was too much smoke and the elevator was not working", he was quoted as saying.
Gloria Trevisan, who was concerned about the fire, said:
Mom, my whole life is flashing before my eyes.
I think I'm going to die.
I had a life ahead of me, and that's not fair.
I don't want to die, and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I won't be able to hug you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye, mother.
I'm going to heaven now and I'm going to help you from there.
This is the fault of the Italian government.
Gloria Trevisan, both trained as architects, and her boyfriend Marco Gottardi, who had been struggling to find work after graduating last year, moved to London in March from the Veneto region in the north of the country.
Gloria Trevisan, who had found a job in her country for only 300 euros, soon found a job in London for 1,800 pounds sterling (about $1,500).
"Gloria had gone to London to help her family", said Sandri, "and the family was having a hard time financially".
Unfortunately, our young people are forced to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government should find a solution to this problem immediately", he said.
The drama of Italy, which cannot provide employment opportunities for its youth
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, expressed his anger, saying, "It is our government's fault that it forces our youth to flee abroad in search of work".
In Italy, the unemployment rate is 12 percent, while the rate among young people is over 40 percent.
In response to this growing problem, many young Italians have begun to emigrate to many European countries, especially to Britain, in the last few years.
Last year alone, the number of young people who had to leave Italy because of unemployment exceeded 110,000.
Commentaries in the Italian press on the confirmation of the news of the deaths of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi also pointed to the drama of a country that is unable to provide employment opportunities for its youth.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may alleviate IBS
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study suggests the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy products may help alleviate symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable health condition affects 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causing stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Although patients are often advised to skip meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein, the essential amino acid tryptophan, helps develop immune cells that develop a resilient gut.
Dr. Marco Colonna, the lead researcher, said that immune cells patrol the intestines to prevent germs stored in food from sneaking into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote endurance, protecting sensitive tissues from damage.
If the balance shifts too much toward inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines have developed a type of immune cell that promotes endurance.
And the bacteria need tryptophan, one of the building blocks of the protein, to trigger the cell to emerge.
'We have linked the development of a cell population that promotes resistance to Lactobacillus reuteri, a bacterium that is part of the gut microbiome,' said Professor Colonna.
Mice with more tryptophan in their diet had more of these immune cells".
If the same thing happens in humans, he suggested, a diet rich in L. reuteri and tryptophan could develop a more resilient, less inflammatory gut environment.
While working on a type of immune cell that enhances endurance, postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas discovered that one group of mice had these types of cells, but another group of the same species held in a different location did not.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiome of mice, in other words, the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
So we did a DNA sequencing of the intestines of the mice, and we found that the mice that had immune cells had six types of bacteria, but the mice that didn't have them, they didn't have them.
Mice that were treated in a sterile environment and lacked a gut microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cell were given L. reuteri and immune cells were shown.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of this bacterially-free liquid to immature immune cells from mice.
The immune cells became the cells that promote endurance.
The active ingredient was found to be a byproduct of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indole-3-lactic acid, when purified from the liquid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the levels of tryptophan were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that humans have the same cells that promote endurance as mice, and that most of us have L. reuteri in the gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop in humans as they do in mice, but disorders in the genes associated with tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
He said: "The growth of these cells is probably something we want to encourage because these cells control inflammation in the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, in cases where L. reuteri is present, high levels of tryptophan are causing this population to spread".
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United has signed a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic
After the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic.
The £40 million move from Chelsea began with United's 2-1 win against Real Madrid in the final pre-season game in Dublin ahead of Tuesday's UEFA Super Cup, and saw Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira in a position to hold off as they forfeited their forward to their delight.
However, Matic, who was left out of the Mavillers' pre-season Asian tour, was severely lacking in match condition and was only able to play 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that this had to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
Mourinho said, "He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his genius in thinking... he thinks about football".
"We'll help him get ready sooner".
As Mourinho began to shape up his first XI for the start of the season, like Matic, his new transfer buddies Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also appeared at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more transfers but the club had already insisted he had done "an extraordinary job" by completing three of his four priority transfers.
"Thank you to the club for taking three of the four", he added.
"I'd be happier if they took four out of four, but they put a lot of effort into it for me".
Last year, 197 people were sent to the hospital.
According to the Swedish Social Welfare Institute, the rate of gender dissatisfaction in 2005 was 1 in 100,000 people, but by 2015 it had risen to 8 in 100,000.
Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital has had 197 newly admitted people, mostly children and adolescents, who were dissatisfied with their gender at birth.
Child psychiatrist Lousise Frisen, who works at the same hospital, said that the increase may be due to a more open society, "openness in the psycho-sexual field, including questions about sexual identity, can be perceived as a general development in society".
It's known that gender dysphoria has no connection whatsoever to sexual orientation.
Drug operation in Izmir
The teams of the Office of Smuggling and Combating Organized Crime of the Payemish District Police Department conducted an operation on the house of 36-year-old F.T. in Ülker Street, 3 Eylül neighborhood.
A search of the house found a delicate scale containing 33 extacy pills.
F.T. tried to jump off the balcony and was caught and taken into custody.
It's been reported that F.T. will be sent to court after his security clearance.
Evkur is transferred to New Malatyaspor
Evkur Yeni Malatyaspor, one of the new teams of the Super League, tied Turgut Doğan Shahin, a winger who wore the November uniform last season.
According to the statement made by the yellow-black club, a two-year contract was signed with the 29-year-old winger as part of the transfer process.
In the statement, "A two-year contract was signed with Turgut Dogan Shahin, a wing player who wore the uniform in Kasımpaşa.
Good luck to our new Malatyaspor".
A British inventor implanted a microchip into his house and car with a gesture
A British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip attached to his body to enable him to open his front door, access his office, and even operate his car with just one hand.
Steven Northam, 33, has transferred the tiny chip between his thumb and finger, and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology through his company BioTeq.
To ensure that the implant procedure could be performed to medical standards, Winchester went to work with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted in cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will also make changes to the locks on homes and vehicles at a cost of £300 per lock to make them chip-compatible.
The man, a married father of one, has this technology installed in both his home and his BMW Z4, and it keeps the car running while he has his hands on the wheel.
The White House parade cost thousands of taxpayers
According to military records released to TIME, the White House's decision last month to fly a Marine helicopter into the grasslands of the South for an organization that promotes American manufacturing cost taxpayers up to $24,000.
When the president boarded, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of the organization's July 17 presentation of American construction programs at the White House.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured the products manufactured in all 50 states.
A Connecticut-built helicopter, a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a fork lift from Mississippi were displayed side by side.
According to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit in charge of operating the helicopter, the White House War Department requested the helicopter's presence in a separate order (also called FRAGO) just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern grasslands for an "unusual" organization.
The commander of HMX-1, the day before the organization, sent an e-mail to the Vice Commandant of Marine Aviation, who was in charge, saying, "I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusually high-visibility organization".
The message said the helicopter would arrive on the south lawn around 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. organization and stay there until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m.
The note added that if departure from the White House was delayed, a second flight crew would be needed for the return flight due to duty time restrictions.
Unit security personnel were inside the aircraft while the aircraft was on the ground, while the original flight crew was in the helicopter during the organization.
The records provided to TIME make it unclear whether a second flight crew would be necessary.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The records show that HMX-1 is investigating whether the organization violated this requirement.
The commander wrote, "A question we asked was whether he violated the Hatch Act, and we were told he did not".
"Looks like you're stuck", the Deputy Commander replied.
The Made in America organization is officially designated by the White House and is not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official organizations have political implications.
In the organization, the president referred to the health care reform efforts that were underway in the Senate at the time and praised the government's efforts to rein in regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for political advantage is not new.
Presidents are supposed to use these to travel.
But it's unusual that they're officially requested to be used for a photo opportunity only.
Trump drew attention in February when his presidential plane moved backstage to the first campaign rally in Melbourne Florida, and his Twitter account was filled with messages about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the 'Made in America' exhibit, which features products made with American materials by American workers from all 50 states", said Lindsay Walters, deputy press secretary.
The HMX-1 crew frequently makes training flights in the Washington area, and on the south lawn, they practice dropping the President of the United States into the White House with a point-blank range.
While Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
An official said the flight, for the Made in America organization, was considered the training requirement for the flight crew that month.
Unit helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said taxpayers didn't charge for any other tricks involved in the organization.
A spokesman for Sikorksky said his company was not involved in arranging the display of the helicopter on the south lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact expenditures incurred by the organization.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense's rate of admission to the VH-3D is $24,340 per flight hour.
Unit logs record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes each way from the Marine Corps Air Facility headquarters in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House claims the actual operating cost of the helicopter is far below that.
"It's very misleading to charge taxpayers based on estimates of the rate of return", Walters said.
"These estimates include the cost of personnel, maintenance and annual costs".
A 2015 RAND study found that the Department of Defense's expense coverage rates do not include personnel costs but include fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated that the helicopter be used for this organization.
Spicer said, "The idea here is to show what's been done in America this week".
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contributions to our national security, and I suspect that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans, like many Americans, have worked tirelessly to build.
So it's certainly appropriate to bring it up".
It's unclear if Trump interacted with the helicopter while touring the southern grasslands for the organization, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump joked with the media about the company's products in his fleet, addressing Sikorsky's representatives.
The president said, "I know Sikorsky very well. I have three of them".
President Erdogan's goal was a joy

According to BM, Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women.
The head of the B.M. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can be representative if all segments of society, including women, play a role.
Nicholas Haysom, vice president of the BM Relief Mission, says hundreds of women are running for county council, three are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
In his statement on Wednesday, he said, "The role of women cannot be overstated".
Elections can be truly representative and credible if only women are fully involved and included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have threatened the election process, which coincides with the turn of international military operations into a consultative role.
This year's elections mark the first time that power has passed peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that the powerful role of women will contribute to the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women registered to vote out of 3.6 million registered voters.

Their mother went shopping, two children died in the fire
According to the information received, in Sayağzı neighborhood, women named Sevgi Karakan and Güneş Yapal went shopping at the market.
Sevgi Karakan left her 3-year-old son Hasan Umut Karakan and Güneş Yapal, leaving her 9-year-old son Aykut Yapal and 4-year-old son Durdu Yapal with her 18-year-old daughter Ummuhan Yapal.
After a while, the house caught fire for some unknown reason.
Ummuhan Yapal, who could not stop the fire, went out of the house and fainted.
The surrounding citizens immediately informed the Mersin Metropolitan Municipality Fire Department.
Firefighters who arrived at the scene and conducted extinguishing work inside the house found the bodies of 3-year-old Hasan Umut Karakan and 4-year-old Durdu Yapal.
It was found that 9-year-old Aykut Yapal was not home at the time of the fire because he had gone to the grocery store.
While the families of the dead children were having nervous breakdowns at the scene, the police launched a full investigation into the incident.
GMB's concern over McVitie's investment in the Glasgow plant
A union is seeking assurances from the management of biscuit maker McVitie's that it will be given a long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow factory.
GMB Scotland said the company remained silent on the future of its investment in the Tollcross area.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, said they've invested more than £5 million in the area over the last few years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "first informed" if there were any changes in operations.
In a letter to the company's plant manager, GMB Scotland requested McVitie's to "address concerns about the lack of funding for the modernization of its production lines".
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "Our members are deeply concerned that we have not seen clarity from the general manager of Thesis on business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross.
Families have worked here for generations and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and in Glasgow and its suburbs, which are a critical base for adequate employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
From a job, wage and welfare perspective, the Brexit conditions, rising living costs and chronic production decline are urgently requiring a four-person manufacturing presence in McVitie's, east end of Glasgow".
A spokeswoman from Pladis said: "The plant manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland just yesterday and the company will respond directly as we value our commitment to workers and union representatives.
Two months ago, at Tollcross, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives where we discussed several issues openly.
So we told our employees that, like all companies that operate in a highly competitive and uncertain economic environment, we are constantly reviewing our operations to stay competitive, which is true for all of our businesses and facilities.
He added: "Over the last few years we have invested over £5 million in the Tollcross facility, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We are fully aware of Tollcross' legacy as a manufacturing facility, and if there is any change in our operations at the facility, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know".
Necip and Utku will be in Beşiktaş for another 4 years
The Beşiktaş Club has extended the contract of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran for 4 years.
The information on the website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) shows that the club has extended the contract of two players until 31 May 2021.
Necip, who grew up in the black-and-white team's infrastructure and made his first professional contract on 19 June 2008, began to play for the A team in the 2009-2010 season.
The 1991-born player, who rose to the rank of team captain, played a total of 254 official matches in the Beşiktaş uniform.
The TFF website also reported that the Beşiktaş signed a contract with Utku Yuvakuran until May 31, 2021, taking the bonus service of the goalkeeper Utku Yuvakuran, who was included in the squad last season.
The information on the website shows that Utku was removed from the temporary transfer status as of August 1, 2017, and that his license was renewed on August 2.
Utku Yuvakuran played in the 21 Under Six League matches in Beşiktaş, where he played last season on loan.
The young goalkeeper has only played in 2 Turkey Cup matches in the black and white uniform.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's departure three years ago?
La Liga side may have regretted their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on Neymar after offering a £189 million release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record they set three years ago?
The sensational offer has set the summer transfer window in motion, with the Ligue 1 side set to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous amount when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
With PSG offering a £500,000-a-week salary after taxes, it suggests that Neymar will be the world's most expensive player and also the highest-earning professional athlete when the transfer is completed.
Barcelona are known to be angry about the style of the offer and Neymar's attempted departure, although a source close to the Catalans' management has insisted that the club has always done its best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
So, was the football world warned about this sight three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to all clubs wishing to sign one of PSG's best players.
Al-Khelaifi said, "I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll then go against them, we'll contact their players".
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll suffer the consequences".
Barcelona seem to have crossed the line earlier this summer, when they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG have made it clear that they will not allow the Italian national team to leave under any circumstances and Barcelona is feeling the reflection of this interest by losing their greatest values Neymar.
The penalty for blocking the reading of the Sala was reversed
The defendants Kenan Gulsen and Nait Yılmaz, who were alleged to have tried to stop the march on the Imam of the Gületep Mosque in Küçükçekmece, who was studying Ezan and sela, were charged with "not knowingly and willingly helping the organization despite not being members", "resisting to not do their duty" and "insulting" Istanbul 22.
He was tried by the High Court.
The jury decided to fine Gulsen for the offence of "insulting a public official for his duty" and for the offence of "resisting to not perform his duty" and sentenced him to one year in prison.
The committee ruled that the prison sentence given to Yılmaz should be converted into a fine of 6 thousand lira.
After the two defendants were fined, the defendants' lawyers appealed.
The case is being reviewed by the Istanbul District Court on the 23rd.
He came to the Department of Corrections.
The appeal was rejected on the grounds that the sentence imposed on the accused Kenan Gulshen for the offence of "insult" was applied in the legal context, the action was correctly characterized and corresponded to the type of crime provided for in the law.
When the accused Nait Yılmaz read the Salat and met the Imam Mustafa Baki, he said, "You are not throwing the people out on the street".
The president has been taken.
The court noted that the act of attempting to walk on it, hitting it, caused the victim to not be able to read the zanan and the slay, which the imam had to read at certain intervals.
The district court noted that the victim had not been charged with any crime, and that the court had not discussed whether the act constituted an attempt to injure the victim due to the public duty performed by the victim, and that the sentence was insufficiently justified, so as to allow the accused to verify how the victim had achieved the recognition that he was trying to prevent the victim from performing the tasks he would later perform.
The prosecution stated that the defendant had no criminal record, that there was no material harm to the victim due to the crimes charged against him, and that there was no discussion whether the moral harm would be applied if the sentence was not imposed and the victim had withdrawn his complaint.
The court ruled that the verdict was annulled and the case was returned to the court of first instance.
Six Europeans on the Interpol list of live bombs
The German newspaper Die Welt reported that Interpol (the International Police Organization) sent a list of 173 people to law enforcement agencies in European countries last May, including those who may have carried out suicide attacks on behalf of the terrorist organization Daesh.
The 132 people on the list were reported to be from Iraq, North Africa, Gulf countries, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
Six of the people on the list were European citizens.
These people are said to have come from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
The suspect from Germany, who has DEAŞ ties, is a 27-year-old German citizen from Solingen, North Rhine-Westphalia.
It was stated that the person in question had first gone to Egypt, then Turkey, and finally to Syria in the autumn of 2012.
In a statement on social media in mid-July, Daesh said the man had died in Raqqa.
The German Police Agency has not responded to the newspaper's questions on the subject.
It was suggested that the names on the Interpol list were seized in operations against Daesh in Mosul.
According to Die Welt, the American intelligence services reviewed this list and sent it to Interpol.
Interpol was also recorded as having forwarded the list to police agencies in Europe in May.
Die Welt cited German security sources as saying that ISIS may be trying to send some of the names on the list to Europe to carry out suicide attacks.
The terror of the soldier with a bomb rifle: 5-year-old Yıldızsu may lose his eye
In Job, blood was shed in the military salute of the youths.
A crowd gathered in the park in Karadolap neighborhood to bid farewell to their friends who were going to join the army the night before.
Allegedly, M.K. and O.A. from the group fired from time to time in the air with pump-action rifles.
After the soldiers' farewell, the group began to disband.
M.K. passed a playground full of kids and shot a handgun to the ground.
One child sitting on a park bench, five people injured because of the crap that was done on the floor.
Those moments were captured on the park's security cameras.
The injured were transported to nearby hospitals by ambulances.
The five-year-old Yıldızsu Unus, who was treated at the hospital, was at risk of losing his left eye.
Yıldızsu's grandmother, Mary Kaya, told the DHA about those moments.
Kaya said that the incident happened when she was holding her grandson, "The celebration of the soldiers started at 8pm".
It took two hours.
The military fun is over.
The young people are starting to disperse.
It would be the same if we left when it was over.
That's when the gun went off, right in front of me.
My granddaughter's not well.
He's got an 80-90% chance of losing his eye.
We talked to the doctor, he said so.
