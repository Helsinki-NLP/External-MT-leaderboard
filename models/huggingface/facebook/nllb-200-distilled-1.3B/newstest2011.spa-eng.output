The ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the bakery.
The new ČSSD councillors in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, the obvious language barriers so that the Prague City Council and City Council members can understand their newly-found SDG colleagues.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the slang-marked language that has emerged in the Council in recent years, when the current members of the coalition governed Prague.
The coded dictionary that used the political flower and cream of Prague during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the metropolis' best-known characters, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, new council members have been found to have little understanding of these familiar concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know, really".
"I am rather a newcomer to Prague politics", said culture councillor Lukáš Kaucký during the terminology exam for "college".
And as far as the veteran politician is concerned, Karel Březina reacted the same.
You may be familiar with the concept of a golf hole.
"It's probably the only expression of all the ones you asked me that I use now and then".
"Otherwise, I don't usually use slang".
From the glossary, the definitions of which were published by Aktuálně.cz in June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial board selected six examples, in particular those that are particularly relevant to the municipal authorities in Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "largest golf hole in Prague", "going to the bakery", "bull neck", "treason of the capital" and "armor".
Three councillors agreed to take the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague in the future, initially agreed but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused to do it directly.
"I don't get involved in these things, nor do I value how civic Democrats have fun".
"What does matter to me is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programmes", he said.
As has been seen, the councillor Lukáš Kaucký would have allegedly not realized that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of the former mayor of Bém, Roman Janoušek.
Kaucký doesn't know the word "Voldemort"; the only term he got right in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel", says Kaucký, who immediately adds: "But I know more from the news".
"I'm gonna have to sign up for a language course", he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel on the golf hole, but also the Environmental Councillor Lukáš Plachý.
Afterwards, both social democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character; he also suspects the meaning of "going to the bakery".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; soon Plachý learns that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
Like Březina, he indicates that such knowledge he obtained from the news, but that he does not use such a vocabulary.
According to the test participants, no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms exists among social democrats.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really doesn't seem like we have anything in common".
"Rather, we use nicknames among ourselves, sometimes abbreviations or word games with names", says ČSSD Prague chairman Petr Hulínský, whose party mates call her Hulda.
"In school I was called Bříza, but I don't know if my classmates call me that", confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and it works.
To his party comrades, Weinert is Děda (similar to "boy") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old man"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom he was associated before the election during the party's sponsorship deception, receives the nickname "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his comrades.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that the Social Democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínský does not like to be called Hulda, but Aktuálně.cz newspaper discovered even other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The Doctor of the Rights of the Bat" apparently remembers that Petr Hulínský obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", as published in a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually of advanced age, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, single and childless.
Women who "become" witches are sent to a secluded area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men seldom suffer such a fate".
"Nor are healthy young women isolated, because they help with the work and have children", explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, works in a special residence for more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an informational pamphlet that should help prevent witch hunts.
This has a downside, though.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso are illiterate", warns the newspaper Die Standard about the disadvantages of written education.
Charges of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week when she was tortured, covered with gasoline and burned by three women and two men.
The news came on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate combination of circumstances.
According to his version, the woman caught fire in the oil used for ritual anointing.
It caught fire when the group wanted to "exorcise the evil spirits" from the woman.
Isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
"Soul-eaters have always been a danger", said a 42-year-old businessman in Burkina Faso, quoted in the newspaper Der Standard.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to quell the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president was still involved.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a massive witch hunt that allegedly had been linked to her death and had attempted to kill the president himself using black magic".
"To help him, he brought in shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, took by force randomly selected men and women from the Gambian villages to the president's property in Kanilai", Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the arrested people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay at the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand people detained.
Bakala tenant: heating with coal stoves and signing a higher rent
The man, a hardened elderly man, walked through the doors of the customer service center of the RPG Byty company of "coal magnate" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of rental flats in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried some documents with the new three-story lease contracts: his, his daughter's and his son, who is serving his sentence.
The three of them just got caught up in the rent liberalization.
Instead of 3,500 CZK a month, the child will pay from next year onwards 4,100 CZK for a two-room flat with a separate second-class kitchen.
"Moreover, it has no hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler", the man points to his son's new contract, on which he has full powers.
"But I signed it", he explains, half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants not sign new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide on how to proceed in these cases.
But man only makes a fuss.
"Each one says one thing", he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a great testing ground for liberalisation.
After the New Year, this will happen to the vast majority of apartments which in the Czech Republic were previously rented under regulation.
So Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right by the doors are the security guards and next to them a number machine.
"Rent 2011", you can read it on a bright button on your touch screen.
When you press it, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
It takes almost no time to read "157" and the number is already on the big screen at the top of the room.
In a second, you'll be in line.
Soon after, an elderly couple arrives to ask questions, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: claims for repairs, insurance matters and the like.
The letters with the new lease contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 apartments belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters a rent increase of between 15 and 38%.
On 18 November a special window opens in the customer service centre for new rentals.
"It's been working for a week, so it's starting", respond, after a brief hesitation, the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalisation and the former miners' flats of Bakala are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were already treated loud and clear by the Ostrava-born deputy speaker of Parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, and now they are continuously appearing in local newspapers.
"Twenty years later, I want a new floor".
"They didn't even change my damn bathroom dish", says the man mentioned at the outset.
According to the workers, for the time being they come mostly retired to check if they get a discount on rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new lease before December 15 will also receive half the discount on the February rent.
However, the window of "mining liberalization" certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty people asked for rent in 2011", the window clerk estimates.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on its website and boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties cannot reach an agreement on the rent, an independent judge must decide the matter.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and fully lawful way forward", warns RPG on its pages.
"No one is going to be judged here", says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the customer service centre agrees, at least in part.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court", he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see about that".
"Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait", he says.
Rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents still do not even cover the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund", recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the neglected state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in apartments with rent four billion, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.200 million.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data highlighted in red.
'The increase in rents in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties.'
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month", the screen says.
Only increased by 38% the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
'In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts of 19,66 crowns per square metre,' RPG says.
At 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not affect rents suddenly, but will scale up between four and eight years.
It also adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent increase (see chart) back into the flats, mainly in savings on heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to people who sign the rent increase agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need daycare.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would think that it also hides a small nursery with everything that is typical of such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch.Design employees can come to it.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio many well-known buildings in Brno came, thought from the first sketches of the building Avriopoint to include a space for its mini-nursery.
The company employs about 90 people, mainly in the baby boom era and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of a reduced working time, daycare is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers its employees as part of its social programme.
Women builders and architects are thus able to combine a demanding job with childcare.
The mini-nursery was an idea of the Arch.Designu employees themselves and, with the support of management, they managed to secure funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's day care is financed by the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment and the Czech State budget.
The financing provided (a grant of over CZK 2.8 million) enabled them to purchase the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified staff and services.
When the funding is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design is obliged to keep the mini-nursery running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project took one year and the application for funding was supported by Economy Rating.
The children are cared for by qualified staff, and a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day to care for them.
Since it is a "mini-nursery", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children at a time, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the daycare is flexible to suit the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the daycare, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although the programme is individual in nature, the content of the programme is comparable to that of the regular preschool.
It is not only a place for children to play, but also a place for them to receive quality education: from basic learning to school preparation, including English.
The classroom has not only toys and board games, but also a computer for the children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive atmosphere.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up children late from school when they are away from their workplace.
This way, parents are more productive while working.
Not surprisingly, this naturally creates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
Arch.Design is thus among the signature companies that offer a major advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, in short, this programme has strengthened the marketing of personnel.
The house of bones still fascinates after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs look like the column of a dinosaur, and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its skeleton-like shape, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Its organic forms, striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all are typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The front of the house plays with dreamlike lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and wildlife.
Paying closer attention, you notice a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, as it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is enhanced.
Snake and the twist of forms continues to amaze us inside as well.
The wavy wood copies the window frames, railings, door ornaments, viewpoints, and signs.
The Batlló House, located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively Passeig de Gracia shopping street, was built after the remodeling of an 1877 house by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Batlló House, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated on the design.
In fact, in his plans for the project came up decorations for the representative apartment of the property owner and the mosaics used on the facade.
Other creators and artists also work on the facade.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Batlló House was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and the Güell park of Gaudí, where other pieces of it are located.
Because of its organic shape, the locals soon after its completion nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Others, because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it "the house of yawning".
It is also said that, at the top of the building, the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of the building conceal religious motifs.
Gaudí designed a unique system for the time of central heating in the house with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
It may be strange to see its 45-degree incline.
During construction, Gaudí did not respect the building codes of the time at all and was not influenced by them.
Nevertheless, the construction was given the necessary permit from the outset, although the information on the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, when it was completed, the city council was so impressed with the result that it asked for it to be corrected.
He was bothered, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather the opposite: just fifteen days after the request of the city council, Josep Batlló applied for (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owners have moved into the lower floors.
In the second floor gallery was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely traversed by a stairway leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common area can be fully connected by opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
Also impressive is Gaudí's play with light, white and blue tiles covering the inner courtyard and skylights.
The two-color game brings maximum light to every floor of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit the Batlló House, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most fully furnished apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very profitable business and expanded the visits to the common area and the buardilla, including the roof terrace.
The price of admission to the monument is not insignificant, reaching 16,50 euros, although students, pensioners and tourist card holders get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly befriend a resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose mattress and top: Women and men look for different things
Nothing about a pompous bed frame; what really gives a good bed its quality is the surface on which to lie down, that is, the mattress and the bedside table.
First of all, they must be perfectly complementary so that they are adapted to the particular users.
Numerous factors come into play during the choice, including the owner's weight, height, health status and sex.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the mattress top are placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cottage that is not usually heated, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
They also weigh considerably more than regular polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them over more often.
If the central channels are not properly ventilated and are above on a firm base, they hold moisture inside.
When choosing a bed, customs also play a role.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling comfortable on a lower, harder surface.
"Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here".
"For their bruised shoulders, heels and hips, they needed mattresses with a soft viscoelastic layer".
"This type of mattress is also recommended for people with diabetes who have problems with the nervous system, which makes them misread information from the joints and skin", explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these proper Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico".
You don't have to be an NHL player to appreciate viscoelasticity anymore.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape based on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing puts pressure on it; it won't spin around like a hard game at night.
It just makes you sleep better.
Viscoelasticity also acts as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of your feet, which is between 21 and 34 centimeters.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for one person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, for a total of 180 cm.
For single rooms, for example single rooms, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
So a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple rule can be applied to calculate the width: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk to your elbows", advises Helena Prokopová, an engineer and Cechu Čalouníků expert in decorating, who has been working for many years on the subject of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture, which she teaches in special schools.
In double rooms, each room needs its own bedside table and mattress, so when buying, you should pay attention to mattress height.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the beds at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, models with a spring interior at least 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres are for the coating that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"When touching it with your hand or when settling on the mattress, the springs should certainly not be noticeable", warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a specific type of sock.
Fully padded bedrooms, where the mattress and base are like Siamese, have no meaning in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash their covers, which is often done today.
And since we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat each night, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that talk about a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, the vendors advise: For mattresses that are 120 to 140 centimeters wide, carefully clean and wash the cover, but add a protective mattress that can be removed and washed easily.
Although mattress covers are currently manufactured with zippered closures around their perimeter, so that when they are opened they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling in larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a flyweight and a heavyweight.
In bed, instead of a bedside table, do you have a hard board?
I never did!
As much as the beds designed to last a night of visitation.
However, it should make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes in the board and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (like the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft coating.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-jointed sheet tops containing 14 to 18 sheets, latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fibre) may be used, although a tops with a higher number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the lumbar sheets are reinforced and can be regulated in their stiffness is always preferable.
The articulated sheet sockets should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special attachment of the sheets that allows the sheets to be pressed or even tilted so that they "circle" the shoulders perfectly during sleep.
For men with very broad shoulders, it's a very important thing.
Even mattress manufacturers remember them, who in the "male" mattresses began to use a softer area just around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are summits with cross- or table structure with the so-called multitorsion cushioning.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is lowered.
You should also note that even if you use the right mattress and pillow, if you use a bad pillow (large and "dull"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can relax.
The recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, which is normal in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder-strengthening cushion or the softer part of the mattress) as the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses seem to have something to do with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, organic mattresses are in vogue.
The petroleum-based raw materials used to make polyurethane foam are filled with natural oils, such as castor oil or soybean oil.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soy.
"Organic, in the case of mattresses, means that the centre is made of only natural materials", explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "cool" themselves with vegetable extracts from the breeze, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "warm" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel warmer.
The favorites at the moment?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foam and viscoelasticity allows mattresses to be made from different areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns and upwards.
Those with a therapeutic function are usually taxed less, as they are considered to be medical devices.
The first to obtain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's hard to save on mattresses and socks.
Sometimes offers from manufacturers or sellers can be accepted, sometimes offering two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a Memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is free.
The era of viscoelasticity with an open cell structure and high density began with the "cosmic" Tempur material.
It was originally developed for NASA because during takeoffs, astronauts were subjected to enormous overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Thus, the human body, when warm, exerts a perfect effect and adapts its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal for preventing sores, but also for improving sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similar foams.
More and more parents are using tracking devices to monitor their children
Fear of children is leading more and more people to think about tracking them by GPS.
The system, originally designed for vehicle tracking, can also track people's movements and thus contribute, for example, in the case of the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a matchbox, but soon it will be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Anička and began to be informed about the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading their privacy.
"We all try to tell ourselves that this is not spying, but another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy", says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that in certain cases such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone's purse without their knowledge, but we have not yet come across such cases".
"Most customers actually buy it for safety reasons", Pilin adds.
He believes that children should always know what the "box" is for and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns that if a child does not want to carry it, he will simply throw it away.
"Even young children are very creative about intentionally missing things if they want to avoid being controlled".
"In the past, parents relied heavily on cell phones, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device", says Bočková.
In his view, it is questionable whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If it is a premeditated abduction, the perpetrator will almost always check whether the child is wearing some kind of electronic device that can reveal his location".
"Now it's the phone".
"As the use of tracking devices grows, you will also be looking for them, as their sale will undoubtedly be highly advertised".
"In such cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an impromptu attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if the tracking device is destroyed immediately after an attack, their presence can be helpful.
'The device can be configured to regularly send the position after a certain period.'
"If it is damaged, at least it will provide the last position of the person in question".
"The most expensive devices have a built-in tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and remains motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question", says Čech.
In its view, such a service can be obtained even with navigation-enabled smartphones, on which only special software must be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a size similar to a matchbox or the smaller mobile phones.
So you can get lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, for this reason, tests are currently being conducted with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device".
"Or that he identifies him after a certain time, which can buy the police time", he adds.
Although tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hung, they will still use the same technology as is used for vehicle tracking.
This is the checking of position with a GPS system (used in normal navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough flares to surround the whole of the Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of fuse to ignite explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense added to its arsenal 224 kilometers of wick.
So they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is, the lifespan of the fuse is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosive fuse from STV Group, a.s. for forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometers of mecha a year.
According to the calculations of the army's pyrotechnics, with whom MF DNES contacted, it is decided however that, in such a case, they should carry out such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
Neither Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr nor Army Captain Vlastimil Picek wanted to be exempt.
Only then could the army be justified in spending 60 kilometres of wick.
That length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if it were, the army would have enough supplies for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally recently to Minister Vondra because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so even the practice of shooting is limited for money.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also cannot understand why we are repeatedly bought such quantities of wick".
"But it's their decision and they will certainly know why they act this way".
"For us, the army is a good customer whom we as a company try to satisfy", admits Jan Děcký, commercial director of STV Group.
Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometers of mecha by saying he will also have stocks of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of STV Group points out that the wick has a lifespan of only four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four years", says one soldier, who declined to be named because of possible criticism from the army.
After the end of its service life, each round must be carefully checked to see if it is still reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of mecha, he got a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than last year's order of 244 kilometers", says Pejšek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense's shopping center.
For comparison's sake, the annual consumption of wick by police pyrotechnics, who dispose of World War II or Soviet army ammunition, has not exceeded 1,500 metres for years.
Also, the police always ask only for just enough ammunition to run out before the end of its useful life.
They decided to do so for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of wick can be obtained.
The Ministry is already having clear difficulties in finishing tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: hundreds of kilometers of old mecha will have to be removed, which is now being bought "cheaply".
I still live off the contacts I made through the contest.
The fact of winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun in selling the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition, the contest "Entrepreneur of the Year" was won by 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story looks like something out of a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
While abroad, he realized that there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price in Liberec.
With the savings he had made from seasonal jobs abroad and a bank loan, he bought a half-ruined five-story house.
Considering he was still in his third year of college, he was really brave.
"At present, the value for money of accommodation in our area has motivated me to do something about it", says Lukáš Pytloun.
He started renting the rebuilt first floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned he reinvested back into the building, which he gradually converted into a 54-room boarding house.
Since then, in seven years in business, he managed to gradually open in Liberec four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise", said the number one entrepreneur last year.
"This sale of hotel licenses was helped in large part by winning the 'Entrepreneur of the Year' contest", adds Pytloun, grateful.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, they still complimented me often, and I must say, I was very nice", he recalls.
He would certainly recommend that anyone who wants to try out a company that is participating in the competition.
But he feels that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live off the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
"I have started to collaborate regularly with some people I met through the contest".
The reputation associated with success, in his view, also included in the employees,
About seventy in all.
"I've seen them show greater loyalty and pride in being part of something that got general recognition".
"It is not, by any means, my own personal success, but the result of the hard work of the whole team".
"Only my name is on the front page", says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a calmer year than we had at Farmet .
The euphoria of victory was soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the winner's hard work, Farmet may have already been through the worst.
The owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, won first prize in the last edition of Vodafone's "Company of the Year" competition last year at the "Slavonic House" in Prague.
The jury appreciated her efforts, with which she managed to turn a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award encouraged not only me but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition", says last year's winner.
The story of Farmet Company begins with a desire to do something useful.
So when the state offered Karel Žďárský's father the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of property during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned from his position at the company where she worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest automated press manufacturer in central Europe.
They have also gained a greater presence among the non-specialist public after achieving success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers start to see the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners started to value working with a company that was more successful in their country", says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, perhaps, was not only a show of victory euphoria at Farmet.
It was also recognised for its commercial performance up to 2008 and partly in 2009.
And it was precisely 2009 that was the hardest year for machinery sales.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet affected so many citizens, caused companies to halt their investment projects and to start to limit the purchase of new machinery or technology.
"We, of course, are not exempt from that situation either".
"Revenue fell by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs", explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable enterprise must sometimes adopt even unpopular measures.
However, they managed the situation and maintained the company's profits, albeit at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite everything, where Farmet didn't cut spending was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened our presence on the international market and won excellent ratings at national fairs", says Žďárský.
All indications are that they have already put the crisis behind them.
The revenue increases again and with it the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere", says Karel Žďárský.
A survey that exposes ridiculous standards
The Absurdity of the Year poll is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He's already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the year's Absurdity poll was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than a third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested an extract from the business register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the poll, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the business register when it checks the insured person's taxation", said ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to find out what rules and regulations businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must abide by and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year it is taking part for the fourth time in the business tournament of the Hospodářské noviny publication and is also starting to create a hobby among the general public.
While last year's edition had three thousand voters, this year it has practically reached four thousand.
And this is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations to be respected simply to trade.
"We are perhaps the world leader in the number of paperwork required for tax returns", says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, in comparison with the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, eight places lower than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first held in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can point out some administrative or bureaucratic nonsense every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. The competition organiser then chooses seven candidates for the "pre-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
For this year's survey, more than 100 were submitted, including 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent by businessmen, professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" in the competition were, for example, the requirement that vehicles for road and highway maintenance pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year's seventy proposals is published on the contest pages.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which political and social figures usually participate.
This year, for example, the competition was attended by Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continually impedes businessmen, so my aim is to remove every year at least thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade", announced Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not going to stand idly by.
In 2007, the most annoying thing was the obligation of the entrepreneur to notify the business office of the permanent operation area three days in advance of the intention to go with a position to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was removed in the new industrial law.
The obligation that finished second in the number of votes in 2007, that is, the notification to the employment office by its foreign workers of business trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the so-called green card law.
And the third one goes to the loser.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their office a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
That is why this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had removed the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognises socially responsible enterprises
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are valued.
The new feature of the fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competition is the category "Responsible Enterprise 2010".
The aim of this competition is to support responsible and fair enterprises.
"We want to support companies that are concerned about the impact of their activities on the environment and that support socially responsible activities", says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafone, the mobile operator which organises and sponsors the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of Vodafone's main competition Enterprise 2010, companies were submitted for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies widely from one to another, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, for example, disabled people, in another personal or health problems of employees.
Among the 14 finalists from across the country was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a responsible company in the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main funder for the support of disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery shop which is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, who make up over 70% of the workforce.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which reduced working hours even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The certificate was also awarded because it purchases primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities have the least possible impact on the environment", explains entrepreneur Miluše Ryznarová.
The IT company Enlogit in Ústí Region also cares about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, has provided them with an ergonomic chair and keyboards; it also supports work from home and uses the catering services of a local protected company at its business events.
"We also support the 'Person en détresse' grant, which specifically helps the local Roma community", says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
The laundry company Praní a čištění in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive special bonuses that affect their pension funds, is also in a good place.
"We provide benefits in food, transport, skills upgrading and leisure", says Josef Strapáč of the winning construction company Bruntál Czasch in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category of responsible company of the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Enterprise of the Year contest who answered the questions on the registration form and sent it to the organisers before 15 August were automatically nominated.
The organizers removed from the evaluation forms that were incomplete or incorrect.
'If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the responsible company of the year competition, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone company of the year competition.'
"Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the main competition of Enterprise of the Year", explains Karel Goldman from the consultancy Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the building of the Agricultural Fund in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police made several arrests in the building of the Agricultural Fund in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media businessman and real estate developer Luboš G.
It appears that the latter is attempting to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights so that the auctioned land would be given to a specific interested party.
I had to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for it.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public litigation", said Právo the head of the prosecutor general of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the moment can not disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
How he could influence the public auction, given the limited official information, can only be speculated.
The spokeswoman of the Agricultural Fund Lubomíra Černá answered Právo's questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at the Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
"It is a customer, not one of our workers", he said.
According to Černá, the public tender is called 'Call for proposals for land transfer pursuant to the Land Law' and is carried out when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a value greater than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced".
"According to the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the largest offer", explained the Fund's spokeswoman.
Luboš G. had information on who was to be invited to participate in the call and, as he was also an interested person because he had acquired several restitution rights, he proposed to the interested parties in the land that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
That would explain why, at the time of his arrest, he had so much money on him.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for some time.
It was in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund land intended for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular on the site where a major road to the Borská pole industrial area is to be built.
Then he exchanged them very profitably with the magistrate for a house in the very historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because otherwise the blocked land would prevent the construction.
Families will have to pay an additional cost of several hundred crowns a month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The price of electricity rises by 4.6%, gas by around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The electricity price increase for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 crowns more per year than now.
However, the main electricity suppliers reduced prices, as support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular PV, has increased.
However, gas is becoming moderately expensive, especially when heating is used more and therefore consumption is higher.
In this case, you should also have a couple of hundred crowns more a year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the country, the price change for central heating varies from place to place.
The price hike is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay an additional 50 CZK per month for central heating from January onwards, while families in Liberec will pay an additional CZK 1,000 per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent does not change, the Prague residents will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
They may significantly increase rental prices for 450,000 apartments rented in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, will increase rents by up to 100% from January.
The company will take to court anyone who disagrees with the new lease.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of about 300,000 flats, could rise next year by up to 10%.
The young Czechs get drunk on Fernet and rum.
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from his parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to get over a hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases at hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes too long to get drunk".
"Now the trend is strong alcoholic drinks", Luděk Pelikán, chief of pediatrics at the Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia, tells Právo.
"When they manage to grab a bottle from their father from the cupboard, it may be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka".
"The advantage of vodka is that it is lightened with juice and has a less pungent odor", he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokeswoman of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Usually, it's Fernet or rum".
"Those are the modern alcoholic drinks, particularly among schoolchildren".
"In some cases, they use spirits they picked up at home", Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelican, it's 13- and 14-year-old drinkers who usually show up at hospitals.
Before moving to Hořovice, where she has been working since this year, she worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times".
"It started at age 12, when she was brought in with 3.5 alcohols in her blood, plus a blend of ecstasy", says the department doctor on this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party".
"The interesting thing is that her mother was not surprised that her daughter disappeared for 48 hours", the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest or even clear tolerance of parents toward their children's drinking that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that in the case of children, there is no such thing as dependency.
"An alcoholic is defined as a person who has been chronically dependent on alcohol for several years, with all the associated phenomena, which do not occur in children".
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is more likely due to a systematically failed social or family environment", explains Chief Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman Jurinová, this year in the pediatric clinic of Motol were hospitalized until mid-November forty drunk children.
However, statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and must stay in hospital.
Young drinkers who, after a roadside medical examination, go home to their parents or the police, don't count.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink spirits, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs worth mentioning: Witches' Day, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"In such a situation, they drink to the bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays".
"On Halloween, I have seen up to seven drunk children admitted at once", adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in rehab under the supervision of doctors paradoxically have the advantage of not having a terrible hangover at home the next day.
Morning headaches, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, are prevented by injecting a serum with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They're better off, because after a hectic night, they get up and feel no pain".
"They're just confused about where they are", Pelikán notes, adding that patients often lose their good humor at least when they see the expenses they've generated.
The cost of an ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a critical care unit can run into tens of thousands of crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost them and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a youth work if you were to earn enough to be paid that night", adds Pelikán.
The health insurance, in his view perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually reimburses people for treatment costs, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159s are in the hands of foreigners in Spain for the first time
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced with the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the Casa aircraft manufacturer - EADS is based.
It is the first time that a device of this type has been in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad for practice or demonstration flights.
It is the two-seater version L-159T1, which was used by the Czech army until then and was still in flight condition.
The remaining three aircraft are the single-seat L-159s.
These are still being held at Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company Omnipol, already took over them last week.
Jan Peješk, from the defense press department, indicates that it is not yet known when the planes will be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seaters, on the other hand, were separated from the repaired aircraft for some time, without additional investments or contributions from the Ministry".
"The two-seater L-159T1s were exchanged in their current state", he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army is not without two-seat aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for an amount of 200 million kroner for the construction of four unnecessary two-seat L-159 devices.
One of the new planes was delivered to the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to adding the aircraft to the equipment of some Allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the company that will retire the L-159 aircraft and that they will be used for pilot training by NATO countries".
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how they will use them in this context", says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published early that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159s.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.500 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense directorate claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159s abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so they want to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already sued the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice for choosing the aircraft by a European tender rather than by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at Prague's Kbely airport in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men with a longer index finger than the ring finger are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the startling conclusion of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
It could be dependent on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that relative finger length may be a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men up to 60 years of age", said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should be screened for prostate cancer, particularly if this trait is associated with genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, Eeles says.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart on more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a right index finger shorter than the ring finger.
They were as likely to develop prostate cancer as 19 percent of those with fingers the same length.
For men with an index finger longer than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60 years of age, the reduction was 87%.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers in question, as determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have shown that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he is aware of the study, but that he does not think that the link between finger length and cancer can be "fully demonstrated".
Czech Republic in snow: D1 and D5 closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, was covered in snow on Thursday.
Roads and sidewalks are mostly covered in compact snow and snow machines have been running all night in many areas.
In the morning the D5 road between kilometres 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov was closed due to various industrial and passenger vehicle accidents, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was broadcast by the operator of Ústředního automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
In the 91st kilometer a truck broke down, in the 93rd two industrial vehicles collided causing injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should either drive slowly after Brno at kilometer 190 or cross Brno and join at kilometer 182 at Kývalce.
Traffic jams have formed there for several kilometers.
There was also an accident on the D11 road, just outside Prague.
Prague is covered in a layer of snow several centimeters high and the thermometers are at -7 degrees Celsius.
Traffic is becoming congested in Prosek, for example, although Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transportation is the subway.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three fast.
The problems concern, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from 11pm on Wednesday until 5am.
Today, most roads in southern Moravia are free to drive, but with extreme caution.
Three secondary roads are closed to traffic in Vyškovska, snow is forming in Brněnska and chains are needed in Blanenska to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the worst affected places was Vyškovsko.
The following routes are currently closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment, we cannot say when they will be opened to traffic.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
Roads in the region, which, as a protected natural area, should simply be left inert, are piling up up up to five centimetres of snow, ČTK reports.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, while more fell in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reached 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about six inches of snow fell.
Snowfall is gradually receding in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American military is deploying in Afghanistan a new "smart" weapon, known at the moment only by the code name XM-25.
The generals hope the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the game progress" to their victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol with extremely precise aim.
His bullets are laser-fired with a range of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive load it contains make it actually function as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Certainly, normal protection cannot be used, and when it casts its murderous shower of metal splinters, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it so that it finds the target, points at it with its laser beam, which determines the distance, then gets a precise aiming point and, accordingly, corrects the line of sight and pulls the trigger".
"Let's say you have measured 543 meters".
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and launches the projectile from a distance of 1,400 feet [543], or about a foot [1,2,33]", Audette says.
400 jobs are being moved
The Fujitsu consortium is moving its branch office from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will move their workplace from their former office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance giant announced on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their former office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman said that in the medium term another 100 employees from the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will be housed there.
The offer is highly attractive, plus the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, 'In Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.'
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
The head of the Frankfurt economic section, Markus Frank (CDU), said that a "Global Player" had been won.
This is a "great site reconnaissance".
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) is sorry about the decision of Fujitsu.
The management informed the city earlier about their intention.
"We have naturally offered the company our help", Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts between the computer manufacturer and the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz could not change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons brought about the drop.
So now there's a big empty seat to fill in the famous stall.
"I hope the owner and the landlord of the building will be cooperative".
The building formerly used by Fujitsu on Rathausplatz and the adjacent Kleine Vertikale were part of a controversial resort town construction project for ten years with the remaining buildings on Marienbader Platz.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the town hall a new entrance to the city is formed, which takes care of the criticism as to the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and as to the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment advisory and valuation companies, the manufacturer of software for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu have been installed.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later sold to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu consortium is recognized as the world's third largest IT supplier.
It has businesses, for example computers and servers, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is established from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the next subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDS.
That's why they've rented 7,000 square feet in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the twenties, its name alludes to its star-shaped plan, houses among others the central association of electronics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels the server - threats against Assange
Anger is taking over WikiLeaks more and more.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Perhaps behind it is political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is reportedly being held in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, increasingly strong in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an internet homeland in Europe.
Well-known US Senator Joe Lieberman calls on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, should remain in custody in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks has been removed from Amazon's server".
"Speak freely in the land of freedom", activists of the revelations communicated via the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had deleted the Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had turned to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services website to cope with the high access figures to the documents.
Wikileaks explained via Twitter: "Perfect, we will use our dollars to hire people in Europe".
If Amazon has problems with free speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped the use of its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman requested investigations, CNN reported based on a call to Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate National Security Council had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I had wished Amazon to take these steps earlier, before the previous releases of classified information through Wikileaks", the senator declared.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban in other countries the use of the server.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and reckless process puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world", the independent senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks with its service to spread stolen material.
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently called the investigation in Sweden a plot by his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange".
That is why he fears for Assange's safety, Hrafnsson said.
So the location of the WikiLeaks founder remains unknown.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to the statements from North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has claimed that the man responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations should be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper claimed, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
A great dispute is growing between the White House and Assange.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has asked for the Secretary of State's resignation, in case she is responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website", Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your website".
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Counterterrorism Center, has been named special agent in charge, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in light of the WikiLeaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the entire government information and protect it.
In addition, the US government announced that to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to contact them", State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are prepared to help protect you if necessary".
The ice cream college.
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream makers are prepared in the best seasons of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream makers has the highest turnout and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all this ice cream actually come from?
From the ice cream man and the ice cream maker.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The ice cream maker pulls the cream out of the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the barrel and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream college with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream makers has the highest turnout and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream shop of the house.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk on the soft ice cream their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia and Hungary.
Jacky, a California ice cream teacher, loves the slow movement of food and wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant who wants to create something of her own in a few years' time in a daunting job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of their ice cream bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The ice cream master Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants later the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste but also its silky softness and good consistency are decisive.
Luciano does not forget his training or the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why every ball has something romantic".
The first step to the elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients - milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers - into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it to four degrees.
Then you turn on the tap in the machine and a pasteurized white basic cream comes out, the basis for all kinds of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made with only natural ingredients or without stabilizer?
How can you let go of some of your desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that you beware of the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not just natural ingredients", perhaps used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, from guar beans.
Of course, you can make ice cream without a stabilizer. You just buy it one day, put it in a bag, and the customer will bite into a loud granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are permitted.
Fragrances are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between ingredients that are bought in the fruit or candy section of the supermarket.
Plus, there's powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to slip flavored ingredients into their merchandise".
"But you must try it sometime".
Either with sugary fruit sorbet and fresh fruit.
Or even with the white basic dough ice cream, which with eggs will turn to a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate pleasures.
Now the course participants can use the freezers.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla ice cream each time, chocolate, moca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They do the same experiment with other types of fruit ice cream.
It doesn't necessarily taste better if it has more tofu or more fruit purée.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn't have to taste like nuts if it contains more hazelnuts.
The task force makes the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mix highlights the flavor of the ice cream, says Luciano.
The preparation of ice cream is an arithmetic problem: Peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream needs an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano takes out a tool with which he fixes the amount of sugar in the fruit types (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make it easy.
Making ice cream requires only physical application, as before.
It is not only the utensil for the automatic processing of the basic dough that helps.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice-cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to sub-zero temperatures.
All the automation is left out of the small stuff, though.
Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his teammates from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if he were a giant mini-premiere without control.
"In all courses", says teacher Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens".
Inspectors in a difficult situation
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has infiltrated the industry experimenting with GM plants.
This is currently being formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well", Christoph Then, head of Testbiotech, said on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the head of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, and another EFSA expert have also been employed for years in the ILSI association.
Consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer are paying for it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to EFSA's testing standards for genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, then criticizes.
The EFSA provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation on Ilsi's situation and mimic the writing of the company, which is in fact controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a conflict of interest.
So recently, a senior manager at EFSA went without support and transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and she has changed her side with it.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, carried out by the Environmental Office as well as an EU Parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, EFSA cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some from industry, are used, provided they are of high technical quality, and are arranged in a report.
The experts working at EFSA are not required to have no contact with industry.
But you must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others, for risk assessment for biotechnology without Lobby's mandate.
In this regard, independent experts such as Then criticize the fact that GM plants are currently allowed without research into animal feed and that the influence of GM plants on the environment is not proven.
"We want to know what, for example, GM maize does in agriculture", says Then.
Current practice is to check only isolated proteins, but not the whole GM plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you going to find them?" asks accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been researching since 1994 in the field of genetic engineering and currently works at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That's why there are few scientists who aren't influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not usually published.
"The industry controls the safety research", Hilbeck maintains.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell has got some, totaling about 400 kilos.
On Monday, I was outside Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind me.
There were demonstrations
It was snowing.
The story is well known: In September, the bulldozers arrived and began tearing down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: thousands and thousands demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
Because it was sealed off, most of the wing was in ruins.
It breaks in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics".
"They must not disappear".
He exclaims, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural".
Like you said once, he smelled cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what to do with the pieces yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell is too.
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tübingen in a former French Navy ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals in antique stones.
He bought everything that came from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, they would grind the gravel or send it to the garbage", he says in his office, a small wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
He talked to the enemies of 21S for several days.
And he explained that he couldn't do anything about the shooting.
And when it did, it was the most reasonable thing to do, when the stones were still being used.
Some 200 S21 enemies took the 80 kg-long, cut-up, single-piece, mazzito, with a price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half of it is still in the woods, the rest was sold a long time ago.
Owner of gardens, landscaper, project manager.
They came from all over and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of momentum has long since become the "wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special", says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component".
He climbs up to his SUV, takes a tour of his great 20-acre kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, became interested in computers and finally works with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
It holds 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the biggest dealer in antique stones in the country.
Pull the brake.
In the snow are artistic sandstone chops.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge", he explains.
Dawn of lime, yellow, warm, he gets excited.
"My dear stone".
The road goes through the forest.
It points a lot: red sandstone, a former piece of Karlsruhe station.
And keep going.
"Beautiful travertine".
The Mazzios used to belong to the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from Sankt Blasien Church, tub from Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple tool and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed".
He hasn't gotten rich, not immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to do the stone dealer, plus quarry workers, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying", says the man in charge of the wreckage.
He's going to Cologne soon.
There are stones to be salvaged there too.
Talent struggle around great potential
There's an active influx of people at the buffet.
16 students huddle around the buns, tomato soup and candy.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students in mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, you have to talk about the car of the future with the VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Competing and in the same way, many companies, like VW, come together in a hand-to-hand struggle around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Their mission: To hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And because universities don't provide publications about their students' skills, they try to spot exceptional talent in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunschweig, the consortium wins over the talent.
A young lady from the personnel department handing out pens, rubber bands and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the enthusiastic young talents the internship programmes and student jobs and shows them their ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is leading the project with VW.
See benefits for both parties: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience".
"In turn, VW can get to know the students, look more closely at the interesting candidates and consider them as potential future employees".
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are desired so directly.
"The main focus was previously on technical projects", says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
I would like to say that I am very pleased that the Commission has taken this opportunity to make a statement.
All students of engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 engineer vacancies in October.
And according to the VDI forecasts, this engineer gap will grow even further.
At the auditing and consulting firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organises expensive recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern Yinka, in which participants have to find their way by GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the United States next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG's subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It's decided who should go in two rounds of election at the exit.
Only the cream of the creme of many participants goes to the United States.
Universities are making increasing efforts to pick and polish the high potential of universities, according to Dykta.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race".
"The simple journey alone was too short".
For the scout Dykta, the grades give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all participants".
"Some are near the end of their lives, and they want to apply to work with us", he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also on the hunt, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their job fairs.
"We try to get students at the trade fairs".
"Something about Intersolar", says Sitha Stübe, a personnel officer for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The company Bonner has approximately 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
The company's website currently lists 35 vacancies.
"It's getting very complicated to fill the vacancies".
"It takes a lot of time and money", he says.
A shorter route is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher education institutions, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"The teachers advise that you can do internships with us or write your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium is not usually able to offer this", says Stübe, the person in charge.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute annually draws up a list of the best German employment providers.
It asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in it and observes the employees' previous conditions.
Stübe, the personnel manager also expects extra points in her ranking for her job candidates.
"I think the applicant is particularly interested in the external ratings of a potential employer", he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to gain a good reputation as employers.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your employees", he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Employer Branding Internal, also promotion of corporate identity within the staff itself.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors".
When you treat people well and identify with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer from friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game", says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has been done in recent years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby irrevocably cancelled his previous plans.
New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
The reason for this strict ban, which will be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April.
Before the disaster that killed 11 workers and caused the largest environmental disaster in the U.S., President Barack Obama had allowed further drilling in the western Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to reduce the U.S. dependence on new foreign oil supplies.
To this day it is not entirely clear who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the centre of the criticism is British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of lawsuits.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium following the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out another catastrophe by employing tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
The responsible supervisory authority, which has fallen into disrepute after being accused of corruption, is now being radically reformed.
Obama announced in parallel that the lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia would be closed.
The industry is publicly announcing that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to tighter regulation, to date.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries", says the result of the current survey by consulting firm BDO - ahead of Wednesday's extraction ban.
The American Energey Alliance complains of insecurity in the sector: "Nobody knows exactly what changes with regulation".
Investments in new extraction projects are being delayed for the time being, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonland is ruined.
The water in the rivers is brownish oil, smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of oil spilled have destroyed nature in Nigeria's Ogoniland.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari seems to be fine with it.
"Don't get tired", the environmental activist reassures reporters: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes".
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph children wading in water up to their chests with the glow of lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
You don't see brown oil spots floating on the surface.
I used to catch shrimp here by the hand, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was spilled into the formidable wetland through a broken pipe.
Fish from the vicinity of the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: This, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the world's most stinky regions.
On the way along the river's path through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown broth, and whoever dips their hand in the water will get a few full of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the colliding palm trees and hanging their palms.
They search in vain for flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetland as usual: As soon as the barrier outside is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm of a former paradise with gas station smell expands in it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle", says Celestine Akpobari, with a sigh.
The war comparison is in progress.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battleground for years: the first European explorers broke into the area over 60 years ago, the first resistance was organized here in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, the Shell consortium had to set up its first factory here in 1993 because it would be too dangerous for oil workers.
Even today, companies are forbidden to return to Ogoniland: While pumping more than two million barrels of black gold daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location too unstable for the consortium.
Every 200 meters, steel platforms protruded like bizarre water sculptures: "Christmas trees" they affectionately called the heads of the drillers.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them show complete corrosion.
Every moment a head fails, Akpobari says, then a constant jet of oil pours into the water.
According to experts, over two billion liters have been spilled into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil is penetrating, as in the wreck of the "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaskan Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While the Shell consortium and organized oil theft are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see heads about to break and leaking pipelines as the main culprits.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the world conventional ones, reproached scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: Only the pipe fault rates are "about a multiple higher than elsewhere".
In a place that seems forgotten from afar, a workshop full of oil appears under the open sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered in oil.
Among the many barrels, sometimes attached to the drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered over the ground, a fire burns: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated on the fire for hours, explains Michael, the group's leader.
First, gasoline enters the tank through pipes, then the oil pipeline leaks, and finally diesel comes out.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-liter barrels of diesel daily: "It brings us 34,000 naira", about $22 (U.S.).
Delta residents are taking advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria only has one refinery.
With the ridiculously cheap price of diesel at just 40 euro-cents a liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", who rigged the pipeline network through Ogoniland: According to experts, at least 16 million liters of oil a day are leaking through the entire Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the temporary raw material stored is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, which also include politicians and high military officials, keep the best part in crates and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is due to population management or lax production methods to be purely academic.
"If oil companies had not behaved like invaders and completely destroyed the natural habitat of fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries".
While the Ogoni conditions are being torn apart by Shell to the point that only one deduction from the consortium appears: "Maybe it is better to present another nationality, like Chinese".
Michael is getting nervous.
"It's time for you to disappear", says the muscular Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come any minute".
If the army's special unit catches the illegal refiners, they don't threaten to arrest them, but with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to profit from the raw material.
"This damned invention has completely torn our country apart", says Akpobari.
Investigators detect dangerous manufacturing defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a major safety problem.
In an investigation of a crash landing, researchers found a possible manufacturing defect that can cause "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers on the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were far more fortunate than you might imagine: Australian aviation safety authorities have detected a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s, and have warned of a possible manufacturing defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report published Thursday.
This could have caused "catastrophic engine failure".
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus which had to make a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline has launched legal proceedings against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in federal court in Sydney, allowing further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline will seek compensation for the incident in early November.
The engine's marked for missing parts and its wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will conduct further safety tests on superjumpers equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesman for ATSB.
The security issue has become important enough to inform everyone concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet grounded for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded approximately three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa re-engineered an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-decker plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada across the country causes traffic chaos
Germany in full white: Almost all over the country it snowed overnight.
Many streets are in chaos, trains and planes are failing.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Freezing temperatures reached almost the entire country on Thursday night, triggering traffic chaos in many places.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow cover of six inches [15 cm] thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the snow plows are running continuously, removing new snow over and over again, but it's not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects high tides with water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is a foot of fresh snow and strong, cold winds are driving it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there overnight.
In Saxony-Anhalt too, the police authorities reported major disorders on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to the German railway, major disturbances are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the tracks or broken catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the long-distance service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and rescue services provided wool blankets, food and drink to all 165 passengers on the train.
The snow-blowing winds sweep the streets.
At Germany's largest airport, snow-covered winds caused numerous flight cancellations.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The snow blowers are running continuously.
However, there are few stranded passengers at the airport, despite that there are 400 bunk beds prepared for them.
In many streets, there were already many accidents on Wednesday afternoon.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a crossroads in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg because of snow on the streets: Here too a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
A 30-year-old woman also died after flipping her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Weather forecasters have good news: The snow will become increasingly soft and dusty and will therefore swirl in gentle streaks.
But the wind will slow down.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong, fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to minus 15 degrees.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank wants to part with its symbol: According to one article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank rearranged its headquarters: The twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district were modernized; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium is apparently trying to profit from the renovation costs and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland claims, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman does not name the reasons for the proposed sale.
"We always check whether it is convenient to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again", he said.
The largest German credit institution is therefore resigning from its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from an investor in a housing fund and then made the necessary arrangements.
Energy reforms amounted to some EUR 200 million.
A sale would be a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the newspaper towers, known as 'Greentowers', at around EUR 500 million.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold to a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed at this time, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were presumed dead after many explosions at a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, as security measures remain precarious at the scene of the disaster.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced to the scene of the disaster, but found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue team was able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts concluded that there was no chance the miners would have survived.
No bodies have been recovered to date.
Today, relatives and friends commemorate the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people have been changed by the radiant sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, underneath clothing and surfboards.
Flags waved at half-mast in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth", John Key, the head of the New Zealand government, told the participants in the memorial service.
"But they never came home".
She cannot accept her son's death until she has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Alongside the government president and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
The first explosion on 19 November also buried British and South African miners.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
As soon as the explosive gases are removed, the searing temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warrior!
Does gore fit into the arthouse?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is once again exploring the boundaries of the genre with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and murders his enemies with almost superhuman fights, sounds ideal for young viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and rip his enemies' guts out of their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as he is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters are carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of painful death screams.
Otherwise they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain scenery of Scotland, which the backdrop offers to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown-up filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients it's a shame they can't be mutually excluded.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy about the hairy drug dealer "Pusher" to be a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with anything more mainstream humor or anything less art house brutality.
A brain mass and a few budding guts can't deter most fans of arthouse cinema.
Most action fans are bored to death if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for understandable reasons and gets stuck in the calm and fog for an eternity before his team reaches America and goes quiet again.
It's a shame that "Walhalla Rising" hasn't found a cinema distributor in Germany and is only being released on DVD.
It is a calamity for magnificent images, but also because behind the bloody, presumptuous facade is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, it's all atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn condones himself just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy soundtrack of trance make a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters comes towards him.
Only a little blond boy, who supports Unojo faithfully, retains something of innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any moment a warrior from hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents perdition, but maybe only to those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mystery movie that you can hate and admire, to get angry and upset and surprised.
It's an experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this matter until checks are allowed.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the Euphrates River; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
His name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it's about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with North Korea's help in the cube, hidden in a valley that rises out of the river.
According to information from the US CIA's international intelligence service at the end of April 2008, a current reactor was designed under the name of the proximity of el-Kibar very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
The technique, however, is hardly useful for any purpose other than the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite imagery.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a scaled down copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from inside.
The reactor had only recently been up and running, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it's barely more well known than it was then, the enigmas getting bigger with time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely sure that the Syrians had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but saw little evidence of a "nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA presentation "plausible".
They're lacking solid evidence, as is the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of it, a senior UN diplomat responded in the summer that the IAEA has "enough material to have questions".
The Syrians quickly cleared the rubble of the alleged "useless military building" and raided the site on purpose.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by humans.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, of commercial vendors in the moments immediately following the attack, which must have greater informational value than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That's why the IAEA can't independently verify their authenticity.
Syria has always implied that it never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after analysis of the particles.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss it, as it has with regard to satellite images.
In addition, controllers are prohibited from a second inspection in el-Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel too is strictly silent.
"We will never comment on it", Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "is gradually becoming a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat corresponds with a place at the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, overseen by the IAEA, is pending.
The IAEA considers three more teams as key to progress in the clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not made public until now which teams are involved, what functions they perform, or whether they look suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as interned, again derived from the proximity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these sites and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf from satellite imagery, which is most likely one of the suspected objects.
Possibly located on or immediately adjacent to a military base, Syria bans entry to all three sites to the IAEA on this basis.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear a search that the US has requested from the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment thanks to warnings from the U.S. Secret Service.
Using satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is moving between the three sites and the bucket on the Euphrates bank.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna claimed that at least one of the equipment may be "related to fuel production".
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities", neither of uranium enrichment nor of reprocessing - processes that are necessary for building nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is run on unenriched uranium.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium for bombs should be separated later, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
Nor is there any doubt that the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are in all three places.
Since hundreds of truckloads of debris have disappeared from the ground, no one has any information on where the debris remains.
The OIAE considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, unlikely, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste zone.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the images from orbit show that the Syrians carried out land movements in the three suspected sites and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be coincidence, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent some months developing a plan of inspections there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the extent of the inspectors' interest.
Meanwhile, Damascus is also criticizing this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a sort of US ambassador, has been using so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who is supposed to propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but is still hesitant.
This path is very risky: it requires a majority of the IAEA governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected, "What if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in Wartime
There's been trouble since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the direction of her as-yet-unnamed debut.
She herself wrote the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much else is known about it, but this is enough to stir up a stir.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's associations have quickly protested, with the last minute move of some days of filming planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, she told a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She's not diplomatic. Weeks ago, the women offered her a meeting in Hungary, which she turned down.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no rape rape love stories, and Jolie's stance on this gives the victims enough on the script.
Her organisation in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended that Jolie be removed as ambassador, reports The Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture who read the script, granted after a strip and loosens a filming permit in Sarajevo, it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go in spite of everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she is very much involved in the Yugoslav conflict, she wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all parties involved.
Its content remains imprecise.
A second synopsis of the film is circulating online that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the war started and they meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the "rape victim falls in love with torturer" variant.
It's safe to say Jolie's movie really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie claims, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
They can now make peace with Hollywood hackers: while the script remains on the net illegally, like many others before it.
Nothing like far away from here
Tonight's finally getting good for the Irish again.
No sign of distress
Instead, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans shout for joy as loud music rumbles, feet hitting the ground.
The Bailey Club vibrates in southern Cork, because players throw, and find, ping-pong balls into beer glasses from a distance of ten feet.
The bizarre show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a plane ticket to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this bizarre drinking game and the low-key computer really don't make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with it, distract himself from the question of what the future holds.
Fun in Vegas is not on his agenda. In January, he'll be doing a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling", he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there".
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "he suddenly got his dream job as an event manager, maybe that's a good sign", he says with a smile.
Due to the poor prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought their fortunes abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT consultant in London.
The young people are leaving: there are many families like the Tanners on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predict economists and social research institute ESRI Dublin.
By 2015 there are 200,000 emigrants.
A great loss for this small country of only 4.5 million people.
The forecasts are confirmed, a migratory wave is coming comparable to the one that the island suffered in the eighties.
After a decade of progress that brought great prosperity to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly confusing for the young, well-educated Irish, for whom everything has been upside down so far.
Job losses and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of every ten men and women under 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the headmaster from a mass of young immigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything is sinking".
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, leaves and loses our country and with it an entire generation".
"Last one to close the door".
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a bleak future because the government is only making up and no longer offers young people prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategies to get new jobs", says the 20-year-old.
Watch as your peers go from one unreported practice to the next.
His biggest worry, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing".
People like Stephen McLarnon try to look at this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who are just starting out, working abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to steering their career", says the manager.
On their website, they have pictures of a boy surfing in Australia and another boy snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like working in a galley, but it brings freedom and fun.
For the past six months, Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something elsewhere.
With nothing left for the 29-year-old engineer to do, he now works with 15 Irish construction colleagues in Germany.
Now they're opening a fashion shop in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan only sees his homeland very rarely because he works overtime to pay off a mortgage on his house in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy", he says, since it's been a long time since he first stepped foot on his doorstep.
"I'm earning money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I've never been so comfortable".
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes to icy rooms.
The little house is in an elegant residential area with well-kept gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, easy money without a lot of questions", he says.
Are you afraid of failing on credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, serves more hot tea, and says, "I have no children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start over".
The civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he hears often these days.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as in past times here on the island", he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps it makes us feel Irish for the first time".
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple".
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
To leave the future hanging and just see what life is like somewhere else.
He's worked in London for a couple of years now, so why wouldn't he and his girlfriend do well in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that is worrying him most: celebrating his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid it might degenerate into a going-away party.
"Just not too much emotion", he says and takes a big sip of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds very distressing".
"We'd better call it a walk-away party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games".
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it allows the monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively humor that prevails in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a sharp decline in production last year.
However, only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which is lower than the regional average (see Chart 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy operates in practice in their country, the same as last year but considerably higher than the 25% recorded in 2001 (Graph 3).
Some 34% said they trusted their country's Congress and 45% their government, the same number as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has persisted during the global financial crisis is probably because many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32 percent.)
However, mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
Such feelings are less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents in Latin America cite crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Chart 5).
About 31 percent say that they or a close relative has been a victim of crime in the past year, a drop from 38 percent last year and the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared with only 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same way (and 80% support private companies), even though their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that exercises the greatest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (vs. 18% last year), followed by the United States (vs. 9% last year) and Venezuela (vs. 9% a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds that title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the garbage
No one expected the general elections held on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
However, it was far worse than foreigners who are trying to help the country recover from its problems feared.
Votes were introduced at the polls, some people voted multiple times, ballots were thrown in the sewers, polling stations destroyed and acts of intimidation.
The polling stations opened hours late.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the area trying to figure out where they were supposed to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the election to be called off.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, declared that the elections were "relatively good in many ways".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show must go on.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The draw is expected to take place in January.
The hope for the elections is not yet lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition calling for the vote to be invalidated.
But problems may still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who barely has support, if any, has passed to the second round.
With the cholera epidemic sweeping the country and more than a million earthquake survivors still living in tents, a large abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but were unable to do so due to a lack of organization.
Some 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the election of a popular and legitimate government to be an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it turns out, so do the Haitians themselves.
Moving tip-to-center
In the weeks since losing her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great deal of public sympathy that has increased her popularity rating by 20 points, to over 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Despite everything, whether she can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in the elections next year will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And at this point, the evidence is inconclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, was in the habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the additional income at their discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernandez's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death from a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have confronted Mrs Fernandez.
However, after a chaotic session in which one MP punched another in the face and other MPs accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue", said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore be implemented next year, giving the President even more leeway in spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it will probably grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the trade unions, place it at around 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and had the INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now moderate these policies?
He's called for meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by high prices of Argentine agricultural exports to the world.
However, inflation has limited the growth momentum achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernandez is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial links with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a prior forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not repaid in 2001.
It seems that Mrs Fernandez is now about to conclude an agreement with the creditors of the governments of the Paris Club, to which she owes some 6.7 billion dollars.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new index of national consumption prices, which seems to be the prelude to the cleanup of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernández wants to continue in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of whom have grown tired of Kirchnerism.
When Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have faded.
If she wants to win another election, she'll have to decide whether or not to quietly repudiate many of her husband's policies.
Half a cheer for China
Taiwanese voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible voters, turned out on November 27 to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what seems to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a champion of sentiments for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade agreement, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but by a short shot.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to secure a majority of the vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has leaned towards full independence from Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% for the KMT.
If it had been the presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied the KMT in the town halls.
The election featured typical Taiwanese election elements, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with flags and lightly dressed girls dancing.
Nor was the mysterious rigorous assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding and killing a passerby.
The funny thing is, it's not clear if the man intended to hurt Lien or get back at the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the election, sowing suspicion about the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the continent itself was not involved.
Instead, the candidates talked about plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests China's military threat.
As a result, the KMT usually avoids publicizing its ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time too the PPD avoided encouraging anti-China sentiment.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma said that his policy towards China was confirmed to be acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The government of Beijing is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
I am sure that you would like to see political integration as well, but first things first.
The best thing to do is wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was in a bad situation: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he openly advocated explicit independence.
However, under Ms Tsai's leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as the DPP's presidential candidate, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything it can to prove that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Ms Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he claimed that the DPP candidates would have fared better if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the PPD will have a hard time choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT must also make an examination of conscience.
Mr. Ma's ratings have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be primarily due to unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman claims that he will restructure his cabinet as well as local teams.
The large samples of the DPP suggest that Taiwan's support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed".
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Breakthrough Artist.
Act on a president's request and people will probably notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, was one of the Grammys surprises this year with a high-profile nomination in the Best New Artist category.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination is thought-provoking, but respects Grammy rules that require an artist to have released no more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was certainly a breakthrough and, given her light and pleasant vocal style as well as a great skill with pop, funk and Latin rhythm influences, one can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and the road to success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent to the Grammy voters, who have lately concentrated on the jazz realm for this category.
In the other categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent record that was a favorite last year.
Among Iyer's competitors are veteran saxophonist James Moody on "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley on "Positootly".
Trombone Shorty, a favorite New Orleans stringer and regular guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which otherwise leans considerably toward fusion as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James's wild punk Argue's Secret Society gained well-deserved recognition in the big band category, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for best direction of classical albums
The classical music nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, in five movements, and Steve Mackey for "Dreamhouse", an eclectic three-movement orchestral work.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
The classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories that include orchestral, opera, choral and solo albums.
The classical producer of the year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" by the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan for "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, approximately 30 minutes long, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin player Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa", Dorman stated in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the category of orchestral function, for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists nominated are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees for vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Proposed mosque in Temecula gets approval from the planning commission
The mosque project for Temecula has won unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often heated public testimony.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and traffic jams.
However, the committee members decided Wednesday night that the new religious center would be aesthetically impressive and comply with local law.
"Many good people came to show their support, whether Christians or Jews or Baha'is, of all religions", Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of the Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud of you".
"It shows that justice prevails".
"The opposition is really minimal", he adds.
"Only they talk too loud".
"There are wonderful people in this valley".
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted virtually until midnight; most of the time was spent with people speaking out for or against the center, roughly the same number on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"America no longer exists", one of the comments read.
"It's another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand".
"America has fallen".
The plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near ground zero, the area of New York where the September 11, 2011 attacks took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living smoothly in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a larger, better space than the warehouse they rented on a property they shared with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy a 4.32 acre lot on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it proves that it's possible for life forms to exist without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity".
"It can grow on either phosphorus or arsenic".
"That makes it very peculiar, but it is close to being a truly 'alien' type of life", said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in Thursday's online edition of Science.
For a long time, six major elements were considered essential for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible", said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss the discovery, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated a lot of speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "does show is that in other planetary environments, there may be organisms that use other elements to drive their biochemistry and that the set of 'standard' elements we think are indispensable for life may not be as fixed", said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure", Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could substitute one for the other.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus".
"As a result, it may be difficult for organisms to differentiate them".
"However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, so to speak, it cripples the biochemical machinery", Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt to and use to grow.
The microbe grows best with phosphorus, but the fact that it can be shown to live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that there may be a life form that uses arsenic naturally, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of replacing arsenic with phosphorus is not new, but no example of it ever being found.
Arsenic was more common in the earliest ages of the Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"It does suggest that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life formed on Earth in the old days", said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy, and the National Institutes of Health.
The stolen dogs that were missing in Compton have been found.
The two missing dogs from the four stolen dogs have been found outside the Bellflower Motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's officials said Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgi, went missing Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express pickup truck they were spending the night in in front of Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found late Wednesday night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine", Whitmore said.
"They are in good condition".
"They've returned to their rightful owners".
Whitmore would not specify exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is underway".
"We don't want to say anything", Whitmore said.
"We're following up on some leads".
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found for comment Thursday.
They met their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Deputy found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek were planning to show at the area competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing as of Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to showcase Trace.
The other dogs were to be exhibited in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's nearly two-month dog-racing tour.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park their van right outside their bedroom window.
They were carrying three other dogs (a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room).
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a thick coat and they'd be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen Tuesday morning at 6:00 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday it wasn't clear if a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again as MGM's restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the plan "pre-armed" by creditors to write off about $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and releasing movies and TV shows.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles to MGM relaunching under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executives of what will be a small studio.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million loan facility to finance the operations and production of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide management advice necessary to order its finances, while it struggled to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron Chairman and bankruptcy recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial troubles and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors, took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that the creditors were seeking.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal debate and disagreement, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper's companies will receive multi-billion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for their company management services, will receive a $4 million "success fee".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year and has assembled an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to take out a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep its gift budget in balance.
While the iPad is the leading contender to be the most wonderful toy of this year, followed, perhaps, by the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law had been working; this year's tech toy will probably have more power, cost the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the more well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offerings.
And button-battery-powered toys are on the rise, as are rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for ages 3 and up) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when their bellies are squeezed.
One squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze starts to put together a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Borrowing from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-shifting games like Simon Says, and can do the moonwalk, thanks to its innovative articulated feet with locking wheels.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you're a kid in the '80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and up), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correcting exercise book occurring.
If you are reluctant to give your child your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, 3-8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3-12 years), it is the first major tweak of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, 3-7 years) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows viewing family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a game of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to put words together by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out; it's formidable for an impromptu word-building competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based on their presence in toy stores alone, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, ages 6 to 12) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits at the Penguin Club store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the pig in your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the latest in a line of button-battery-powered microrobots.
The fake bug moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of law enforcement in China is being promoted
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin made his way into a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan, China's stocky urban police, feared and despised for their capricious forceful measures and their penchant for violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of onlookers.
"Firmly!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls who barely made it through their teens in white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to get attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with blue and white striped bowls.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance", said Mr. Tang, disdainfully.
"The models are cute".
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China's city inspectors.
A city ordered that all new recruits have a bachelor's degree.
Guangdong Province changed the grayish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating looks: In 2009, according to one report, 50 officers surrounded a wayward snack cart, and watched it frown constantly for half an hour, until the street vendor packed up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough cop a softer, more feminine side.
Sadly, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's meager respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei Province beat a passerby to death after he used his cell phone to film them dispersing a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and posted online, describing how to effectively whip offenders without causing them to bleed.
This year, a watermelon street vendor in Shanghai suffered brain damage after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar on the government", lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for "a really thorough cleanup".
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district asked for eight new female recruits through a notice in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's notice called for female candidates, ages 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They must have been above average height, over five feet, two and a half inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said the work was too physically demanding for women over 25.
"Your image is the important thing", an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc".
Then comes temperament "and the qualities within".
Female chengguan are like florists, he said, adding, "in addition to being florists, they will have other responsibilities".
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district's city administration office, is not eager to endorse that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job ads for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If that means being handsome, it's a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the handicapped or disfigured should not show up.
"We cannot allow a lame person or a hunchback to come to work here", Mr. Zheng said.
"Your image would not be good".
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his red cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her looks is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a sardonic look.
His dimple colleague, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said, "Our work should present the image of the city".
They also don't object to their time-bound work, they said, because they harbor career ambitions greater than simply chasing salespeople off the alleys where they're supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squad faces about a dozen street vendors who launch themselves on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many buns or bowls of tofu as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave".
"We've told you many times!" said Ms. Xu as a vendor fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle cart with noodle trimmings.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is pretty much the same thing every day", said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his spare time.
"Very routine".
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from vendors.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after a false rumor spread that Chengguan officers had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the nighttime incident; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where the female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a shop, as required by regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle was screaming roughly.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the bad-faced officers elbowed their way to their vehicles and quickly drove off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men's squad, remained behind, his white badge turned upside down to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men 40 and over, play a purely supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain a stylish image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally".
"Sometimes we fight physically", Mr. Li said with total naturalness.
"Most of the time it's the audience who starts the fight".
Prosecutors will not press charges against Senator Ensign.
The senator's lawyers announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have exonerated Senator John Ensign of criminal charges stemming from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work by lobbying for the woman's husband.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair made national headlines last year and hurt his career.
Ensign's office said it was "surely pleased" by the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign's attorneys said the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of its investigation and that it has no plans to bring charges against him on this matter".
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, email and other documents first leaked in October 2009 in The New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, obtain lucrative work through lobbying, to silence Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton work and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign's aide, he was barred by law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared to be at odds with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections for personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute", said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients under investigation by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared wary of accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks to its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens amid charges of procedural misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them", he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him the department did not want to press charges against his client.
Ensign's defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we think they made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to reverse an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said they didn't have enough evidence to prove the money was nothing more than a gift.
Energy NV is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, which got a job through lobbying thanks to Ensign's help with Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him he was "crushing" the Home Office over a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after it had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news first broke of the affair last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, she said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the lead of the Justice Department and conclude its investigation.
"Senator Ensign is eager to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada", he said.
Cheshire's appeal will be directed at Twitter.
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the courtroom rows.
Minute by minute, reports of the horrific testimony were being sent out via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter posts about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of murdering three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, is set to reach an official conclusion, with the judge's imposition of the death penalty voted on by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have filed court papers outlining the arguments for appeals that will likely occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reporting on the trial, including the extensive use of Twitter by media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere", and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appellate judges to grapple with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"From what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to a fair trial", said Thomas J. Ullmann, lead counsel for Mr. Hayes's defense.
Trial Judge Jon C. Blue of the State Supreme Court laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying that the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But it's probably not going to be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that coverage of high-profile cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in the case Sheppard v. Maxwell, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" because of the media.
The crime was believed to have been inspired by the TV show and movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appellate courts that reviewed Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the way communication from courtrooms is done, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is general concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile lawsuits, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms might make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes' lawyers, which will likely be debated for years, delaying an execution.
Defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Hayes may have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them creepy crime scene photographs during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they'll also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wrongly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had wrongly pushed for a verdict over his bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors weren't kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of intense coverage of the process may attract most interest.
They noted in a recusal to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually added fuel to the fire of emotion over the case.
"The daily congestion of tweets from the media, cameras and reporters outside the courthouse", the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps in the entire state".
His attention to Twitter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly, was a Luddite view that would make the court's policy on control of coverage weak in future trials.
But some lawyers said that appeals courts were often drawn to arguments about the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their letter, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, overturning Dr. Sheppard's conviction due to the coverage of the trial, and made clear that they would demand that new media require new rules.
"This case", they wrote, "represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell case of the 21st century".
Can civility build a bridge to bridge the divides?
After a remarkable campaign of invective and negativity, a little civility has been unleashed in Washington this week.
Is this a harbinger of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan fighting in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what everyone says, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another empty episode to gain partisan points.
Wednesday's public meeting of the chairman's deficit committee was equally civilised, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still separates the members.
That is hardly enough to declare a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a testing period, probing each other for signs of cooperation and compromise, as they try to gauge the limits of public opinion and voters' patience for a renewed partisan war.
That's why the meeting on Tuesday and subsequent evaluations by the participants were made with minimal demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deeply rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, expenses, health care or welfare, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There's no question that things have changed with regard to the way things are said", said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They're inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which then fade away.
That's good".
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda for the outgoing session, the Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are due at the end of the year, and nobody's in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a compromise to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans cannot make it seem that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is increased optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it was very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement would begin.
"After the things that need to be done are done, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to one of confrontation", he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civicism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012", he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of overstating their position, they know they must try to fulfill their promises to cut state spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit committee's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes and the retirement age, and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own estimation, have forced the deficit issue onto the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they've been struggling to get anywhere near that number.
The greatest resistance is among elected officials on the panel, suggesting that in tax matters there is, at least currently, little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans in the White House and those in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would bring about change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as it did in 1995, then both parties will watch the reaction of the people closely.
Anyone who considers themselves losing will probably change course and seek compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are higher today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as merely the prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven for corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy", and it leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects directly to the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority", takes its toll as money climbs the ladder.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and it blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a purge since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian TV channel about a documentary that suggested he was corrupt, he stated: "It's crazy, it's bullshit, it's annoying".
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government to crime have led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' and to claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government", the note states.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a mafia and criminal term that literally means 'roof' or protection) that goes through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow".
"Luzhkov is at the top".
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level".
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level".
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services".
The report claims that the SFS collects money from the larger companies, and that the police target the smaller shops.
One source, the report stated, "explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than from organized crime groups) since they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law".
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority".
The note notes that while the money collection is complete, protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed for one reason or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has admitted that little progress has been made.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats", Georgy Satarov, head of the Indem think tank in Moscow, said in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy".
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia".
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
On a national scale, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the nongovernmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the US Embassy note, which didn't happen until late at night Moscow time, will surely cause displeasure within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is fixing the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents might be lies and reacted angrily to a revelation that claimed U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policies in this country", he said.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would be done in such an immoral manner".
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School remembered the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader and cared about his people", said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook here that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a joint UN-Cambodian court issued the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can't do anything", said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil".
"This is creating divisions within families".
During the Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-led government, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the longest-serving Khmer Rouge fighters have fallen into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many are nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their arms, the soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have gained little after the surrender", said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the regime's utopian agrarian ideology".
"They were raised without any concept of doing business".
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before devoting herself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was good", he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone".
"But now life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves".
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concern here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the main leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases beyond those four.
This didn't do much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are thought to have died.
On a recent humiliating afternoon, Im Chaem returned home from working in the fields on wooden piles on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She said that if the court summoned her she would not appear.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable", he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned of instability if the court prosecutes more suspects, although experts and historians question this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past", he said.
But facing the past is precisely what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to the Khmer, is putting the broken pieces back together", he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand".
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", 75 pages long.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court", he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people the court will prosecute".
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too much weed and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the side of the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray for him", she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day she decided to walk to Pol Pot's final resting place, where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the US government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a pair of classified operations were conducted with Belarus over the past two months to remove 84.82 kg of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was apparently a good achievement to secure the former Soviet republic's invitation to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit".
"This shows that this process is working", said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the agreement was "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material around the world over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did under the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-grade uranium) and low-enriched uranium", Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone".
"We use it for research purposes, that's all".
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials claimed that the first task of removing the uranium from Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done in an airplane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the research facility with low-enriched uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official who works on Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen the trust" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will seek to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential de-escalation.
It was stated that 'while welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens.'
The Spanish government has no objections to CIA flights.
The Spanish government has no objections to the CIA flights carrying Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantánamo through Spanish territory, the US ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft that cross Spain".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting took place between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to intelligence flights through Spanish territory".
"They simply want to be informed" to avoid being "caught unawares", Aguirre reports in a cable.
Also the then head of Exterior, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Ejecutive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge's initiative to ask for the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements or sensitive information", the Embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concern over the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors", rather than the declassified information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between Governments", laments Aguirre.
In March 2007 at a lunch between the US ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although the Spanish judges are furiously jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid inflamed rhetorical comments, in an attempt to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored actions by the US that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US government", he notes.
The confessed parricide complained in the network of the "agony" of being a mother
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernandez is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which she used from a young age, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the Coruña town from which she comes.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructed through testimonies of their relatives.
The 30-year-old Galician started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left, it was soon known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get the DNA test.
It didn't take long for him to meet another girlfriend.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, you can see that their romance was fractured, that they broke up.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and musky, because I have come to work".
"When I told her, she thought it was okay, but of course, now she realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not be free to do what she wants".
Then he tells of a text message he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child".
She complains: "If you don't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back", she claims.
In May, he talks about returning to his village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only be there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to present myself for a job so as not to lose it".
She explains that if all goes well, she'll take her firstborn.
"He'll be with whoever he ought to be, that is, with me, and I'll never in my life think of leaving him again with anyone but my mother", a dubious intention given his bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, is presumed dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but not on the other".
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand, he's going to class almost every day".
He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll go there for some summer classes, and I'll save myself some kangaroo dough".
The 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming".
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to fuck".
The 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan".
Victor, his current partner, has one: "He advances me money".

Monica entered yesterday the provincial penitentiary of Palma, from the center of judicial detainees of Menorca.
The lawyer of the case, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, "nor had any intention of causing harm to the minor".
Before, he did confess that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and placed his body in a suitcase.

The Popular Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and experienced deputies in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP has already set its sights on the general elections because, whether it has advanced or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes this formation obtains in those elections is usually double that it receives in the Catalan ones.
Thus, the popular Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the autonomous elections of 2006, the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend continues, which has been fueled by a shift in PSC votes and the PP's electorate's loyalty, analysts have calculated that if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also gain four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose one deputy - now it has three - while ICV would keep one deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in his relay at the head of the Diputación de Barcelona, one of the administrations that more budget manages - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and popular agree that the PSC could lose Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get a majority or have the chance to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this group to lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council - 5% of the votes are needed.
The PP has increased its vote in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced they can lead the overturn in the tarraconese capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has only 500 votes behind the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda.
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, three were arrested in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the Police Information Directorate in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to different al Qaeda groups, including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and Laskar e Taiba (Let), the latter of the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 106 people.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of assuring that with the "Operation Kampai" the Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus at international level has been "weakened" and, "therefore, its operational capacity".
The researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "combatants" can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operating in Europe, which is why, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units have participated in the investigations, so it is not excluded that in the EU territory similar coups will be carried out in the coming days as developed in the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was carried out in Thailand with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who led the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists that met the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of males between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigation media stress that, at the moment, no data has been found linking the arrested in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it is worth remembering that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "commando" that ended the life of 106 people.
The police have seized a lot of documentation.
PP demands Mas to park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that are summed up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and to do without filo-sovereignist adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to pose on the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalanes went to the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that he has obtained 18 deputies in the elections of last Sunday, a figure more than enough to make himself wanted, because the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain in the vote of investiture.
A possible agreement with the PP will determine the future alliances the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but for now, the talks Mas is having with other political leaders are in Catalan.
And as for the PP president, to support an investiture "all the sovereigntist and independentist discourses must be parked", as well as the economic concert - similar to the one in the Basque Country - that the converging leader even intends to submit to referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiation on Mas' investiture will be handled by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician claims the deaths weren't due to "lack of measures"
The owners of Olot Center do not rule out that their janitor killed more than 11 elderly people
The heads of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) held a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people while employed there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the center's lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility obliges us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible".
And it is that in addition to the social disrepute that can suffer the entity for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the celador, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that are already calculating the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric hospital - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased but that, according to the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was done by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, yesterday flatly denied this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures cannot have been at any time the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in the case there is not a single indication that there was any reckless action by anyone other than the accused himself".
The man, who is now known as "The Angel of Death", confessed to 11 murders the day before yesterday and said that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009, and that a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused the death by overdosing on insulin, unlike the first crime he committed using a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to medicines.
Insulin injections and a sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine murders that the nurse, in his eagerness to relieve the inmates' suffering, used to kill them.
But it will be the analysis being done in the lab that will have to clarify whether Vila is not lying and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed he did with the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the cellist, nor even to the number of murders confessed, which do not rule out that it is higher, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having successfully committed eight murders.
That's why they say they're putting themselves at the disposal of justice to clarify the extent of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that warned "the markets must not underestimate our ability to react".
The peripheral spreads have closed sharply and European bank shares have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely recovered, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that just as it collapses, it recovers but is motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
It'll take the institutional investor a while to lose his fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded that the government debt purchase plan be terminated as ineffective and that all extraordinary liquidity measures be removed and only unlimited access be allowed per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures 'at least until March' and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond buying programme and even signal to step up.
If they do not live up to the expectations they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to obsess about withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
Just like at their May meeting when they said they hadn't even considered buying bonds and the markets collapsed, tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, he announced the bazuca on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market crash.
Yesterday the one-year-old letter auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million at 5.28%, versus 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points over the whole curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment following Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland holes figures have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15 billion potential and they have until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Support Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the quality of the information it provides.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension ahead of the next Heads of State and Government Summit on 14 December, at which a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and that we all play the same music.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the gift of opportunity when he presented yesterday the plan of measures to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment ring in the ears of investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains why the Spanish stock market has risen by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will resolve with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a relief plan would be self-immolation.
They'd give us a line of cash that we don't need, Treasury has over 40 billion in cash available, triple what it had in March, at very high rates and it closes you off from the markets.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being, seeming to be".
Come on, we can do this.
The president of Eulen will challenge the Vega Sicilia board requested by his sons
The storm is not easing the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "null of full rights", the judicial junta of El Enebro on the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to make their majority and take over the management bodies of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Maria José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation over control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services to the company does not seem willing to give in to his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
He was removed from the board of directors by five of his seven sons who were appointed as directors at the shareholders' meeting on January 18 this year and whose challenge is noted in the Commercial Register.
The judicial junta of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of Mercantil No. 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunder in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to set the meeting is, until the dispute is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal by the applicants their five children to, through procedural argucia, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of right, try to validate and sanitize the radically null junta of January 18", according to their official spokesmen.
This argumentation will be the basis for the Board to challenge it once the meeting has been held, as it is 'not valid in its entirety'.
The same protagonists, who keep a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, the holding company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's seven sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group claims, however, usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the question of substance which the judge must decide once the appeal has been heard, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software designs improvements to cars in real time.
Since Red Bull burst into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship everyone bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without belittling the driving skills of the eventual champion, Sebastian Vettel, nor the power of the Renault engine that powers his car, the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in Red Bull's hands to make it a winning team has become a legend in the world of Formula 1.
It is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from high-level automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly lines of manufacturing plants around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, simulate faithfully the product or process before building it in real life, thus avoiding failures and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during races and testing.
Russwurm explains that teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team now has 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and design all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all the elements of Red Bull's racing cars except the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be made from simulator to virtual reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser and high-tech autoclave production systems.
The only limitation to this madness of technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars that each Formula 1 team can spend at most each season to facilitate the competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its cars in a town about 30 miles from London.
These are two buildings that are restricted to visitors, especially journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this task is 580 people, including its two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula One, without a doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety is zero.
The factory's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it was safe to say that R&D advances in wagon cars accounted for 50 percent of victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have varied and technology accounts for 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15% of added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will set up 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in partnership with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of a network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will make this initiative compatible with the 16 areas already present in multimark centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice-president, Helena Herrero, gave an example of the remodeled store on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been working for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branded sales outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes all 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems said the philosophy for setting up the stores will always be the same, relying on a local dealer with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
HP also covers the training of staff in the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops intends to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, attention, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-leading pilot programme to solve potential problems with HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects you to a technical centre in Maastricht (the Netherlands).
"In this way, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that sometimes can take up to two days".
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services", Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bets on stealing a million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banco Sabadell's CEO, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war on liabilities.
The Commission has also taken a number of steps to improve the efficiency of the system.
Sabadell hopes to attract a million private clients in three years, his pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new three-year master plan in 2011.
The aim, apart from surviving without the need to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share by attracting a million new private customers - 700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted - its big outstanding subject, as until now it had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in the private sector is 3.5%, while in enterprises it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be presented by the bank when presenting the results of the financial year.
Few banks dare to set goals and make them public these days, as the financial crisis has upset all the plans of the world banking system.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its Optima director plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets made it extend one more year.
Customers who let their savings banks slip will be their primary target.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the war of the liabilities - which penalizes margins - is decreasing, the price of risk premiums that banks and savings banks are paying for their issuances to obtain liquidity are already moving to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it is going to be a pressure factor on credit".
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher", Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already gave orders to its network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of the differentials -see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend of banking now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says, in Spain "greater sizes will be required".
"Next year we're going to move everything", he said.
It states that capital needs are "high" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions may be in trouble.
The Commission notes that the FROB can supply the market in the collection of funds for new recapitalisations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he played down what some bankers are predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, which cushions the crisis.
ECSC rules out second wave of mergers in the box
The Commission's proposal to set up a European Investment Bank (EIB) is a step in the right direction.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks started, several entities said they would not participate in the first phase and would reserve for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Cajas of Avorros (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the majority of the mergers have been done, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be said to be a second round, what is there are adjustments".
"Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have been done and are being overseen by the Bank of Spain, which has also been very involved", he said.
In a statement at a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta said the process of concentration is being undertaken "as quickly as possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is happening in the timeframe that was set in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he stressed.
"Going from 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million in assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel", he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate opinions about the slow pace of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The ECSC Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who questioned it a "lack of knowledge".
The director pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes at the greatest speed possible".
It also recalled that the Spanish banking sector came out very well standing from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoe and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions in the markets have led to a twofold government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax cuts to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros of unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, vice-president Elena Salgado, with the support of former president Felipe González, has joined the criticism of chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How are these movements to be interpreted?
Go ahead, Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with the old traditions of many of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the currency area.
The second is the recovery of the framework, although it now seems like science fiction, with a very favourable opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third is a redesign of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines for countries that have failed, possible suspensions of payments for some of them and the extension of the costs of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government got out of hand a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a divergence between what Germany believed needed to be done (fiscal austerity plans and stability in public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully prolonged the rescue decision for Greece.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism at the time, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerged with a clear position, demanding reform of the Union's Treaties, to make it possible to save a country and at the same time force private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, albeit a little sweetened, has been approved and in the coming months we should be witnessing the process of reforming the Union to make those measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we have to take measures now that he may not agree with, by that date the old way of working of the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will mark the birth of a new monetary area, in which countries that break the rules will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare a suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is telling us that we must pursue a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, they simply will not tolerate.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand.
It is not just about bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they're asking us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these circumstances is to fool ourselves.
I hope the current turbulence will give way to a little more calm.
And let's take advantage of the window of opportunity that they've given us, until spring 2013.
President Zapatero seems to have understood this too and his twofold manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that order must be brought home has opened its way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't look like they're going to move it.
And among the possibilities under consideration, the possibility of leaving a currency area too crowded with unimportant countries cannot be excluded.
Then Germany can always tell us that it has already warned us.
Sports and law fraud
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but not willingness to escape a penalty.
The allegedly planned expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) from the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such behaviour is unsportsmanlike and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, with only a few minutes to go in the game (which their team had clearly won), the two players deliberately wasted time in making fouls to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will finish as group leaders, both players will meet the regulatory sanction in the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and can go through clean of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned the team's coach, Jose Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the ethos, the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate in the case is due to the fact that it was played by a team from the Real Madrid team (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and which in past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds another episode to his long history of being a histrionic and provocative coach.
In any case, the debate is about whether this type of behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the regulations, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions are a fraud of the law; indeed, they are actions that respect the rules of the sport, but they seem to elude their meaning.
The question is whether they are damaging the spirit of sport.
One of the assets of the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods that is referred to as fair play is to prevent the team of the offending players from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which also did not happen.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that they did not conform to what we normally characterise as cheating or law fraud, as their violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but precisely their action tried to be the most obvious to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders gain from the willful misconduct examined.
It seems necessary to note here that neither the opponent is put at a disadvantage nor is there any advantage in the same match, since the result of the action is obviously to leave the team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club won't be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team can be eliminated at the first of the change, and in addition with this action the players fulfill a penalty match and go to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, going round and round, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions are not against the spirit of sport, which is to make strategic decisions to make the most of what the rules allow.
In the case at hand, the players did not act to evade the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without escaping or escaping punishment.
Although the line between ingenuity and legal fraud is blurred, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the directive to provoke them was transmitted.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Bidding campaign to capture group Christmas dinners in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar is concentrating this year a flood of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
Self-funded celebrations by employees are proliferating, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the thunder and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise as an oxygen ball for the restaurant and leisure of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority of customers: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, agree the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed.
To make the accounting more complicated, this year's calendar (New Year's Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated requests on the week of December 13, with the result to date of a flurry of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and hardly any movement for the week before.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean cow era began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
In keeping with tradition, many workers pay out of pocket for their work.
Whatever the situation, both sides are demanding battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer's representative, as of today, does not dare to predict how the festivities will be this month.
"People think long and hard before they book".
"He wants to leave but he has the alerts on in the matter of prices", he points out.
The business will be good "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the fringe around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
A survey of several downtown establishments shows a collapse in requests for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group says there is a real boom in requests for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, which they have responded to by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more advance reservation, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done everything possible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros", they detail.
AN Grup, which is leaving El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locations, remains optimistic after detecting a boom in turnover since the second half and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate the holidays.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas one, with 30 euros or more as the star budget and the perception that there is a willingness to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that are re-inviting their employees and a sense that the volume of groups is somewhat larger.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Ocio of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, is confident of beginning to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that in general the reservations are "animated", although customers "negotiate to the maximum".
Of course, the celebration has not diminished, pay whoever pays, it indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program is a major concern in the United States.
Islamabad produces atomic weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
WikiLeaks leaks confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns in Washington about the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the illuminating and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and the thoughts of the US diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security, instead of increasing, is "declining", and that the unstable Asian country is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - that the weapons are not assembled but are stored in parts to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for alarm in Washington.
So says Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in a report prior to the visit of then-National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersal of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of transporting atomic materials".
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is seen, not only by the US but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep watch.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural standards, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work on nuclear or missile programs", Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with his US counterparts.
The most recent documentation leaked by Julian Assange's portal is the declining cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high pace of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, calling communication with Pakistan "frustrating", said: "Transparency is often lacking; offers of aid go unanswered or are dismissed".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistani army must end tacit support for terrorist groups".
To the hunt for the head of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a top counterterrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol is issuing a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it's hard to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track Assange's movements".
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It is not new, it dates from November 20.
And it's not about the latest leak of over a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents but about the sexual abuse allegations the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer for the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, says that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange".
It was on the 20th when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
As it stands, all 188 countries of Interpol have indications to identify or locate Assange "with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, the organization has explained, do consider the so-called red notice a free-way to proceed with an arrest - which must be undertaken by the national police force - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move has angered Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder has been willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, whom they compare to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
"This seems like a hunt, not a legal persecution", the letter says.
While the world searches for him - and his mother from Australia defends her son's innocence - Assange remains in the dark, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype from an undisclosed location, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering American diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the US has signed, he should resign", he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website", he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's attempt to play down Assange contrasts with the views these days proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the House Homeland Security Committee in January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks on the terrorist list "to intervene and fund and prosecute anyone who gives them any contribution or help".
Even further has gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying Assange should be "killed".
"Obama should target him and use a drone or something".
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind of a punishment", he declared on Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winking to Carod's allies
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and an end to the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to get through the enemth internal revolt in the ERC ranks, without a north by losing 11 deputies and half the votes.
The party president is aware that his amateur resignation is insufficient for the allies of ex-leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can absolutely cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
The leader of the Left will try to win over the new critics with winking that will allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC councillors will be able to pronounce on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by a raised hand.
If the carolists want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisal.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said that he would not consider it ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand that the president do more than put his office at the disposal of the militants, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the highest organ between congresses.
But since they don't have enough majorities to force resignations, they're gonna try to agree with the executive on a roadmap by May.
For this, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to move the congress forward to autumn 2011, something the top already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that "polyphony" harms stability and that its goal is to make the organization able to wash the dirty rags from doors in once and for all.
In this regard, the article that acting councillor Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered Puigcercós' ideologue, the head of Innovació took for granted that the leader will be re-affirmed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, two of which stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new faces from the sector akin to Carod.
The second one may be the big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC abolish assembly system as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it proposes a reform of the statutes that allows the congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
The end of the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of Puigcercós' team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the task to the management to revise the assembly system in a specific congress of reform of statutes.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years discouraged addressing the matter.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, it might be a good time to pick it up and try to shut it down for good.

On the woman's skin were found tattoos of the Santa Muerte, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the latter part of the month, the body of a man was found aboard a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet wounds and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a couple of men with their heads framed and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.

Next to him, the officers found a postcard with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and said he supports its offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its emission of greenhouse gases.
China is still committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, China's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said his country has made huge efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives but will continue to work together with the international community on this matter.
He said China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas progress has been made, including the approval last year of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set for reducing emissions of gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities, to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, there are numerous multiannual plans, both financed by the Chinese government and by governments in other countries, which are under way or have already been completed.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private sector.
A provincial project on climate change is also underway, another for the change of incandescent lamps by savers and another one of mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government's scientific adviser on climate change, said China's efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he said, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States they are 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and plans to do more by 2020, he said.
Attached to legality expulsion of Espino: Cesar Nava
The national leader of the PAN said the former Panist leader has the right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what suits his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was in accordance with the law and that the former panist leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what suits his right.
In an interview prior to the protest by Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonoran Order Commission".
"Mr. Espino has the right to go, in his case, via complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body", he noted.
He also clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that there has never been an alliance for the presidential candidacy at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Action Nacional will come out strengthened from the internal election on December 4 and 5, when its successor will be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was a approach for the local election that was successful and fulfilled the objective", he said.
The panist leader said the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, we enjoy it and it strengthens us", he said.
He said the council will certainly choose the best leader who requires National Action for the next three years, and will hand over the staff "to whoever the council determines".
"I have that absolute calm and openness, any of the five I would be proud to hand over the office of party chairman to".
He predicted that the rebound the party registered in the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the next contests, although "it is not time yet to think about 2012".
"For now, it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be up to the expectations".
When asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the four years of his government, César Nava called on the priists to reflect on the sexenios of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet", he said.
He said the head of the federal executive can make expressions like the one he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gagging and much less censorship.
Obama promotes law in favor of undocumented students on Twitter
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and instruct them to pass this legislation", the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the nationwide mobilization today in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and get them to pass this legislation", Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps an open cyber link to a broader document asking the public to contact the senators immediately, given the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected soon, now is the time to make your voice heard", he says.
The message was released after all 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by all 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other bills such as ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said once the fiscal issue is resolved, a calendar can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time"...
"We all agree that we have to settle the tax issue before the end of the year"...
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a "closing vote" on the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, though it's more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before age 16, have stayed in the country for the past five years, and entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the initiative, requiring the concurrence of a handful of Republicans, as pro-project organizations engage in intense lobbying to ensure the bill passes.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
So the Dream Act supporters are demanding that they add a few Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Maine senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have stated that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger in the wound
The second round of the language pleasures was a walk where the participants showed off their storytelling
"I understand El sexo en la lengua, but... the finger in the wound? what is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was invited to open the second round of Los placeres de la lengua, a series celebrating literature in Spanish and who this time used the subtitle of her question (at another fair the round table was dedicated to El sexo en la lengua, she explained).
The finger on the wound... "makes us in trouble", the Argentine writer spat softly to the audience, mostly young people, who met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "wound" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not get answers although she does get clues in the same narrative thread.
She comes out of the infectious disease clinic convinced: "patience is not my forte, maybe it's my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the trauma specialist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the hall, but who clarifies that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the open real and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very interspersed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story entitled "Elogio de la invención", where the finger in the wound is not named but in a moment is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, it tells of a famous witch, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turned to talk later America, the great novel that did not lack from the beginning its own chroniclers who told it and cited Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of what was told by the captains conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invented us all, mocked the faked witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told with imagination that lacked even modesty".
However, he stressed that "the crazy and the embusters are the ones who imagine best" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known which of the narrated belongs to one side or the other, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
He calls it the "Cervantine tradition".
"By his inheritance we are what we are counted".
In turn, the writer Mayra Montero applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the invitation of the FIL with its round table El dedo en la llaga.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed her finger at the great scourge of social violence that is sweeping her country - and Latin America - as a result of drug trafficking and drug sales.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated", he said, after citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and reader, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the committed writer of the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in the intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatism, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To be the owners of our thoughts and be the owners of reality we have to nuance: and nuance means many times to put the finger on the wound and disturb those people who are much more comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and disturb also the powers that prefer a world in black and white", he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series three times already.
With Santos Laguna and Monterrey facing each other in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach the deciding series three times already, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up consolating himself with the runner-up medal, he has been one step behind the winners and interestingly with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he was leading Morelia with which he fell by 4-2 overall against Toluca; later, in the Clausura 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with 3-1 overall and it was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén again suffered a setback, as his team finished tied 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he put himself in the lead by 3-1 with two chances to seal the title for finally three of his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the voltereta 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same fate, seeks to break free from the curse and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he says that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to come out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an aficionado that I owe and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important", commented the timonel when asked about the numbers he has against playing finals.
He has a very vigorous previous final, which, he says, he has learned a lot from, "the only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the final we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw we were ready to run and I think that is a lesson, until the match is not over we can celebrate".
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty shootouts, something that does not disturb him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the penalty shootout, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad play the fate, sometimes by the nerves or anxiety of having the title in our hands, but it went, that left us something for this final that we hope does not reach that instance".
Romano has in his hands to stop being a runner-up coach and to experience for the first time the glory that titles give.
US changes visa rules
You should go to the Visa Applicant Service before your interview at the Consular Section; the cost and waiting time will be less.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa process at the U.S. Embassy and Consulate will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service (ASC) before their interview at the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer needing to make a payment for the appointment, another payment for processing the visa application and another payment for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a one-off payment covering all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases with a request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for business and investor visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only have to go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
Because biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will stay in the Consular Section for less time than in the past.
Likewise, those who apply for visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of 26 dollars.

NASA will announce the discovery of alien life
The US space agency has called the press to present a finding tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery Thursday that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The find will be presented at a press conference tomorrow, Thursday, at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as the study of the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present "a finding that will impact the search for extraterrestrial life", prompting speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures just like us in hostile environments that were once thought uninhabitable, and it could put on the table the possibility that they could become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any life form, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our beneficial atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the true scope of the findings at a press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (Saturn's largest moon), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
The following are the main features of the new system:
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanship', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not being installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, led by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and all four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanship' in the Chamber.
Before the start of the 60th Legislature's installation session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, were 'thrashing' against the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it starts the 'bipartisanship', because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in their capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo, said that with these reforms institutionally constitutes the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He said in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, based on a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overwhelmed again by both parties and the opposition coalition is over.
"So far has it (the opposition coalition) come, that's what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, not even if they have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
He said that the Congress, after being monopoly, cannot be allowed to be "duopoly".
"It is not in the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipartisanship in Congress".
To start, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other colleagues to be more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from the PT, explained that the Congress has become a 'botin' between the two, alluding to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just one game, now they're splitting it up between two".
Patrón Montalvo, asked that the personality of the deputy be respected, that he be given his place at the negotiating tables.
"That not by cupular agreements, leave out 5 that probably we will make 9 deputies, now the five that see us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they did that they agreed, we are out and we are not in agreement with that reform".
$200,000 more for the supplier.
Pays Mazatlan City Council another check to the questioned owner of an electrical equipment company.
A cheque for a little over 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, the last cheque number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidación de cuentas por pagar".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this provider, which was observed by the State's Superior Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total still owed to him and, consequently, how many more checks are still to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, it is simply being paid what it is owed, just like the rest of the suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last one on 16 November.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official State Gazette, as the law indicates when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used its services again.
The above, after on July 25, Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the City to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos was paid by the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent to attend tourist sites
Tourist businessmen are mourning the accident of the foreign tourist due to poor conditions at the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell into a sink of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Commercials of the Golden Zone, recalled that in different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the bad condition of the streets and the banquets has affected because tourists come to walk around and see the mess and turn to nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it is to close a company and have no idea of the money that is lost, or else they wouldn't do the work in this way in such a short time and without proper planning".
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to take responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it as giving preventive maintenance and not falling solely into the corrective", he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, but as residents we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well".
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, for tourists to come, it's not just about promotion, it's about good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions", he said.
"It has not been given the proper attention and this kind of facts highlights something that is notorious to all, maintenance is needed".
Raúlera Llínez, undersecretary for Tourism Promotion, said rescuing Mazatlán's tourist sites is urgent because they are not being used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be put on line together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put on line to make them attractive to be able to add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination".
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that the deputies take on the great responsibility of being an example of a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A worthy work Legislature free of agreements between parties and the state Executive demands the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature has been installed, made up of seven political forces, 19 deputies from the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergence and one from the PVEM, totalling 40 popular representatives.
Among the expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that do not repeat the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Council Coordinator Empresarial, proposed that the newly released 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the deputies will really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because it is customary for them to make arrangements to look after their own interests and become carnival companions of the governors and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions".
He said they should certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to move the Governor in turn forward.
"We are concerned that they come to do a worthy job and above all committed to society and sectors because it was the Sinaloenses who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Tres Islas, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and sum up forces in search of economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they boost economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that in some way will encourage job creation".
As for tourism, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight he has within the state budget to strengthen the state Tourism Secretary.
"I understand it's the second Secretariat in the state with the least budget and it's incongruent as an important economic activity and a currency and investment generator and directly competes with the agro industry".
In addition, it requires labeling resources to tourism projects that are detonating and that help provide security to the state and update the Alcohol Law that have not been resolved in previous legislatures.
A wizard king is sought
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the upcoming Day of Kings will be difficult to fulfill their wishes, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in the Salvador Allende Colony and live on a daily basis because the father has no fixed job.
"Sometimes we see it hard because my husband has no chamba, but we sell mandarin and potatoes... in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street", said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the children.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests tailored clothing for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said 'let's go see son', because it was very expensive", recalled Cayetana sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is a size 12; Isaiah, 10, is a size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears a size 8.
Jose Juan, 14, is short of tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be a big help.
If you want to help make the dream of the Coronado Valenzuela family's children a reality you can participate in the Search for a Wizard King campaign by donating a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions were carried out in the context of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
The persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and production equipment have been seized", says Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec's Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of production of Cannabis, possession with intent to traffic, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have come about after a long investigation that has lasted for about a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests", Mr Ruel said.
The police operation involved about 70 officers from the Estrie Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department.
You can fight illegal immigration without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says should solve the problem of boatloads of illegal migrants, is sure to face strong opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter".
"I am here with a party that has created the granite you are treading on", declared liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow for up to a year of detention for anyone who comes from a vessel identified as carrying illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc de Québec, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
"We are against it and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the Government does", Mr Duceppe said.
NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow has flatly rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough on illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree that measures should be taken against those in charge of the clandestine migrant camps and that is what we are aiming for with another bill, Bill C-35", says Ms Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of one year", Ms. Chow explains.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country like a rag".
"They expect Canada to take firm action", says Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative told QMI that the Government was going to request a vote to allow each opposition MP to explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit fails to achieve unanimity
Despite the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the matter.
Public Safety Minister Robert Dutil supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation on this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Consequently, Tuesday's announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It is worth noting that during a meeting of the Permanent Council on the police services of Quebec held on 29 October this year, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of the Quebec party who deals with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as "a rabbit out of the chicken coop" and as "a chapucero solution of the last minute".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it", he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem".
For CSQ president Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest insists on preventing the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our view that he has something to hide", he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To break this deadlock, it suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the Auditor-General to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the interventionist general", he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could give the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus enabling him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent gang is not the only project in the making in the Charest government.
The Quebec government is also calling on Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to better adapt it to this type of crime.
This request seems to come from the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister for Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments in relation to this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to the biker gangs, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently pushed for the passage of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a precautionary measure, two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road went under.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions experienced heavy rainfall, ranging from 40 to 70 millimeters.
Also, 20 to 40 millimeters of additional rainfall is expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
As this rainfall adds to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain areas, several rivers are feared to overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers, at Saint-Jérôme in the Laurentides, and the Chêne in Lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon to overflow.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have washed away a temporary bridge.
As a precautionary measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In the Outaouais, overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit is still on alert and monitoring the situation closely, according to Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Center, meanwhile, issued announcements Wednesday announcing heavy flooding of several rivers, particularly the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
They blame Dupont in part.
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a setback at the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CCNR) over controversial statements about welfare and Haitians, as well as his rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his team at CHOI 98,1 FM were entitled to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in daytime broadcasts".
The Council has also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, do not infringe broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning comments made on broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Common Front of Quebec Social Assistance recipients.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters should report reliable and not misleading data.
In relation to the suicide, the accused, Stéphane Dupont, had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most of the Committee's members have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life's problems.
'The majority of the Committee considers that the disputed episodes of Dupont le Midi have dealt with a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate manner.'
Therefore, any blame in this respect has been dismissed.
The last dispute concerned statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had been the subject of a media confrontation that had aroused numerous reactions.
The CHOI host stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure if those in need would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive but that their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of the Haitian people.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there".
"My record has been clean for a year and a half", the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the use of vulgar language.
In any case, the radio station CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences for the broadcaster will be minimal, as the broadcaster must, inter alia, announce the decisions once during peak hours within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
Montreal native Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, climbs the tatami rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria", explained Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I look for fights everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the ground game that involves mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America".
The athlete, who works as a security guard and employee of UPS, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championships, held October 23-30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won in the full contact kickboxing and thai boxing categories", he explained.
"I'm currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China".
"They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category".
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth".
"In 2007, in China, I finished fifth in the tournament, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009", he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been improving in every competition".
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
San shou or sanda is a Chinese martial art in which you can hit with your fists and feet, as well as throw your opponent to the ground.
The matches were originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Even though Nacer Zemmal has only one competition left in his career, he will certainly attend the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Kung Fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the most famous and prestigious in China", explains the friendly boy.
"It's like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)".
"It's been an amazing experience".
Zemmal has won his first match, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"The one who won me over is a real professional", he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)".
"The winners of the semi-finals will face each other in the final of their category".
"Then, the champions of each category compete to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu".
450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth USD 450 million to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this flood of more than 100 contracts is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has been awarded the largest contract, the project management contract, for a total of 295 million, without a prior tender.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with the responsibility of managing this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the lucrative contract was awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium without a prior public tender.
The Quebec Party believes that the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and raise prices.
"It's a new method of collusion and eliminating competition".
"That is to say, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly", declared yesterday the deputy of the Quebec Party Sylvain Simard at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded this afternoon, firmly denying that there was any collusion with this contract.
"I am beginning to get tired", he protested, defending that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and "lacking rigor".
He pointed out that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
It is usually a time-bound alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is of a high level of complexity, given the scale of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any event, the contract was awarded without competition; it was a negotiated contract.
In addition, the consortium formula is no longer the exception to the rule in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir reported last week, the formula for consortia in the technical advisory sector is being investigated by the Government.
A quick glance at the Quebec trade register identifies more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
Dessau thus works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Geneva, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, Dessau.
As regards the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that 'the James Bay territory responds to a particular labour dynamic and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s'.
The major manager of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation which highlighted the fact that the project management contract was awarded directly.
"If you answer a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher".
"You have two options: you can contact the players in the sector and say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price".
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people", Mr Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than USD 50,000 obtained by the Parti québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir identified 109 technical advice contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not including its participation in Énergie gérance.
All the contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the contract of Energy Gerency of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has hinted that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Quebec Liberal Party".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is rather its leaders.
The Green label does not inspire confidence
More environmentally friendly, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer hardly trusts sustainable development actors, fair trade marks or eco-certificates to guide his choices.
The Commission has also taken a number of steps to ensure that the EU's energy policy is based on the principles of sustainable development and that the EU's energy policy is based on the principles of sustainable development.
Even if there has been an increase in consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or their environmentally friendly advertising, according to the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption at the Université de Sherbrooke.
Another finding: Half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates for products called fair, as well as the credibility of products and brands labelled as 'eco-responsible', says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, which is currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of the information lead 46% of consumers to reject this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers say they are also suspicious of the supposed returns of the ecological products or services being sold to them.
Moreover, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010, and in particular, they changed the brand of one or more products to respect their beliefs.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood's stores and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, the Barometer notes.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points out of a high of 100 this year), Homo consumus from Quebec loves to take the position of recycling king trying to reduce its impact on the environment by caring about wildlife protection.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be out of doors: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive survey of behaviour, which has just completed its first edition, support cycling and walking.
A loan for the state to buy back eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to make a financial commitment to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex for Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but only by means of a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, which were hoping for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back from Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent and return him to his true cinematic vocation, have not got what they asked for.
The government has agreed to get involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would in fact be less than the initial expectations; this could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a 12.8 million application last spring, but applications have since been revised downwards.
The President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris case, sent a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a final report about ten days ago.
However, SODEC received a counterproposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any event, it seems that the hypothesis of a State grant should be completely rejected.
The association of cinema owners and cinema complexes in Quebec opposed direct State investment to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, as it has not done so with other cinemas.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the resort, has been carrying the burden of the auteur cinema in his resort premises for ten years, having financed its own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Board.
The lack of independent movie theaters is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The Angus and the Parallèle companies, led by Christian Yaccarini, are also pushing for a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to make way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these theatres, the Parallèle, continues to screen films at eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three theatres on February 27th, showing the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada's complicated...
The new US diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks reveal what the US considers the complex of Canadians with respect to Americans, but also reflect the latter's feeling of superiority towards Canada.
US diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don't think about Canada-US relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget passed in 2009!
The four new communications between the US embassies in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday offer juicy details rather than substantial content.
A cable from September 22, 2008, during the height of the federal election campaign, tells of the extent to which the United States does not get involved in the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a virtually inherent inferiority complex of Canadians in dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign)", he writes.
Thus, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about".
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he thinks, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more so the leader of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting".
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"His trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, whereby Canada will run a deficit for the first time in a decade due to a $30-40 billion recovery plan", writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to prorogue Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that the opposition parties conditioned their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication from January 2008 signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington about the increasingly negative image of the drama series broadcast on the CBC in the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which make subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to conduct vigorous interrogations.
Another cable says that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to take some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner replied that yes, but that it depended "on a case-by-case basis".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State in relation to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin".
"The secretary has agreed to review the file".
Finally, we can mention that there has been a heating up in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, declared on CBC radio that the person responsible for this mass leak should be "murdered".
In the United States, they echo Mike Huckabee.
A Worldwide Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in a hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) by an amount that corresponds to almost a third of the additional decrease that must be made to stabilize the planet's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the series of major concrete projects that the UN hopes to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolise between 50 and 70 percent of the market, were replaced by fluorescent bulbs or, even better, by light emitting diode (LED) bulbs, much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to light humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the global car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the major emitter countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should be reduced to stabilise the temperature rise by 2°C by 2020 to prevent it from spiraling out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat and the remaining 5%, that is, produces light.
In the case of fluorescent light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by an additional twofold.
Fluoride light bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched this week by the manufacturer Philips (a company which also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives us an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be implemented in 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also run on rheostats and emit very little heat.
On top, they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put instructions on them.
However, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluorescent bulbs but coal-fired power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted on incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, such plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity and 8 million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 billion dollars in thermal power plants.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire to be published "immediately" as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent election commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately", a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"It calls on all parties and institutions in Côte d'Ivoire to show their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced".
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission has allowed Wednesday's deadline to pass at midnight without the results being released, three days after Sunday's vote.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CIS had commented on television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for the CIS to finally announce the winner of the second round between Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara have multiplied around the world.
However, Gbagbo's side is counting on the Constitutional Council to annul the "fraudulent" votes in the north, which have been held by the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager for the Ivory Coast president, has claimed that the FN's voter intimidation maneuvers in the north of the country have deterred supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The whole election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints made by Gbagbo.
Gbagbo's opponents, however, consider that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any links to the former rebels, has called the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and has called on Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after having prevented the election commission from releasing the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday should have put the icing on the cake for the reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two years.
The United Nations warned the Ivory Coast political class on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on the mainland (9.7% taking overseas departments into account), as shown by the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) data published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed in mainland France stands at 2,631,000.
The figures for the second quarter were confirmed, 9.3% of the working population in the mainland and 9.7% in the OCTs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has risen by 0.1 percentage points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter, but want to work, whether or not they are available to work in the two weeks and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of young people in the labour market continued to deteriorate, with the unemployment rate rising again to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
The unemployment rate among older people rose slightly to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50, a figure of 6.6% in the DOM.
Only unemployment among people aged 25-49 was stable, at 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
The Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a waste management company manager and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rhône general council, is under investigation and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is under investigation for abuse of social goods, misappropriation of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all questions posed by the magistrate, not ghosts".
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it is another thing to prove them", his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client appeared.
Mr Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night, they began investigating and also imprisoned one of his close associates, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all his client has done is take care of the landfills he has to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to lawyer Simon.
In the framework of this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, is being investigated for misappropriation of funds and complicity, but he has been released on parole and is forbidden to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been reproached against him".
"The investigating magistrate has taken account of the explanations and has released him", explained his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
The night of Tuesday to Wednesday, they interrogated four other people and released them, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been charged with "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "abduction and misappropriation of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "covering up the abuse of social goods".
Among those who have confronted Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect their companies have served to launder the capital of big banditry.
The investigation is being conducted in the context of several court proceedings initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications alleging fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the investigations are particularly focused on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elisha has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", has been a wake-up call for the French public, a wake-up call for diplomacy and a further deterioration in relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elisha has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice on how to manage their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the French girl was not in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking materials for Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the impression that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a key role in Clotilde Reiss's release.
He didn't actually do anything.
A diplomatic cable drafted on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled 'Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage-taking cases'.
The adviser to the Elise for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, are speaking with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly held in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "continuously release" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often still".
Because, once the attempts to negotiate through discreet channels are exhausted, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "experts in delaying maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a common Iranian tactic: hostage taking for political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will occur on August 16, the day she will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros reward).
Furthermore, he notes that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran", he says.
The date of 28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is being circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is being sought by the United States for smuggling sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge's decision.
The American embassy, like many observers, doubts this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is closing down Iran's clandestine networks of procurement of material for its nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Release the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures us that this was not the case.
Elisha, he says, is not only "very surprised by the judge's decision" but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot overturn the judicial decision", he says.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "closest" surveillance of French intelligence services.
The adviser of the Elisha dials a phone number, hangs up and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in some buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss's detention in Iran, the ELISA spared no effort, using statements and organized "leaks" in the media to make it appear that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and see that the manipulation is paying off, since several press articles report the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' by French officials".
What is the reason for such "gratitude" towards Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
"Despite their praiseful statements, French officials privately admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done".
The document then discusses the reasons that have led Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria", he said.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been dismissed as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris is trying to "show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy has a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier confided to him: "of course, we don't know whether the Syrians have done something or not".
"But we thanked you anyway".
"At least, this should cause confusion among Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
After midnight, Korean youths can't play online
The South Korean government is going to pass a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
A bill to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight to youths under 16 will be submitted to Parliament in December, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study in school and lead a normal life during the day".
"We think this law is necessary to protect their health and their right to sleep", Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the law's implementation, she says.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when parents of young people request it, the official added.
It will also make available free software to limit the time you spend on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various incidents linked to heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA names the host countries
Amid the storm of corruption allegations, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday designated the countries to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political election where influence struggles and lobbying can come to dominate technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue with its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Backstage transactions, therefore, may take until the last minute.
It is also difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee when they vote.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the chances of its footballing cradle, which hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the fire on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has highlighted three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset FIFA and embarrass British officials, who have been engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had won the London 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore Britain's glow to the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to their stadiums, already completed, their experience (World Cup in Spain, World Cup in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the gloomy economic and financial prospects of both countries could derail their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the British and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only give points to Russia, which has become a serious outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct reference to the accusations of the British press against EC members.
"They are bringing out their dirty laundry, trying to compromise them", Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems the most logical favorite.
The country, the world's leading economic power and home to FIFA's main sponsors, seems to have an advantage over Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new bids seem premature for two countries that jointly hosted the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the FIFA's fervent desire to award the 2026 World Cup to China, which would cause Asia to run out of opportunities for 2022.
Alongside Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weakness of paid TV rights (based on time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had not the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less.
One warrant on the Elisha leads to another.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate again in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not match well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
So you always have to pretend to doubt.
To this side and to that side.
In 2006, even if they didn't believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he didn't rule out a third term.
On 15 November, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the UMP deputies, on Tuesday evening in the Elise, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not even close.
The president merely indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
I was simply broadcasting the facts, not an advertisement.
This isn't the first time he's talked about the presidential race, with a witty tone, at meetings like this.
"In the worst, or best, case, you'll still spend seven and a half years with me", he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010, he said: "Don't think I don't think about what's coming next".
His remarks from the day before yesterday do not bring him any closer to the candidacy, nor any less.
They elicit comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has risen to the podium that makes Nicolas Sarkozy open up.
On the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people in the PS to demand that the battle be organized earlier than planned.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject", the Prime Minister's entourage reacted immediately and prudently.
"If he thinks he can lose, he will not be a candidate", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should provide the opportunity to define the way out of the crisis or at least to announce the suspension of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations which should be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis means that the Frankfurt issuer will certainly not be able to afford to be so forceful if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation on the European bond markets today.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde endorsed the ECB's active role in helping to resolve the European States' debt crisis.
He did not say whether he considered the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its government bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my opinion for my European colleagues"....
The ECB President, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no more eloquent in his intentions at his hearing in the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in Brussels the day before, saying only that the programme of buying government bonds on the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we will see what we decide" at Thursday's meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's purchase of Treasury bonds has doubled in the past week to about EUR 1.35 billion.
In addition, according to the market's prying eyes, yesterday he would have bought Irish and Portuguese bonds again.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion of securities since May 2010.
There is no doubt among market participants that purchases will continue (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in course.
Although over-the-counter lending has now disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations at favourable terms and durations ranging from one week to three months.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
"I don't imagine you'll be modifying your program considerably".
"Otherwise, there is a risk of new tensions in the short term", says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that a gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 will occur", anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
I'm going to Oppenheim.
Regarding interventions in the government bond market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of such bonds to keep the market stable", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the yields paid by the most fragile States", said a senior bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, governments will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government caps the storm
After Italy's start to the week was a worrying one, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the fall in the rates of 10-year bonds.
A recovery from the precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and that an "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the person concerned.
In any case, on Tuesday the spread against German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of the CRQs had soared to 263 points, causing a stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that in Spain the difference with German rates was over 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, expressed "deep concern" about "market turbulence" and a possible outbreak from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
The problem is in fact the lack of growth and the associated stagnation in income, which means that the State is at risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a pot of cold water for the government.
The Italian growth is estimated to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget under consideration in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions of EUR 7 billion could be implemented after the holidays.
'If necessary, further austerity measures must be adopted,' said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts are in good shape, as we have been saying for some time", says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011), the stabilisation efforts requested from Italy are less than those required from other countries", says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
There is the problem of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
This would open up a period of time which would be unfavourable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening crisis response mechanisms
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of Member States that have adopted the euro.
The easing of bond rates in the European countries yesterday, although relative, has given governments and the ECB a boost.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it may downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target of speculation at present.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs heavily on the banking systems", say the economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political pace is much slower than the market pace".
The European countries, aware of this gap and the dangers it poses, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing mechanisms for exiting the crisis.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly concerned and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are progressing well.
This is also in view of the Eurogroup and ECOFIN meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The agenda includes the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) Executive Director Klaus Regling began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform Far Eastern investors about developments in the European crisis.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, they certainly set the stage.
The first issues of EFSF securities are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the US would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are in addition to the austerity measures with a more immediate effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both sides want to avoid at all costs seeking international aid before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider indispensable to build confidence in a lasting way.
The capital partners of the European funds are also considering options to speed up the process of normalising the markets for government bonds.
On 24 November, while in Paris, Axel Weber was the first to suggest that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to bring the portfolio back.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an additional amount of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, 'preferably' in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
The instrument for this is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which currently has 60 billion euro.
The Council is not prepared to accept the Commission's proposal.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 districts on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and may affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are currently on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already on orange alert, 18 from Wednesday to noon and two, the Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group overnight.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall is affecting the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it is also snowing slightly in Île de France.
Snowfall of 2 to 5 cm, occasionally 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected departments, and 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Île de France and Limousin.
Snowfall is strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes have been banned from several departmental roads, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac roads.
According to the gendarmes, traffic on the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it is not driven except in case of necessity and the circulation of certain TER vehicles has been banned during the day.
On Thursday, school transportation has been banned in Picardy.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday evening to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% at Orly on Thursday because of the expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro of the Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on Île-de-France has reached its peak, billions have fallen.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the metro of the Grand Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To launch this GSP, the State has announced a funding allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this sum will enable the GSP to subsequently borrow on the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, we finally have the first accounts.
The 2010 Finance Amendment Act, which was considered by the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the provisions for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the introduction of a special equipment tax and the increase in the tax on offices in Île-de-France.
The first, as Article 15 of the draft law states, is 'for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris'.
It is also fixed in numbers: "The revenue from this tax is 117 million euros a year".
The second is a modification of an existing office tax 'to modernise it, increase its revenue and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris'.
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
The text does not give figures.
But it's far from four billion.
'It is specified that the tax resources are to be added to the EUR 4 billion allocation of funds to be mobilised by the State and to be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses', the statement of reasons reads.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment that income is created (the two taxes, ed.), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explain".
'It shall be entered in the budget and used as required.'
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will start to be received in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised 4 billion are not included in the appropriations, may provoke a slightly heated debate in Parliament.
The first public hearing will be on 7 December.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal which only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy which governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
It also heralds profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's take it one step at a time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" US revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Gaddafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long given ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only consist of publicly known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore devoted to esoteric publications, you will see that each work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what had been written in the earlier works.
This is not simply because occult writers do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for novelties about the nonexistent), but because occultists do not simply rely on what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, as is the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I don't know, editor of Libération), who only considers what he can acknowledge to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the US Embassy in Rome was sending to the State Department was the same as the one published by Newsweek the week before.
So why have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they are merely saying what every educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the Second World War and since Heads of State can call each other on the telephone or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representative exercises, have been transformed into spy centres.
Any viewer who watches investigative films knows this perfectly well, we just pretend not to know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image to American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can access the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world seriously affects the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal therefore affects both the victims and the "punishment".
But let's get to the real nature of what happened.
In the old days, in Orwell's time, you could think of yourself as a big brother who controlled every move of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, by being able to control every move through the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it's proven, as it is now, that even the crypts of power's secrets cannot escape a hacker's control, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the citizens' avenger) can know all the secrets of power.
How can you stand a power that can no longer even keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is in fact an empty secret, without a secret, since it comes from the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it has done, and a lot, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on such a powerful power?
It is clear that in future States will no longer be able to put confidential information online, as it would be like posting it on a street sign.
But it is also clear that with today's technology, you cannot expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State has travelled by air and contacted one of his counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, at the moment, my forecast is a science fiction and therefore a novel, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly in stagecoaches with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been memorized or, at most, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: in the end, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I've written that technology is currently moving forward like a crab, which is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a wired telegraph.
Video tapes (analog) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, going forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digital) only allow for moving forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, in enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travel it entails, we need three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication techniques to lead us back to horse-drawn carriages.
One last comment.
In the old days, the press tried to understand what was going on in secret in embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: France's failures to deliver on its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine whether the promises of fast-start financing made by developed countries have been honoured.
And the French tricks have been uncovered.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has committed €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million a year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU put on the table its best cards to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start funding is real: a report detailing the measures taken by its Member States, a press conference, a major accompanying event, the distribution of leaflets...
The transparency operation was appreciated for what it really is: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look at the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Accord, money must be 'new and additional' to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, each person chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained and 150 million are added over three years as fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of 'all new projects' in 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of French aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), as long as it intends to respect its commitment to 'new and additional' funds.
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no standard and each person chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that each euro borrowed is equivalent to one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments which are profitable (often emissions reduction projects based on more efficient technologies), it is a mistake to present a euro to be recovered as equivalent to a euro to be donated.
But France finds such reasoning unhelpful: it 'respects' its €420 million commitment by lending 91.5% (€389.8 million) and donating 8.5% (€36.1 million); see the EU document to see for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union which uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses 46% of the funds, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia, among others, meet their commitments with 100% of the funds.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to meet its commitment, France contributes only ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
That's a good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France is committing a double abuse: first, in relation to the actions over time and, second, in relation to the actual financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, it manages to give the impression that it spends 420 million "new and additional", as it had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has been the one who has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other member states continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early finance is a relatively short-term detail in relation to the whole of the climate negotiations.
But it could be just one more grain of sand in the vast machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope not.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early finance.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in line with the other EU countries.
But, in particular, France could advance the debate on the stakes in longterm financing (another key chapter currently being discussed): we will not get rid of the question of the 'additional character' or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have hope for the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will be arriving in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast starts and its view of the 'additional character' and use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward with the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (the ancient movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no statistical significance given the limited number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem", purchased in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the food that a child of about ten years usually consumes in four meals and a snack a day.
These model meals, which meet official recommendations (five servings of fresh fruit and vegetables, three servings of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day), as well as the treats, were tested in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance sheet is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five classified as safe carcinogens, and 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EDs), according to studies by institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although the legal limits for each chemical are not exceeded in virtually all cases individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is a concern", the association says.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about 20 residues that can damage the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil and intended as a school snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, which are used in food, and in which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna, and even bread or gum were spiced with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the tests revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutritious" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk to consumers from these "polluting cocktails" is "likely underestimated", the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb the rise in diseases associated with civilization.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
