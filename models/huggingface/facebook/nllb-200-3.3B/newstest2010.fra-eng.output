Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours and become the fourth US president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and cheque for $1.4 million will be awarded to him for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief and his wife Michelle will land in the Norwegian capital in the morning and have a busy schedule.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from among 172 individuals and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple's schedule then includes an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in a solemn ceremony in the afternoon where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the award, but only the third to be presented in the Committee's own building.
The White House has informed in advance that Obama will speak about the war in Afghanistan during the award ceremony.
The president doesn't want to avoid this subject because he is aware that he is receiving this award by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the moment.
He has stepped up the war effort even a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 1.1 million Euros).
He's planning to donate to charities, but he hasn't decided which ones yet.
His busy schedule will then take him and his wife to a banquet that will include not only the King and Queen of Norway but also the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was pretty reluctant to this price at first.
One of them was that of feeling unworthy of being a Christian.
He also repeatedly said that this was not a prize for him alone, but for all those who share his values.
He said that he would see this as an "invitation to action".
A conservationist accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police have charged the chairman of the Association of Nature Conservationists of Litoměřice with blackmail.
Several times last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesperson for the Litoměřice police.
The chairman of the Society of the Protectors of the Nature of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
The waste sorting bins are not in Brno
In Prague, anyone can sort his drinks, but in the villages of South Moravia, you'll find sorting bins on every street corner.
What about Brno?
It may take you several minutes to find the right containers.
I'm not saying that we wouldn't sort the waste in Brno at all.
But I have the impression that the city council of our city, the second largest in the country, is not sufficiently concerned with this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of waste sorting, not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but also because of the number of bins dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle into the city center?
It's a science, and it takes time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found so far is Moravia Square across from Potrefena Husa.
Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't mind me saying, but it seems like a lot.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city, it's not a sinkhole either.
And so, finally, a lot of my friends don't sort their trash.
Laziness is a bad habit.
It's a long walk to get to the bins.
I'm not surprised they're doing this.
I myself, after a party, I suggested that we go and throw some glass and PVC bottles.
Except I didn't see any colored dumpsters on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place when I went to take the tram.
Yet, the garbage was overflowing.
After all, this is the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city the best, right?!
It is probably because ecology and a so-called aestheticism do not interest the Brno socialists.
They would rather buy the city a place in the top hockey league that is a disgrace to the city nationwide, instead of buying a few more bins and offering to sort more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could back up my impression with official statistics after hanging around the internet for a while.
According to the EKO-KOM data, Brno is the worst in the whole South Moravian region.
Paroubek's budget has removed pensions and sick leave from the budget
After the left has increased, despite the advice of the government, farmers or even civil servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on the State debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists imposed the increase on certain classes, they based it on the fact that the government would borrow for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting off problems, undermining the ground", said Janota.
It is important to realize that the interest on borrowed money is increasing and that sooner or later it will have to be repaid.
The government really has no choice in where to get the money.
If he doesn't cut social welfare or his spending, he'll have to raise taxes.
To all those who the left has now increased: the firemen, the teachers, the farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and not have to worry about their pensions or their health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the cost of a larger debt of the State - so next year there will not be 163 billion in the coffers, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota the debt will grow faster and faster and with it, the interest-related expenditure.
The state will need money to pay it back and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or to reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
It will also be five billion short of completing the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already decided and started sections for which it is not possible to change the projects to reduce costs.
At most, you keep them, which is not free either.
This means that 30 major projects will be delayed or stopped, and the collection of EU funds is also at risk, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The Czech authorities have not provided any evidence that the State has taken over the State-owned electricity generation company ČEZ.
The problem is that the amount of the dividends is never certain and that it is by no means a bottomless pit.
Last year, 18 billion was sent from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP according to EU rules.
And that's not the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crime, and even housing savings, has been reduced by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international case, we will have to pay for it anyway, Janota said.
The minister will then have to save on the department's side or, in the worst case, touch the government's budget reserve.
The state treasury project, worth two billion, which is supposed to make it possible to track online the expenditure of each administration, is also short of 100 million.
The first phase will start in January.
If the finance minister cannot find money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions would be imposed, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will run two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed look promising.
Just a click and you're switching from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This is precisely the objective of the US company VMware, which is mainly concerned with the development of computer virtualization software.
We're going to allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate between personal and professional.
The two will work together, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and it was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It's coming to market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM, which was running the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems simultaneously.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and US carriers to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to the devices by 2012.
Hotel owners worried about lack of snow in the mountains
The problem of empty runways is not limited to the operators of ski lifts.
The lack of snow is discouraging people from booking ski trips at hotels and guesthouses.
As a result, it is always possible to find rooms available for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's.
We have a lot of hits on our website.
Internet users are browsing the offers, asking for prices but not daring to commit to booking at the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas", said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend your dream New Year in Špindlerův Mlýn, you should not hesitate to book a room.
If you put savings first and quality accommodation comes second, then you can try to wait a few more days.
The hotel owners in Špindler are currently only offering one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they'll try to put them in for a while, but they'll give in too and accept shorter terms.
And then the number of free rooms will decrease rapidly", Jandura said.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Christmas week is the most interesting for us at the moment, it is not completely sold out.
There's still room left in, say, half the rooms in our list.
That is why we have already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays at a lower cost", said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The tourist agency of Vrchlabí can also offer New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are going just as well, the remaining winter stays sell average.
This year, the interest in winter stays was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be full", Schiefert thinks.
In contrast, the occupancy rate of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We're up about five percent.
We have a few last seats left for New Year's and Christmas.
There is a great interest during the January holidays of Poles and February is also selling well", says Karel Rada, manager of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central car park in Jánské Lázně is also full to eighty percent during the New Year period.
In contrast, half the beds remain empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, when we have already had a sixty per cent occupancy at the present time.
February is a little weaker for now but as soon as the snow falls, the interest in stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow even more, said the manager of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
Hotel owners in the Krkonoše Mountains, however, should not expect more snow.
Thursday will be cooler and if there is any precipitation, it should be snowy in the mountains.
But eventually the weather should warm up, says Jiří Jakubský of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute's Hradec station.
United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is even comical to see the persistent effort by the wise President Barack Obama to replicate his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he himself considered simple.
When he finally let his long-awaited doctrine seep through, it turned out that he had carbon-copied it from Bush's Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not content with using the phrase 'as in Iraq' several times in the same text, he did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's speech in January 2007 as the title of his own speech: 'A new way forward'.
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements to a civil war-torn Iraq as "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences".
The following months, however, have shown that Bush's strategy, which was based on the recommendations of the field commanders, was the only one possible and likely to succeed to such an extent that the newspapers are not talking about Iraq at the moment.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, but objectively speaking, it left his successor with a much more favorable end-state than could have been hoped for.
Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again in Afghanistan
Again, it was the field commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan operation commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even sharply criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the subordination habits.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months, but for lack of a better option, he at least swindled the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He succeeded in extracting the promise of an additional 5 000 from Europe, although he had originally counted on 10 000.
The most problematic part of Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete the process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it answers.
Many doubt that a halving will produce the same results as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out for the exact opposite - no one can be trusted and no treaties are respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, who are used to changing leaders day after day as they see fit.
Political institutions, though officially established, will remain as dust behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly difficult to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in the absence of clarity in the relations, which are further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state of readiness", which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is perplexing because of its voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only gotten worse and is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and unrealistic heart can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the turmoil of war for their "prompt homecoming" will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for troop withdrawal is purely irresponsible as the Taliban will see it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the European will to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is turning negative.
European politicians do not know or do not want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor which could radically alter the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and if the increased sanctions do not have an effect on the Iranians, the Americans will be faced with the very difficult question of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
It will be necessary to answer this question, for example, when, according to Obama, America will have successfully withdrawn its troops from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will result in a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only downside for Obama is that he has three years until the presidential election and therefore has plenty of time to work out a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash bonuses from the bank .
Senior executives at the US bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this in response to the strong criticism of its payroll practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive stock instead of cash, which they won't be able to resell for five years.
The shares could be taken from the executives in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to link remuneration with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the overall direction it should take, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has come under criticism for setting aside nearly $17 billion in bonuses over the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premiums for the current year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the high premiums in the banking sector became a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it would impose a one-off tax of fifty percent on bankers' bonuses above £25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
Five women, a record number, were awarded the Nobel Prizes in technical and literary disciplines today in Stockholm by King Charles XVI Gustave of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German-Romanian writer Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their work on chromosomes, along with fellow American Jack Szostak.
The chemistry prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath together with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for their elucidation of the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner was the American Elinor Ostrom and her fellow countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn't have a winner this year was physics.
The prize was awarded to scientists Charles Kao for his research into optical fibres and George Smith and Willard Boyle for their invention of the CCD chip, which is now the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines and astronomical lenses.
Each laureate received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the prize money.
The total amount of aid in each category is SEK 10 million (approximately EUR 1.1 million).
If one of the races has more than one winner, they will share the prize.
The much-awaited Nobel Peace Prize was already awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his award, since he is only at the beginning of his career and is also the head of a country engaged in two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
He added that in certain situations war was necessary to achieve peace, even though the cost was high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning, Klaus invited him to the castle.
President Václav Klaus will be receiving Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is weighing his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is estimated that the budget and possibly Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda for their meeting on Friday.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
The deficit is too high, he said, and this is worsening the public finances crisis.
The meeting was announced by the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota then wants to discuss his position with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus for signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday endorsed the left's proposals for cash transfers and increased the remuneration of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government criticised the Social Democrats' proposals for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, a disagreement that calls into question the future of Fischer's cabinet which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget, as voted by MPs, removes the package of austerity measures passed by the Fischer government which he says is to curb the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but is not obliged to do so, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irrepressible deficiency" of public finances.
Now, he says, there is no favorable solution.
Only a strong government could bring about an improvement, if it could rely on a consensus of the wider political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is appalling and that the government should question its future existence.
The vice-president of the SDO, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, the SDO and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is staggering and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman is playing Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood movie.
Despite criticism of the fact that the lead roles are played by American actors, South Africans say that Hollywood's new film Invictus - Invincible will expose to the world much about the country, its struggles and its victories.
History is about sports, about race relations, about Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, stars in the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, the tireless fighter against South Africa's racist apartheid regime and first black president.
Freeman said, it was a ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I'm gonna play you, I should be able to see you in person.
The 72-year-old actor who won an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's boxing-centric drama Million Dollar Baby, for example, played the leader of an anti-slavery movement who himself became a slave, a fictional US president, or even God in the movie Evan Almighty, but never anyone alive today who is as important to so many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his hard work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning "undefeated" and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and South African rugby captain François to unify the country.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world rankings.
The South African team will eventually progress to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose than to play this role in a way that brought it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing to him was shaking her hand.
"I noticed that when I shake your hand, I get some of your energy, it gets transmitted and I felt like I knew how you felt", he said.
It's important to me to try to be someone else.
Matt Damon stars in the film as François Pienaar, the captain of a predominantly white rugby team.
The actor stated that he had six months to prepare for a role in the rugby-heavy middle.
For him, his first encounter with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door of the house, he opened it for me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between the actors and the actual models, Invictus under director Eastwood has received positive reviews and there is even talk of Oscar ambitions.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his appreciation: "It's a very good story, a very well-made film".
In the movie ratings on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive ratings.
The mystery of the Norwegian aura is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only acknowledged yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was again a failure and the Bulava missile, which was originally meant to be the pride of the Russian army, is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly or it was damaged in flight.
Russian newspapers refer to "Bulava" as "the missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th trial was initially running normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the equipment.
It was obviously the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, Bulava flew away from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be precisely fired from a moving boat and submerged
That's why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was most likely a faulty Bulava.
Nor do the Norwegians have any doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we can't speak of a complete failure.
The first two stages of the rocket were damaged and only the third was affected.
In the previous cases, the engines failed on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went without a hitch, the Defense Department's leadership believes that only six of the 13 have been failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent fills the generals with optimism and they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even carry ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary fetissov at 51 signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will be appearing in a professional match again at the age of 51.
The former world, Olympic and Stanley Cup champion will help his team CSKA Moscow in need and will probably already make his debut in Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we are in urgent need of another defender.
Fetissov's been training regularly and has agreed to help the team.
We still have to work out some details about the form, says the club's coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It was not specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only concern one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the event of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford and had 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov quintet is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
He twice won gold medals at the Olympic Games, seven world championship titles, won the Canada Cup and the world junior championship.
In the latter part of his career, he also garnered the respect of the NHL, where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancelled all overtime.
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
Spokesman Petr Vanek of the Hyundai plant confirmed it.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions on a working Saturday again this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The website Sedmička.cz reported that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded retrospectively for the working day of 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the extra for the overtime, or they can take a replacement leave on 28 December and thus extend their end-of-year holidays, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hot point in the comments and demands of the unions as well as of the employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory were forced to work two hours overtime almost every day in addition to their eight hours.
The unions plan to cancel the strike after the signing of the agreement.
The next negotiation between the car factory management and the unions is due to take place on Friday afternoon.
Union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the state of strike if their demands were agreed and a joint document signed.
The situation at the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees went on a spontaneous strike over unrelenting overtime.
They were also protesting against poor pay and so-called "bizutages".
The management argued that the employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements for the production of cars.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also demanded that employees who stopped production not be subjected to any sanctions.
The unions are calling on the company to reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want a salary of 5 000 kroner (approximately €209) for these.
The Hyundai automobile plant in Nošovice currently employs 2 000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
It has manufactured about 80,000 vehicles up to September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on HIV viruses 'enduring' too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow down the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to the drugs.
This reality in some cases overrides the fact that the combination does not act as strongly on common variants of the virus as well as some already available drugs.
There is no cure for AIDS at this time.
However, the lives of patients can be dramatically prolonged by a combination of drugs that prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body.
However, their use has a number of side effects.
In addition, suppression of this multiplication results in the development of so-called drug-resistant viruses, which are no longer resistant to drugs.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg, paves the way for a way of dealing with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metallocarbons are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the growth of the virus in a way that is different from any drug that has been used so far and that's why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their binding to the virus proteins.
Metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein in the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
Stopping the HIV protease also stops the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases was tested in test tubes and in resistant variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metallocarboranes on the current version of the enzyme is not as strong as on clinical drugs, but it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which current drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarbons, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modification, are therefore interesting combinations to be further investigated in the development of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS is going after Fischer, who is defending himself.
The President of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek, described the budget ratified for the following year as "frightening" and said that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should call into question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS's comments a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer worked.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether he will take the support of the minority in the Chamber of Deputies who are concerned with fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned with remaining in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Representatives ratified the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, but with the proposals for changes of up to 12 billion kroner included by the left.
The House has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, the running of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint about the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to run a deficit of Kč 163 billion.
The ODS left the Chamber before the vote, in accordance with the government's wish that a modified budget is a less bad alternative to an interim budget.
Disappointment and Uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a feeling of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still think about the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to resign if the proposed amendments were ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech TV, Janota made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday after his transition to the government:
He also indicated that he was wondering whether he would remain in office.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of ČSSD, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House passes other bills that increase the deficit, such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not involved.
This is the case of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing harmful, Topolánek stressed in a text-based statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries are claiming TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the deadline for the submission of proposals to the Council for the adoption of a new regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products.
That said, he must not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda I will deal with it, Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was elected to the government by the Democrats, told reporters in the House.
Prime Minister Fischer flew off this afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
The ODS backed down at the Prime Minister's request.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should be consulted on the draft budget for the next financial year.
We do not feel we are orphans, we are not little children, he said when asked whether the ODS had not been criticised by the party's president in the House of Representatives or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I didn't notice that my vote was off.
I knew already when I resigned that what would follow in the coming months would be a Bolshevization of the House and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek said in person.
According to the new schedule of ČD there will be fewer trains for the same fares.
The Czech railways will abolish or restrict from 13 December certain express or regional trains with less traffic and will instead increase some others.
The total transport coverage will fall on the day the new timetables come into force by two per cent compared to today.
Most fares will remain unchanged, including the basic and reduced fares.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, and the railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express train will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the direct Prague - Letohrad line will be drastically reduced.
At regional level, the largest decline in transport is in the Hradec Králové region of eight per cent in total, whereas Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague-Tábor-České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the running of some express trains on the Prague-Písek-České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days a week.
The biggest changes included the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the time being the inhabitants of Milovice had to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, which was opened following the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague's main railway station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for the regional railways: 200 million more.
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the railways next year in total four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, which until now has always been for one year.
The railways appreciate the system, which is also why they have not resorted to price increases for the vast majority of transport tickets.
The changes will only affect the one-day tickets ČD Net and the discounted eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kr.
The price of eLiška will now depend on the distance travelled, whereas it was valid between cities in a given region and was at a single rate of 160 krona.
Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, children have been released
Rebels have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including some primary school students and their teachers.
AFP news agency reported this, but said only 65 hostages were taken.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that some 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields in a police escape.
Local negotiators are now trying to reach an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, the police initially pursued the kidnappers after violence broke out during a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law has been declared in the southern Philippine province of Maguindanao over a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as was his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao also has active Muslim separatists.
They did, however, renew peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa is about everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
The new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood arrives in American theaters in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter has returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to play him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was given to Matt Damon.
As the film hits theaters, the feedback from critics and the public is coming in.
Nelson Mandela, the man who fought for
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film holds great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is preparing for the World Cup and the media is agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination against the people by the black majority in power.
Reactions to the new film are so far mostly positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations about the leading roles where Hollywood stars "pawn" .
Morgan Freeman, however, in his own words, is proud of the film.
I've dreamed of this role for years and I've prepared well.
I also met Nelson Mandela personally many times so that I could - as we say - recover some of his energy, he said at the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember through the film Mandela's personality and message.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual, he added.
Wearing the rugby national team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave his creation to the people portrayed the South African defender of human rights during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman attempts to reconcile two racial groups in a long-divided population, and as Nelson Mandela in 1995 he wears the national team jersey on the field of the World Cup, which South Africa won.
For showing up on the lawn in a jersey, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been applauded at length fourteen years ago by the mainly white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Let's hope the football championship will succeed in uniting people again as one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" in the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
However, white South Africans are skeptical, as recently stated in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship began on 11 June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns burns in the Louny area
A fire engulfed a transformer of the company Čeps from the distribution center near the town of Výškov na Lounsku in the morning.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman of the Ústí Fire Brigade, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally planned to let the transformer burn out, but they changed their mind and put out the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical malfunction, an internal short circuit in the transformer.
No one was injured and according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated to be in the tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure will be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced with a new one.
It added that in its ten years of activity, Čeps had never experienced anything like this and that such incidents were isolated.
The electricity supply has not been interrupted, says the spokeswoman of the ČEZ company for North Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of households, administrations and industries has not been affected by the fire of the transformation plant.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech Republic of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission systems and lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transmission to distribution systems and lines with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will file a defamation lawsuit against three prefects of the ČSSD
Radim Jančura, the owner of Student Agency, is filing a defamation lawsuit today against three Social Democrat prefects.
In particular against Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, against Radko Martínka from the Pardubice Region and against the prefect of the Olomouc Region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura has indicated this in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnál.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain areas.
However, all the regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of them attacked us and claimed we were being a cheap mouth, when we were only bidding for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So we're left with nothing but to defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for slanders about the Student Agency society, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
It also said it had evidence that no region had acted in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Mr. Jančura's complaint is the continuation of Mr. Hašek's media spectacle, which he uses as free publicity for his company and himself.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on others to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating public opinion and making false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura already informed last week that he will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he will stop the campaign after Christmas and that he plans to resume it after New Year.
He said the campaign would target corruption in the broadest sense.
Jančura started his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the railway lines for a contract worth about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a tender.
Jančura claims that such a way of acting is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought Jančura threats from a ČSSD deputy.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of ČSSD, I don't know who he is but I won't say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Vaccination against pneumococci will be free and optional
The pneumonia vaccination will overturn the old habits as of January.
It will be the first to be free of charge and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumocococ vaccination are in full swing.
The pharmaceutical institute already sets the maximum prices that health insurers will pay for vaccines.
Experts also see clearly in the vaccination process.
Another vaccination.
Free vaccines for the children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal disease.
The condition is that they haven't been vaccinated yet.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life.
Last year already a quarter of the families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
Yet the parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
The youngest require four doses.
Experts estimate that health insurance companies spend between $300,000 and $450,000 a year on vaccines.
They save money on medical care that would be required for unvaccinated children.
Until now the state has spent about 500 000 crowns a year for all the vaccination of children.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci cause inflammation of the middle ear and also serious infections, including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there have been as many as 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 years due to pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
There are some reports about a possible vaccination requirement in the future.
From January onwards, it must be covered by insurance and is optional.
For example, the president of the association, Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský, said that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcal disease.
At an international conference that our association attended, the experts were not really happy that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have been able to impose at least this.
I think this is the direction we should take now", said Kalovský.
But the health department doesn't want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not considering it at the moment", said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The doctors say that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament and the Council should be consulted on the draft directive on the protection of the health of workers from the risks of chemical, physical and biological agents.
"In a situation where the vaccine costs so much money, I understand the decision to make vaccination optional", says Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
The pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough because it is the first vaccination of children that is financed by insurance and not by the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance companies should free up funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
However, this is linked to the concerns of paediatric practitioners, who are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by the insurance companies, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some MEPs feared, however, that this would allow insurances to 'deduct health insurance premiums'.
So doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance companies to reimburse them.
It is estimated that individual paediatricians will have to spend up to 40,000 crowns a month on vaccines, which is a considerable sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "museum robbery"
The son of renowned illustrator Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (£12 million) from his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and into a trailer.
She said Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force their way into the museum in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his designs of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police statement, the said Mr. Frazetta Jr., 52, claimed to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies giving such authorization, the agency said.
Labour is in favour of raising the budget tax.
The ministers defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor has also drawn fire by attacking low and middle wages.
Among his main proposals, we can see a 0.5% increase in Social Security and a 1% ceiling rate on public salaries from 2011.
The wrath of Social Security
The unions protested that low wages were being penalized by a recession for which they were not responsible and warned that "problems" were looming.
The cut in Social Security - which will bring in about £3 billion a year - has angered the business community, who say it is a tax on jobs when the aim should be to revive the economy.
The increase, for those earning more than GBP 20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
The Commission has also adopted a communication on the implementation of the European
Social insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on the bonuses of bankers
The corporate income tax increase for small corporations was dropped
Tax rebates for electric cars and wind turbines
Pension increase of 2.5%
According to the Treasury's estimates, a person earning GBP 30 000 would lose GBP 90 per year and a person earning GBP 40 000 would lose GBP 190 per year, while a person earning GBP 10 000 per year would earn an additional GBP 110 per year.
Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would fall on the top 5% of wage earners.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms dismissed a tax increase and stressed that a reduction in spending was a "drop in the bucket" compared to what was needed.
"These are important figures, and they will enable us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years", he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident that economic growth would resume by the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - have been thrown into doubt after the Chancellor was forced to revise his early figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would probably shrink by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while debt would be 3 billion euros higher than the previous estimate.
"Opportunity wasted"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign on Thursday warning against Labour's "debt crisis", have said that the plan to borrow £789 billion over the next six years is not viable.
Ministers failed to come up with a credible plan on how to pay back, they added, cynically evading difficult choices until after the elections - due in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything meaningful about what they were going to do", said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary to the Treasury in the Shadow Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it".
"The big announcements will be made after the election, no matter who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte, and his team.
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from the next cuts, contrary to the Tory proposals which would result in a faster and larger reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems said the money raised from tax hikes and spending cuts would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on thin air".
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, claimed that the timing of the announcements - such as the inflationary increase for certain disability benefits in April next year, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda charges, with the money simply being recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that extra help is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget" is the word.
Although ministers did not publish details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that public spending restraints would only begin to make themselves felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Chancellor's figures imply substantial cuts in many areas in the future, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defense.
"The pain is actually just postponed", said its Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of who wins", added Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report, and the markets know it".
FBI investigates "arrests of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said they were investigating whether these were the same men who were reported missing from their home in the US state of Virginia last month.
The US State Department said it was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are described as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are US citizens, of course we would like to know what the charges are and under what conditions they are being held", said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been made aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing", she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house owned by the uncle of one of them.
She said the house was already under surveillance by local police and no charges had been brought against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported, but said the United States should "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing from their homes in northern Virginia by their families in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuses" of the rule of law
According to the report of Amnesty International, human rights have been violated as little as ever in the last 20 years.
The report presents "repeated violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its human rights record.
The authorities claimed that such criticism was politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens were sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, the BBC's correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the start of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"False Confession" by the
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer science student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed he was accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face", he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me".
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still bloodied and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate in the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
Iranian authorities have denied the rape allegations, but have admitted that abuse took place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian parliament and judiciary set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in an attempt to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
Over 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform the Bristol site into a racing track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Parkway, a small stepping stone preceded a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the view from the top of the airstrip was beautiful but that it was quite intimidating.
It's a beautiful view, with all the city lights twinkling down below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents", he added.
Prizes were awarded to the best voltiges - or figures - on the track.
After the party on Thursday night, the snow will be left to melt.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte, and I'm not sure I understand.
Some readers will be drawn to this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French Don't Like the Scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-researched study of an issue that has divided and preoccupied the country for the last fifteen years and whose effects are still being felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book is a much broader and more ambitious plot.
A good anthropologist, he is not only interested in what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5-6 million Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that are the media's concern.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't really take the debate to the end.
The Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts advocating a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia which today makes up a small part of Europe's Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of both sides.
He asks how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite, so vigorously guarding secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
In his view, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet".
The world's darkest view
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes up the continent is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing into new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a Thin Layer of Ice", author and illustrator Richard Ellis paints a natural history of the Great North's symbol, the polar bear.
With a knowledge of the history and intricate policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved their worth by hunting the polar bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then a brave 14-year-old aspiring officer who had only the tip of his musket to fight with, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
Young cubs, captured while swimming alongside their newly killed mother, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
In the early 20th century, one famous show was held where 75 bears were gathered together.
Today, the size of a zoo is still typically one millionth of the area needed for an adult to live in freedom. The climate is rarely indicated: even a polar bear living in Singapore turned green because of algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often reflects on the threat hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians on motorcycles use powerful assault rifles to hunt their prey.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of the science of the Arctic and a captivating glimpse of what the future might be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can accurately describe the rate of change.
It's not for lack of trying.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the pioneering voyages of Fridtjof Nansen provided the first information about the melting of the ice sheet.
Cold War submarines then mapped the changes in the relief below it.
Satellite surveillance and probes on icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary, tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by the lattice-like water of the frozen sea.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, all will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, it may be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 who laid wreaths at the Arlington National Cemetery.
First-class De'Angelo Robinson, 19, took a seven-hour bus ride to lay a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he'd never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, once, were in their place.
In a few months, wherever we are sent from, we may be in their place", Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to be respectful.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in various sections of Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, initiated the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, in continuation of an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year, stopping at various towns along the way, to hold commemorations in honor of military personnel and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves of Arlington National Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and at the memorial site for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated over $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her late husband, a career military man.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, it was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed.
It's a small gesture civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the vast hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose old graves, dating from World War I and II, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not visited as often as new graves, organizers said.
The mood was one of optimism, as children played and couples held hands, carrying fresh pine wreaths over the gray graves.
Each round crown was a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
There was almost total silence in Section 60, where most of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying openly, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved on the stone while others bent down to see the small black and white information cards, buried in the wet earth for those whose tombs were not yet completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wept at the grave of her son.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio and had driven eight hours to come and rest at the grave of Marine Gunnery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget the reason we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him".
A U.S. citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, the U.S. State Department said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities and the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5th.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how she and her husband are being followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive awards but has always been denied permission.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the Communist government of the Brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration which is pursuing a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by The New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government move forward with concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the US can retaliate.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are both new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average civil servant's salary is $15 a month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones, which are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
It's rare for an American to be detained in Cuba.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press officer for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arresting and detaining is a big mistake.
An activity that in any other open society would be allowed -- handing out free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas Program Director at Human Rights Watch, who recently released a scathing report on freedoms in Cuba, called "The New Castro, Even Cuba", referring to Raul Castro's installation as the country's leader to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
According to Vivanco, an accused person is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are beginning to engage in a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities foil plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization allegedly preparing a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hoped the case would help dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet in search of radicalised young men.
Investigators claimed they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality known as Saifullah who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving of the terrorist waves on the Internet video site YouTube.
Upon arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who attempted to help them reach the remote tribal belt region of Pakistan, home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast that had become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The official said the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to enter al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence community has made it a priority to infiltrate men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters act as gatekeepers, denying entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
Analysts say potential American recruits are being closely watched by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert with the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also had to be increasingly careful in recent years in choosing whom they accept as US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment pattern that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is one that's increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for climate "action"
Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets here on Saturday, demanding more climate action from negotiators working at the city's Bella Convention Center.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but police estimates put it at 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a small number of masked activists detonated some explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On this day when little has happened at the United Nations-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city, displaying signs in English saying 'There is no Planet B' and one in Spanish, declaring 'The Earth says she's had enough.'
Several celebrities joined the protest, including top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's home country of Peru opened her eyes to the heartbreaking problems the country faces due to the impact of climate change that is already happening".
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the great march -- to spread the word and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions", she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it can no longer be avoided.
Police stopped protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing masks or were in possession of pocket knives.
Police have stopped protesters from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said they have arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing masks or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in the climate talks, the activists who wore masks and black clothing, set off several explosives near Copenhagen's main canal which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were dropping them near buildings, he said, adding that they were rockets at first, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Congress Hall, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to raise the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's representative for climate.
When asked if he thought a protest would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English: "Actually, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating "The event being important, I cannot hear what is happening outside".
He observed that walking could seem harmful or beneficial depending on the perspective.
He said that the report showed the interest of the general public and the various sectors in the subject of climate change.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others".
Test results reveal stubborn differences between races
Last week's federal math score report brought good news for Washington, D.C.'s public schools.
Although the District still lags far behind the top schools, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) have made much greater progress in the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the continuing gap between African-American and white achievement at both the local and national levels.
The average grades of white grade 4 (cm1) children in Washington, D.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The achievement gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling by only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white score was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The overall picture over a six-year period is not encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 classroom (cm1), when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the scores of children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the surge celebrated by school board director Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) was being driven by white students who were already good students.
That would mean we've raised the aggregate by considering the items at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing", said Jeff Smith, director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality in District education.
I'm not excited about one or two points", said Kwame R. Brown (Democrat), D.C. Council Member whose daughter is in Grade 4 at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message of the test results is that the city's middle schools (colleges) are in desperate need of attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect that.
But what's scary is that we're not putting enough time and energy into our middle schools.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, for schoolchildren in the late elementary and early middle grades who have not integrated the basics of reading earlier in their schooling and who are lagging behind their peers.
Each day, the math curriculum for grades Kindergarten through 6th grade emphasizes games and real-life experiences, as they were put into place in the District by former District Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is also to be credited for the progress the NAEP reported last week.
I simply think we need to keep working to provide better interventions for these students who are below the classroom level", said Rhee.
Others feel that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall system's results while providing money and resources to schools with poorer results to reduce the gap.
It's a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies test scores in cities.
The conventional policy solution is to focus your resources and management reforms on schools in the poorest neighborhoods in Washington.
This targeting may therefore have political implications which hamper this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendent of Schools, she's trying to use the middle class of white and black.
We are focused on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, no matter where they come from, are assured that their children can get a great public education.
Janey, now the Superintendent of Schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements in reducing the achievement gap was the length of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year for 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" to get another raise on the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, comes down and blinks at the white columns, brick facades, and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 students in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition is $38,690 per year, her attitude was less of a new student impressed than enthusiastic.
"I'm going to study medicine!" exclaimed Graciela, as the guide led them to the entrance of the science building.
"You're really a lawyer?" she said, when she was told of the low law student-teacher ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh place the kids visited during their three-day journey of discovery, and now they had fully integrated the message: It's not about whether you go to college:
The question is where.
While this question still largely arises for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school and became parents as teenagers, they are also hundreds of thousands who are benefiting from the university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five 'second generation' Hispanics complete high school - a remarkable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, paving the way for the next generations to play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study the doormat say that the doormat has a natural affinity for school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high standards for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentorship programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of other children like her get to college -- especially if her efforts are consistent and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who don't have the experience and the skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention at any time will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal programme which funded the visit to Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to run college-preparatory programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue through high school.
Since 1999, the program has been taken by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry gets agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its troubled infrastructure during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the recovery of Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies are left with a stake in only two of the 10 fields put up for auction.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who bid on it lost.
Two American companies have won contracts for the fields put up for auction in June.
The weak representation of the American oil giants in the opening up of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news site.
It will be a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, reinforced by massive coordinated bombing Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops withdraw have held back American oil companies, preventing them from entering with more force into Iraq, which has the world's third-largest crude oil reserves, analysts say.
US companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged by their rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were notably lower and who were more willing to take risks because they were not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only US companies to obtain contracts from the Ministry.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have had strong ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have provided technical advice, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
State-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. bid on contracts more than other companies and walked away with significant stakes in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse", said Assam Jihad, spokesperson for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on a par with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected companies to bid made bids which were then compared to the price per barrel that the ministry agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the top organizers of al-Qaeda was reportedly killed in Pakistan
An American missile that struck along the border with Afghanistan appears to have killed one of al-Qaida's operational organizers this week, U.S. counterintelligence officials said Friday.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the area.
Local authorities claimed the missiles were fired from a CIA-type unmanned aircraft, inside Pakistan's lawless tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistan's civil intelligence, speaking on Miran Shah's phone.
Authorities said suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of "completely dismembered bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identities of the victims, but the two US counter-terrorism officials provided unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the senior military organizers of al-Qaida who directed the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organise plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this likely included plotting attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directives of al-Qaeda leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second official of the US said that Somalia had rapidly advanced in the ranks of al-Qaeda and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the American public, but that does not diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official.
If confirmed dead, Somali would be the second major al-Qaida or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, and three other operatives.
The rate of CIA drone attacks has decreased since the summer from about six operations a month to two, according to figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to decrease their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informers, the site claims.
UN special envoy to Kabul withdraws
UN special envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the US timetable for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the US and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but would simply honor a commitment he made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura was mentioned; he is an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently presided over a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guehenno, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential election and concealing evidence of widespread electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations but said Galbraith's accusations - which were thanked - "had a detrimental effect on the mission because there was already a good deal of skepticism about international observation of the elections".
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the US and other Western countries than the mission in Afghanistan, saying it would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy UN hiring regulations were hindering his ability to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that major world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran over its inability to engage in talks over nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a gathering of 300 American troops in northern Iraq during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, de-dramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs heavily on me is that if there's one thing I've learned in Iraq over the past six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has indicated that some of those sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that a "set of motivations and punishments" may be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people would suffer immensely' from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back into full compliance with the UN Security Council and its watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran insists that it wants to develop its nuclear experimentation for peaceful purposes only.
At the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume talks on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to give up a significant part of his stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration pushed for such an agreement as a way to build trust between both sides and to buy time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts at a deal - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran's hardening in the face of some of the proposals from the international community that they had actually agreed to in early October, has pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to come together on what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set December 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before turning to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "enhanced sanctions".
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "baseless allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late on Friday, met early in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with the troop chiefs in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly over borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce potential conflict to avoid any delays in US plans to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurds' anxiety about the pending withdrawal. US officials have quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzani, the President of the Kurdistan Regional Government, "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you".
China's Aging Community Is Changing Its Leadership
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "Another baby is an extra grave".
They learned the lesson so well that the Shanghai government authorities, alarmed by their city's low birth rate and aging population, changed direction this summer and started encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was immediate and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
"We don't have a second left", said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an eight-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China introduced the one-child policy, creating two generations of one-children notoriously good-natured and spoiled, dubbed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate has fallen from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to skyrocket from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, this figure is well above the global average of around 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and above accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission said that fertile couples should have babies in order to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of manpower in the future".
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming "as old - but not as rich, though - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden", she said.
A gradual easing
Drafted into the country's 1978 constitution, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced by the Communist government to date.
Couples who violate this policy risk paying colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and facing discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese authorities have given the police the task of helping the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced the abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced women who were pregnant with a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the population authorities have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they made more exceptions to the rule -- including for city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases where the man and woman are already only children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said that central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who is allowed to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples at their homes and slip out flyers under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial counselling for those who wish to have more than one child.
According to the family planning officer, the answer was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city outside Shanghai say they saw an increase in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign launched, the more urban district reported no change.
Huinan, for example, with a population of 115,000, still receives only four or five applications a month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in the Shanghai district of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to have two.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and the life insurance given by the government.
Without social security, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly view the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It's true, they're robbing us of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of human resources, said she only wanted one child because she was an only child herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone looking out for us".
We are not used to taking care of someone else and we really do not want to take care of others".
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation company, said it more bluntly.
For the middle-class, working-class couples who are driving down the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish to succeed.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up seeing their parents struggle in the early days of capitalist China and don't want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from his parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there's the space issues -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child is only nine months old, you need to write his resume to get a place in the best kindergarten".
Most of his friends are willing to do this experiment once, Chen says, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN group has draft plans for reducing emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized allocations and mutual recriminations -- came back into the spotlight on Friday, as a document was released highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in the time-strapped negotiations, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
The text, drafted by a special UN working group, does not say how much the rich countries would give to the poor to help with global warming, both in the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging economies could reduce their carbon output and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
It gives the process a great deal of flexibility, said John Coequyt, the Sierra Club's Washington representative.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's Executive Secretary for Climate Change, Yvo de Boer, described as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrialized nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020 by 25 to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce theirs by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched the negotiations on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to cope with floods and droughts or to prevent deforestation.
However, on Friday the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the US representative at the climate negotiations, rejected any discussion of forcing industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gases, compared to the voluntary efforts of the major emerging economies, if they were not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The US will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the main developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern's comments came an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top US negotiator either lacked "common sense" or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the US would not give China financial aid to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States bickering over their respective obligations while the poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers were fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold the major emitters accountable for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is being developed", said Ulate, who is also the Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries that are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the negotiations will lead to at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drew up a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the European Commission's Climate Unit, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the whole political process", partly because they are now unified and calling on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debate became a matter of urgency as delegates focused on the need to resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government could reach an agreement.
High-level officials such as India's environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice minister stepped off their planes and rushed to the Bella Center building for closed-door meetings and briefings, so that they could make claims that would be considered over the next week.
The real image of the rally -- where 13,000 people come in and out of the convention center every day -- activists playing guitar performing late-night shows mocking countries that they say are betraying each other and proposals being written and distributed on paper instead of emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and by Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
"We are entering the court of the great", said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 140 miles an hour will redefine Monday syndrome.
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will go through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution in transportation in Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 140 miles per hour as it runs from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin commuter train out of London.
He hopes the new service will allow Britain to join an international network of fast and reliable trains and link the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Small lost holes will become thriving suburban cities, business travel times will be much shorter, and the switch from airplanes and cars to trains will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, all three main political parties are in favour of this project.
But the £10 billion needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental hazards are likely to hold back Britain's high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will hand over its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will enable it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line from London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final route.
It is also planned that HS2 will present three options for a larger high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high speed line will go all the way to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two at or near Birmingham, with one branch going west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going north-east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will run through Scotland.
'It seems that this will be the best option for performance' said a rail professional.
When this is completed, the journey time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey today.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK's network the fastest in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow trains of 400m length and carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on a London to Birmingham line.
A terminal with a capacity of 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Due to space constraints, it is planned that an existing station will be enlarged to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should go ahead, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if he launches the machine, the network will have to be built piece by piece.
Trains will first be forced off the high-speed lines on the existing track north of Birmingham, keeping journey times between London and Scotland to over three hours.
This seems to be the best solution for a switch from airplanes to trains, and it is a point of reference for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers pay back £75,000 loan for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the leading Tory MP, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orange grove he built in his constituency home.
The party leader who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were "kept up", increased his loan by £75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He was authorized to charge the taxpayer the extra interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a Members' Expenditure Review.
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland-Melton constituency.
The adjoining houses were sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the memorial office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a porch to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "pleasure porch".
Mr Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent inquiry by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee into his previous borrowing arrangements.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance, following an investigation into his spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan altered the legal security of the £271,406 loan from his London estate to his constituency house which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became an MP.
Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan was claiming around £1,400 a month in borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, his demands increased by more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the GBP 75000 loan.
The RBS standard variable interest rate went from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, and has remained unchanged since then.
The latest release from the Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan was still asking for £1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Chief of the Shadow Cabinet in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him declaring that members of parliament had to survive "over budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on a budget" and you are treated as "of the m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small share, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for a hell of a lot more, but I didn't".
The MP, a millionaire from his former job as an oil trader, began having to explain his spending in May after it emerged that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the expenses office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a £-shaped hole in Mr Duncan's lawn, to protest after it was revealed that he had been asking for £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the loan increase last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for capital improvements, approved by both the expense office and then Legg".
He added: "There is no problem with evasion or making up or using the rules or anything.
It was very clear, it was in the rules, it was allowed, and so on.
It couldn't be clearer or simpler".
All you faithful, come and see the Brighton Advent calendar.
Brighton Beach Cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 homeowners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using Christmas carols as a theme.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last booth, from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. daily, with free pasta and hot wine served.
The Christmas carols chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the booth features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-paid priest from the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be more accessible to people in a post-Christian society.
"Why do we as a church wait for people to enter a strange old building? I think the church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more engaging way.
"The idea for the advent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends, over dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent that through spirituality".
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and around the world for the climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, across the world and in Copenhagen, where police made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, and 100,000 according to organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, which is due to reach an agreement by Friday that could come into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, exemplified by these protests, has helped make the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the procession left, when a group of 300 protesters, dressed in all black, smashed glass windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP reporter noted.
Riot police quickly intervened.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of the "Blacks Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had become prominent at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the protest, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", stressing that about 100 of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night" handcuffed and kept in a sitting position despite the extreme cold.
The Parliamentary Party, the rather good-natured procession, has taken over the Bella Center, the site of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators had come by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoats, had formed a first morning gathering in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying to ourselves: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that are drying up in Africa, streams that you can walk on like you've never walked before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the globalist movement has become closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a leading globalist, said he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no separation between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas touting solar power.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, as well as in Canada, rallies of a few hundred protesters were also held to call for strong action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the "350" network brought together several hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, a few dozen people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elects its president, Georgia says it is a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian breakaway region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounced it as a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were expected to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The turnout was 58% a few hours before the closing, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including the incumbent president, Sergey Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the elections.
This election is a farce.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, for his part, "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the full occupation of Russia", his spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladze said.
Russia is the only country other than Nicaragua and Venezuela to recognize the independence of the territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After breaking away from Georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict, which left thousands dead, Abkhazia is seeking to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential campaign in this region of rich landscapes, on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Mr. Bagapch alongside Russia's President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are posted all over this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to observe the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations", replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the elections by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as the one that ceded control of the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Protests around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched across the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding climate deal at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police made off-the-cuff arrests of nearly 700 people on the sidelines of a massive protest.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts until December 18 the delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that should come into force on January 1, 2013.
The Parliament's party, the procession, generally well-behaved, headed to the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up for the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred protesters, all dressed in black, armed with bricks and hammers, smashed windows, an AFP journalist noted.
Riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened without mercy, throwing several of them to the ground.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, saying they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had made a name for themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a policeman was injured in the jaw by a brick and four cars set on fire near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We have our eyes on the extremist groups, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, as police helicopters circled in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came by bus and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky-blue raincoats, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying we have time, said Angélique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, there are streams that you can walk on that you've never walked on before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which began in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the globalist movement has become closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told AFP he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no separation between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN High Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who were to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and sporting bandanas touting solar power in front of the Philippine capital's city hall.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred protesters were also held to demand action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the "350" network brought together several hundred people, particularly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).

The reform of the general secondary school strengthens the geohistory, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "reinforced" by the reform of the general lycée, despite the abolition of their compulsory teaching in the science term.
From now on, all first-year students will have four hours a week and the same programme for a shared culture, says Mr Chatel.
The Minister said that "we must get rid of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "S is no longer a scientific school" but "basically, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L courses cannot remain sub-fields of the S, he continues, stressing: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals outraged at the lack of history-geography in the final year of high-technology schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) disapprove of the government's plan to abolish the compulsory teaching of history-geography in the final S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized the suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing officials.
The Minister added, however, that there was "no question" of abolishing the philosophy of the terminal S programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, as 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which according to them sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an admissibility test at the beginning of the year, which will focus on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test, which will focus on their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also undertake practical training during the M2 year and then spend a first year in front of pupils as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, which is more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister said that he would propose "the individual right to education, which does not exist in the National Education System".
It also reaffirms the plan to abolish the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues at the Copenhagen summit: this was the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Ulm Street, took up on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize winner, opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day of a series of 15-minute expert talks, each filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist noted.
We wanted to do something that would capture people's attention and make them want to know more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organisers of the day, which takes its name from the name given by the students to the fish in the school pond.
He said that about 20 speakers were chosen from among experts in their fields and that they were selected for their charismatic side.
On global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes", Jean Jouzel told AFP, speaking without notes but using graphs in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as scientists, he said, hoping that the audience would remember that 'the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific issue'.
The videos from these conferences will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Delayed payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
The prison guards' unions called for a "general mobilization" on Friday to demand the payment of bonuses and overtime by the end of the year, which was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penitentiaire (2nd union of prison guards) asked the staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate on Tuesday morning in front of the prison establishments and "block" them, to "denounce the theft of their debts".
The CGT-penitentiary (the third trade union) calls on them to "gather in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", considering "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the leading prison guards' union, the Federal Union of Independent Prisons (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization . . . to bring back the discontent and anger".
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and not all of it has been budgeted, but they assure that the remaining overtime will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing them that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by the staff to modernise and operate our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I have asked the prison administration to put in place a set of measures without delay to ensure that this situation arising from an incorrect assessment of the number of overtime hours does not happen again in the future, adds Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be meager, except for the managerial staff who benefit from the famous premiums for functions and objectives, lamented the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have a good back".
This is a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille was outraged, announcing its decision to boycott "all meetings and convocations" until further notice.
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and public holidays if those of October are not regularised in December, as well as for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take on the money of the staff, according to the CGT-penitentiaire of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less badly off than others.
But in any case, the account is not there, said the Secretary-General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he gives away "better treats" for Christmas than he gets
US President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with his family in the White House, told Oprah Winfrey that he has a simple rule when it comes to gifts: "I give out better things than I receive".
In a special broadcast on ABC Sunday night, the president and his wife Michelle offered an overview of how they plan to celebrate the holiday season in their new prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be in on the action.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog would "of course" get a present, according to excerpts of the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama signed up as a fake against her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Of course not, I gave you nice gifts last year", she taunted the president.
Absolutely, did he have to concede before he humorously retorted by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?"
During the one-hour, casual show with the celebrity host who was a staunch supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also reminisced about their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama talked about a 10-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
"I remember the time I met my father, who came to visit us for Christmas and gave me a basketball", the president said.
It wasn't until much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me that ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging it around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house", Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday has had another operation, RTL says he's in an artificial coma.
Johnny Hallyday was operated on in Los Angeles due to significant "injury" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was operated on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after US doctors found "surgical injuries" to the herniated disc he suffered in Paris on November 26, his press service said in Paris, adding that the injuries "needed surgery to repair".
The singer's press service, however, wanted to reassure saying that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical report would be communicated no later than in 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was, however, put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
Asked by AFP, the press service neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no drainage was laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic at Parc Monceau for this herniated disc.
The operation, scheduled for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the art world.
He was not available on Thursday night to comment on RTL news.
Following the surgery he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, for a post-operative infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but assured not to "worry" for the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because flying 12 hours after an operation like that, that's not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had reassured, saying that Johnny Hallyday "was responding satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "contained".
Mr. Camus also said that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of everyone, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had undergone surgery for a "small colon cancer" and then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been heavily commented on, and fans and journalists have noticed the singer's difficulties in moving around on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a further hospitalization.
Euro-2009/petit bassin: the first of Bousquet on his fetish distance
French swimmer Frédérick Bousquet, who won three medals at the 2009 World Championships in the open water, won an international title on Thursday in a distance he particularly loves, the 50 m freestyle, at the Euro 2009 in the small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition, when combinations are allowed for the last time, saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a landslide.
One was bettered by Hungary's Evelyn Verraszto in the 200 m 4 swimming and the other two by Russia in relays gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swimming.
A pity for Bousquet, who was aiming for the world record in the 50 m freestyle, of which he holds the record in the large pool (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m freestyle, it is the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at international level.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world record (20.30) as he had envisioned.
You can always dream of better, and in that case, I said if the world record was within my reach, I was going to try.
Like Bousquet, almost all the swimmers wore polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1st.
The combinations, which have set 238 world records since February 2008, will end their epic run in Istanbul, which hosted the first ones in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the large pool this summer in Rome, world records in the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the record he holds in the 400 m freestyle (3:32.77) but nevertheless won by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give it my all.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann said.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel once owned by French writer Emile Zola was auctioned Thursday for $1.5 million, well above its estimate, art dealer Sotheby's announced.
This two-meter-long, 63-centimeter-high front panel, dating from the third century A.D., was valued at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world", Florent Heintz, vice president of the auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquities at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale is still underway but this lot is certainly the one that buyers have bid on the most so far, a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous Borghese family collection, then appeared successively in the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it part of her bathtub in her Parisian mansion, and in Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
A shadow zone of about 50 years remained.
While searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Succession Emile Zola" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's aborted attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico
Mexico on Thursday ruled that conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe passage by the coup government.
The Commission has also been asked to present a report on the situation in the Community and to make proposals for the establishment of a European police force.
After arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane returned to its original destination, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migration.
The coup government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "resign" and to apply for political asylum abroad to grant him safe passage.
But the deposed president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as the head of state of the country.
The coup government "has failed again in wanting me to resign from office (...), they wanted me to resign", Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, where he has been a frequent speaker since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the deposed president, who has been living in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has submitted a safe-conduct request to us, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, the minister of the interior of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I am not asking for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya had said in an interview with the Caracas-based Telesur television channel.
The European Union is also committed to the development of a democratic society.
Rumours of Zelaya's departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the ousted president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, where the military has reinforced their siege.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
The Commissioner also stressed the need to ensure that the EU's budgetary and budgetary policies were consistent with the objectives of the Lisbon strategy.
Zelaya, who had been close to socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on September 21 and sought refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he is released, he will be arrested and charged with "high treason" by the justice, according to the coup government.
The coup leader Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial ballot, which is recognized by the United States but is contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly to keep Mr. Zelaya in office until his term expired on January 27.
Wall Street is up, US trade balance is on the up, optimism is building
The New York Stock Exchange ended up higher on Thursday, with the US trade balance showing a recovery in both US and its partners' activity: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq rose 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index has risen by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
"We have good news coming from different parts of the economy", said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she said, believing that the market was focused on "the glass half full".
Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, said investors were mostly focused on the US trade balance figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October compared with September, to $32.9 billion.
The analysts, on the other hand, expected a widening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth in the economies of the United States' main trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
By contrast, new jobless registrations in the United States rose more than expected last week to reach 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new jobseekers "has dropped to its lowest level in a year", said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: hundreds of supporters of the government make up the "Ladies in White"
Hundreds of supporters of the Cuban government on Thursday attacked the wives of political prisoners who had gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
Around 40 "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were beaten in the streets by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist noted.
Down with the Yankees! "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" shouted the supporters of the power to the dissidents, with their fists raised.
The women were escorted by plainclothes officers who were "providing protection".
The day before, a similar protest against the Ladies in White was held in Havana, but no one was injured or arrested.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, about ten dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day were arrested by plainclothes police, an AFP journalist noted.
The police forcefully put the dissidents into civilian vehicles which were chased by government supporters, according to the journalist.
The interrogation of dissidents in similar circumstances usually lasts only a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", recipients of the European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize, organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", numbering 200 according to the dissident, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr Maceda was one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain in custody.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
In a rare move, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration by pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European and American NGOs of flouting rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
A man in his 80s is stabbed to death and five people are injured in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A gunman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at a busy hour on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the attacker, aged 28, would have hit with two knives and for unspecified reasons, an octogenarian, in or outside a pharmacy at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, it was learned from police sources and witnesses.
The elderly man, born in 1929, was seriously injured, according to a police union official, and died in hospital from his injuries.
In or in front of that same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, in his 30's, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured and were taken to hospital where the octogenarian died.
The other victim's life is in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then felt unwell and was reportedly hospitalized "in a state of shock", according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then flee into the street, still Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
He allegedly injured two passersby, apparently at random, a man in his 30's and a man in his 40's, the latter seriously.
The script was confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he carried in a cross behind his back, explained on the spot an official of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
According to witnesses gathered by AFP, several passersby, including young people, tried to control the forcibly-injured man.
I saw a guy in his 30s with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They couldn't get in because the guy was big, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd of people attacked him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he said.
Also on Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of no. 61, two municipal police officers, including their leader, tried to intercept the armed man and were injured by punching, according to police sources.
The incident took place in one of the main thoroughfares of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passersby came in and told me there was a wounded person outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old on the ground, I put her in a safe position, and I saw a very large wound on her abdomen, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, in his 30s, arrived, stabbed to death.
The man arrested without identification was a member of the National Police.
The investigation was handed over to the departmental judicial police service of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out that he was committed to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six policemen to bring him under control at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in an over-excited state" like "all the other freaks of this species whose strengths are being increased by the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the prosecution to be dropped
The lawyer for the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski called again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, USA) for the prosecution of his client, who is currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a case of over 30 years of morality.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of "The Pianist", testified before a three-judge panel of the California Court of Appeal for the Second District that there were serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the word 'e' in the word 'f' in the title of the directive.
He said that Judge Rittenband, who has since died, had a discussion with a prosecutor before he sentenced him, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to be sent to prison, which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired", by the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally said at the end of September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to dismiss the case, Mr. Hummel requested a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, that no dismissal of charges could be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentencing, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
He hasn't set foot in the States since.
Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "must be here to testify in court".
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms Asayama.
She said the filmmaker "asks the court for a favor, while disregarding its authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to render their decision -- also pointed out "that there were other alternatives to flight".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to call for the dismissal of Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for the victim, Samantha Geimer, has also called for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client can no longer tolerate being harassed at every turn in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a US warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to reside in his cabin in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.
Wall Street is ending without direction, held back by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without a direction on Friday, in a market torn between better than expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"The market is very calm, honestly", said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "contributed to improving the market's opinion on the strength of the economic recovery", summarised Charles Schwab analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and much more than expected.
Consumer confidence in the United States also rose sharply in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
The indices were held back, however, by a further rise in the dollar, to its highest level in two months against the euro, which "pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market went down.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3,540% from 3,482% on Wednesday night and the 30-year bond to 4,497% from 4,492% the day before.
Miss World South Africa again elected
After a month-long journey through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title are preparing to cross the finish line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great beauty pageant held for the second consecutive year in the outskirts of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their tickets for the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was amazing.
I have seen so much and had so many experiences! exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which is being held for the ninth time in South Africa, is being broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't think of a better place to return my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the austral summer.
For the young Russian, her second visit to South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of gala, rehearsals, press briefings and safari, the Misses are now focused on the competition.
Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and is running for re-election, and Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about looks.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, Miss India crown with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark the 59th edition.
The candidates will be marching in traditional costume and of course in bathing suits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee official Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, went on a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
The Commission has also been asked to provide information on the progress of the negotiations with the United States.
Not unusual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone notes.
Their best memory will probably be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been around people I never thought I'd be able to get close to.
I will definitely be back for the 2010 World Cup, enthuses Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive", his son David said Friday upon his arrival at Los Angeles International Airport where he was due to visit his father who had been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
"He's very strong, he's doing very well", David Hallyday told reporters as he stepped off the plane from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's relaxed-looking son said he would be going "very soon" to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following a herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma last night in Los Angeles for comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment", the press service said.
Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following a herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo another operation on Wednesday night due to extensive injuries resulting from the operation.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is studying on Friday morning to attend a school show, an AFP photographer found.
The head of orthopedic and trauma surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would go to Los Angeles on Monday to see the singer.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the International Clinic of the Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about a possible legal proceeding coming up, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday was "going way too fast to Los Angeles, with the permission of the Paris surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and that had stunned me, considering that I myself had two herniated discs, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he had said that the singer was apparently "parted with no drain, with nothing", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic community.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was working at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to repair a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a notorious reputation, having been repeatedly convicted by the courts in cases of medical liability, as well as for tax fraud and embezzlement.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the order of doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of the order, and who is "far from being commendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He said that the operation had "gone perfectly well" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain", he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have been increasing since this summer, seems to be in the background.
Clearly, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens) as planned, seems very short, said Mr Camus.
The UDF Association raises the bar and calls on the New Centre to stop using its initials
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt of the OPA of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscard party, warning him not to use it on any medium, under penalty of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF, considering that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of the deputy Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP to the NC) who claims the ownership of the UDF trademark for having been the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be dispossessed, broke its silence to issue a formal notice to the minister and the deputy, summoning them to no longer use the logo and to pass on the ownership of the brand, under penalty of legal proceedings.
You have made a number of statements in recent days indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement to "re-take" the UDF acronym, the association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it was good to follow up on your militant material and on the homepage of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Center +, the slogan + the UDF of today +, also note the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this symbol, explains the office of the UDF which reminds the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any media as well as from (its) website".
It also asked Hervé de Charette 'to transfer the ownership of the trade mark to its legitimate heirs'.
If you do not, the courts will be used to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they said that the UDF "has been a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recalled that Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy) symbol.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 for its membership in the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office charged with defending "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
The Office also stated that when Mr de Charette filed the application for registration, he had not been a member of the UDF for three years but had been a member of the UMP.
It is a scandal and a fraud that he is taking advantage of the fact that the acronym UDF is not registered to do so on his behalf.
This lack of tact is becoming a crime, they denounce, before ironizing the NC's strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more dignified to make a name for oneself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one has no right".
The Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier is to be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as accused by the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenaire to spoil part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of power, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a 375,000 euro fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this saga-worthy case about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are torn apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, should be conducted by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not on the terms proposed by the Nanterre public prosecutor's office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday must submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness and at what periods.
I think she'll go along with it.
I will speak to her about it, said Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has been pursuing criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist who is a jack of all trades, accusing him of having taken advantage of his mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt has always denied that she was manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court was considering the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleas sometimes turned to the family's big break on Friday.
For example, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she distrusted the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I haven't been able to talk to her since she got married".
The prosecutor's office in Nanterre again considered that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a judge in the guardianship court had refused in recent days to grant her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in justice, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act for him", said the prosecutor's representative, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court ultimately decided that it would rule after the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of French large companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees has been reminiscent of the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a matter of making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it was in the past, of imposing on consumers products designed by the factory technicians.
By placing the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put market conquest strategies back in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from the factors of customer preferences regularly returns!
The demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the outgrowth of a much more general phenomenon which particularly affects managers.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all intellectual functions of the company, particularly R&D and, even more so, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EIS "requires all stakeholders (...) to be proactive and forward-looking"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that the revenues of authoritarian management are totally opposed.
This is why we are calling for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the centre of the company's concerns as much as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls - such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees - encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
I'm afraid not, though.
- Firstly, because I have observed that, faced with a new situation, every structure finally, after many detours, comes to do as a priority... what it has always done.
- Secondly, because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - grows proportionately to the importance of its own failures.
Well, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
They come from the great engineering schools, and they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviourist theory, recently revived by the American "neuroscience" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to manipulate the "levers" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr reinforces the leaders in a mechanistic governance posture, unsuited to today's world.
Identifying and measuring the factors of mobilisation
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises requires the adoption of a finalist view of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating, in all governance reasoning or practice, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it is clearly seen as a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, only the studies from the Motive-action Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their enterprise on the basis of a predetermined dose which allows them, through their perceived image of the enterprise, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life plans.
By identifying and measuring these mobilisation factors, business managers can monitor, forecast and anticipate their 'social performance' and put their human resource management 'in the right place'.
They thus create a favourable environment for the concerted development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: Obama's "just war" is worthy of praise on the right
The US right wing on Friday welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo the day before, saying it was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate had defended the concept of "just war" against America's enemies.
The conservatives, who had flown the award to Mr Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, as did Sarah Palin, former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said", Palin, a right-wing Republican, told USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the topic of "sometimes necessary" war in her recently published memoir.
War is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to have to do, but it's necessary.
She said that these terrorists had to be stopped.
Obama, who inherited his predecessor George W. Bush's two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, spent Thursday in Oslo justifying the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I thought the speech was really very good, said the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
In some ways, I found this speech quite historic, Mr. Gingrich said in an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former candidate, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a leftist president" remind the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, a former George W. Bush aide turned Washington Post columnist, Mr. Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do little to preserve it", said Mr Gerson.
Among the few on the right who were not convinced, a hawk of the Bush era, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "deadening, bombastic and uninspiring" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When war is wrapped up in the notion of justice, it can easily be justified in the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained eloquent about the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was prematurely awarded to Mr. Obama, called his speech "a super-production" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map for international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the California newspaper wrote.
Mr. Obama "gave the speech he needed", said the New York Times, calling it "dark and edifying at the same time".
Roadsters: three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road unions and the TLF, the only employers' organisation to have stayed to the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ends the strike order and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" at this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of the agreement quickly by the end of the morning.
This was despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting that started at 11:00 a.m. for everyone to agree and at 6:00 p.m. the text was signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "there was a fear that it would disrupt the end-of-year celebrations", Mr Bussereau said.
The text provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest paid (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest paid (international transport).
The hourly rate for low-wage workers is being reduced from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It is not much, but we have come a long way, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we give the order to our militants that there are no blockades, no blockades of the supply centers.
But there can always be some recalcitrants who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to concede the increases on high salaries in view of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros a month for low-wage workers and 100 to 120 euros for the highest-wage workers.
The agreement was a compromise between common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
The Commission's proposal was to be submitted to the Council.
The agreement also provides for the increase in travel costs by 3% and the general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible to address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a €100 million reduction in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance bill for 2009, voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in the same terms".
The signature of the TLF enables the agreement to apply initially to the companies belonging to this organization and, in the second stage, to the whole profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
The Commission's proposal was to be submitted to the Council by the end of the year.
Opposition from employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "deceitful market", as the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in a hurry, not as a conclusion to a shared analysis, but to avoid upsetting the turkey-eaters of the next Christmas Eve, lamented Unostra.
The other said that the agreement "could be the death knell for a very large number of SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions unhappy with RATP's proposals
The disruptions on the RER A, France's largest urban public transportation line, will continue over the weekend, as a meeting on Friday on the second day of the strike between the unions and the RATP management has left them on their hunger for their premium demand.
On Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10:00 and 20:00, at the rate of one train out of two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is making efforts to serve the department stores".
The RER A runs west through the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran during peak hours, and almost no trains during off-peak hours, as expected.
As on Thursday, there was no commotion on the docks, as the French organized themselves.
In the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, mainly because of the absence of students and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, said that he got up "a half hour earlier to make sure he got there on time".
The train station of Saint-Lazare was not saturated, according to the SNCF, which had planned a staffing of agents and law enforcement.
RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
Further general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday to discuss the results, deemed "meager" by the unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a fair premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its bonus proposals in parentheses, the CGT was indignant, stressing that the management "was not in a position to solve a problem whereas the road hauliers and the SNCF have done so".
A further meeting is scheduled for Monday to "examine more broadly the conditions of the profession", RATP said.
This also led the unions to say that the company "made fun of weekend users".
By morning, some 150 motorists had stormed a settlement committee at headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, which had refused to discuss the strike until then, suggested the meeting "in order to appease the situation".
The conflict threatens to spread to RER B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions are demanding a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the daily million of passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second half of their careers, receive a gross of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and bonuses of 600 to 650 euros for shiftwork on Sundays and holidays.
Turkey's courts dissolve pro-Kurdish party, decision with heavy consequences
Turkey's constitutional court on Friday dissolved the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry protests in the Kurdish community in the country's southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "focus of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", the Court's President Hasim Kiliç told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision was made unanimously by all 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's cadres, including its chairman Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in the parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as un-labelled MPs.
The decision follows a 2007 case brought by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, insists it has "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to label it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's ruling comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights in an attempt to stem Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had claimed that a dissolution could lead to a renewed escalation of tensions in Southeastern Anatolia, where numerous protests against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have escalated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
As soon as the justice was announced, a thousand protesters gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, the large city in the southeast of the country with a majority of Kurds.
Police fired tear gas and water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails and stones with fronds.
A hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk said that the court's decision would "deepen the despair".
The European Union is also committed to the development of the internal market and to the promotion of the free movement of goods.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed to the closure of political parties.
This is not a solution, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete torpedoing of the democratic opening initiated by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
He also called for the EU to be involved in the negotiations with the countries of the region.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow may fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very harsh winter.
But the head of the road cleaning and sanding service (FES) clarifies that this is not to annoy citizens.
It's simply so that the agents can test the vehicles' technology and learn how to master them.
And according to the weatherman, it could be as early as this weekend.
Over 300 officers and 120 vehicles are standing by to tackle the snow and ice.
The FES is following a very elaborate plan here.
Mr Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow in the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travel along 20 main routes (called routes A).
This includes the high traffic streets, the main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES officers start their shift at three in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with road salt that adheres well, in a maximum of 3 hours.
This is why the FES service starts at 3am "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic starts".
The hardest part is when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This is a problem, says the head of the road cleaning and sanding department, "because no motorists are willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, when the snow is gone, we take care of the access roads and the access roads - like the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger knows that there are always some complaints about this.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES's foot team sets off to identify the areas deemed dangerous and the crossings as a priority.
As for the cycle paths, the FES services are generally not able to take care of them.
Mr Brauburger said that there is a special service in Frankfurt which monitors the condition of bridges between 10pm and 4.30am.
As ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles are called upon as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees Celsius.
The police also sometimes call upon this special service in case of need.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: it was about 2 meters long and 1.5 meters high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was equipped with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended in sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues report in Thursday's Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to exhibit these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then part of the upper land of the supercontinent Pangea, and was located near the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
It provides information about the relationships, distribution, and characteristics of the family.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt began excavating with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Natural History Museum of Utah and a member of the excavation team says that they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating back to the Triassic.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
Excavations have uncovered the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that supports theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi word for the sun god.
Sterling Nesbitt called the find exceptional: fossils of dinosaurs from the Triassic period are extremely rare, limited to a few fragments of incomplete bones.
Not all paleontologists share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not think that the discovery is particularly spectacular, but he does say that it confirms some theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making classification of the earliest dinosaurs very difficult.
Experts wonder when the saurians split into three major evolutionary groups: the theropods (carnivores), which include the later tyrannosaurs and velociraptors, from which birds descended; the sauropods, long-necked quadrupeds and their relatives; and the ornithischians, which include species such as the triceratops and the stegosaurs.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and colleagues, the Tawa is one of the earliest theropods.
This species has an interesting mix of both primitive and developed features, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found evidence that suggests the Tawa hallae had small air sacs in their skull bones, just like the birds that are the descendants of theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe than for mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the huge sauropods also possessed air sacs and a lightweight skeleton, it can be assumed that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
Since the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers have concluded that the saphenous snake originated there.
So the three great lines of evolution split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, which is the whole of the emergent land that was the supercontinent of Pangea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the paleontology team also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot have descended from a common ancestor who migrated, the researchers suggest.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of the magazine Science Studies says that there have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Paleontologist Martin Sander in Bonn says that there is an even older species, the silesaurus, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to the dinosaurs.
He said this could be misleading because there are a lot of dinosaur fossils preserved in South America, and there are almost none on other continents.
But how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapod of the Second Age from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch is still a mystery.
In the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and many other saurians.
By the end of the Triassic dinosaurs had spread across the planet, fostering the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not permanent.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction in which dinosaurs survived in a random way while other reptiles would have died out.
Or maybe dinosaurs were better adapted and so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
Such success is not permanent.
150 million years later, a meteorite fell on a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and that had since then been in the shadows: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, and Berkeley, California.
There are those of lecturers from the Universities of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the casino at the J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt is making waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers from the J.W. Goethe University and other institutions of higher education in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they condemned the police intervention requested by the university's governing committee.
Last week, the university president, Werner Müller-Estler, ordered the evacuation of the buildings occupied by the striking students and teachers after walls and artworks were smeared with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories feel that the damage did not justify "such violent intervention by the police commando against the students and teachers who had organized their own classes".
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable infringement" of freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and attempts to make people forget the reasons for the mobilization.
The University Board thus avoided the debate that would have been necessary.
The court officials demand that the criminal proceedings be suspended immediately.
Most of the occupants had no part in the damage.
Legitimacy of the protests
The youth of the service sector union Green and the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) stand in solidarity with the students.
The protests are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Science of the State of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took the case for the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the regional parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday during the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU is using a few painted walls as a pretext to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the students' arguments and demands, we're evacuating them.
The Left Party has tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the conditions of the police intervention.
The new Silicon Valley
For a long time it had the reputation of being a secret city, closed to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was a secret weapons research site under strict surveillance during the Soviet period.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has a reputation as the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important micro- and nanoelectronics production and research facilities are located there.
As early as September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd established links with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg  and with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a  Protocol of Close Collaboration.
The signatories were the deputy mayor of Moscow Yuri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will enable FIZ companies to enter the rapidly expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific societies are interested in obtaining contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
The Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the large firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika are located here.
The town was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist town" for armament research.
Zelenograd (literal translation  Green City ) takes its name from the forested hills in the heart of which the research centres are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project is unfathomably large.
For its supporters it is nothing less than the new heart of Europe.
If you want to. S21, it's much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, in a desperate chaos of construction sites for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
The railway stations, with tracks ending in the middle of the city, were reputed at the time to be the relics of 19th century transport technology that were the brake blocks of modern rail traffic because it took a long time to get the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure  that's what you have to do.
That is why the mainline stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a train station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Main Line between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realisation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long since become incompatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, the mainline stations no longer pose any real problems of entering and exiting since there are modern, reversible trains with autorels and driver cars at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched alongside the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and local policies have won.
The railway company is part of the problem because it is the taxpayer who pays the cost of the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public company.
From the urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
You get an urban space that - if you believe the computer-generated planners' graphics - will be very green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The passing station and the extension of the section are designed for a traffic of people to which - and this is typical of the 1980s - enormous growth was attributed.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport by truck.
But the new line, with its slopes, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly affects many other railway projects.
For example, €6 billion will be spent on the Swabia project.
That's the official figure.
Some experts believe that ten to fifteen billion is more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be lacking for other interconnection and congestion points in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions 60 major projects in all.
One of the most important is the extension of the section across the Rhine valley by a good 180 kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the mushroom here all the way.
But the S21 project is a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley route is becoming a bottleneck for international goods traffic in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews airport ruling
In the regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land government raised the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court concerning the ban on night flights.
The Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine the Administrative Tribunal's judgment from a legal point of view, which is a document of over 400 pages.
The Kassel Court had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations on the prohibition of night flights in the event that the project for the construction of the north-west runway at Frankfurt airport was implemented.
The authorization to land 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nighttime air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 whether it wishes to appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticises this delay and tries to put pressure on the government representative to withdraw from the appeal before the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, calls on the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which was to ban night flights, otherwise this will be considered a total breach of a given promise.
It is very difficult to be allowed to keep your word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our promises".
Minister Posch refuted the accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel that the Land government was still trying to authorize night flights by using "avocational and blatant methods".
It takes time to do a thorough legal review.
The coalition doesn't want to make a decision based on a "quick first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of its group on the prohibition of night flights is completely wrong.
US banks reimburse the aid
The big American banks, hit hard by the crisis, are cutting off their ties to the state.
Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had paid back $45 billion in full to the Treasury, matching the aid provided under the TARP bailout.
The US television channel CNBC reported that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
The banking institutions are thus seeking to get rid of the restrictions imposed on the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonuses to executives and the payment of higher fees.
Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in fresh cash.
The remainder of the sum comes from the bank's coffers which are well filled up by the sale of several branches in other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis specifically thanked the American taxpayer: the capital injection has helped tremendously to get through a difficult time.
The bank had presumed its ability to buy out the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup also plans to raise money on the financial markets to free itself from the State's tutelage.
The US bank could launch a capital increase of $20 billion as early as Thursday, CNBC reported, citing banking circles.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment on the report.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Eventually, it all happened sooner than I expected.
Only two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the board of the German broadcaster ZDF, the successor has already been appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin-based ZDF newsroom, was the big favourite.
The channel did not, however, wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also a desire not to further harm the steward of the ZDF, Markus Schächter, in the event that the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the votes of nine out of 14 members of the Commission.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the time of the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend the contract of Nikolaus Brender for five years but this had been rejected.
Only seven members of the Council voted in favour of Brender's re-election, and seven voted against it.
The CDU, which has a majority on the Board of Directors, had already indicated several weeks before the vote that it did not want to reinstate Brender.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Hessian Land who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief on the grounds that the ratings of ZDF news programmes had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost up to the vote, denouncing the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 public law experts who intervened in the debate and who considered that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it would have been no use.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked for the Südwestfunk (radio organ of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily newspaper of national scope).
In 1983 he became editor of the ZDF, first of all in the current affairs magazine "heute-journal" (today's newspaper).
From 1988 to 1990 he was deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of "Morgenmagazins" (bi-monthly news show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was head of the foreign policy department of ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial office.
After the disgrace of Brender, who had just been named journalist of the year by the magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint against the government.
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate, Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF's Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partisan political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to ask for the withdrawal of the political personalities who are members of the ZDF supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had deftly maneuvered the board of directors by vehemently criticizing the board in its decision to fire Brender.
This evidence of journalistic independence enabled Schächter to nominate him for the position of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without suspicion of placing a political party member in the position.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as left-liberal.
The Great Cleansing in University Education
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to show more conciliation: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors' Conference, an agreement was reached stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor's and Master's students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the burden of examinations: a single examination must be sufficient to complete the chosen study module.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
The political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed themselves to organizing more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master courses.
At the regional level, there should be no different regulations from one Land to another.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have been constantly using the phrase "studiability".
But for the first time, the phrase seems to have a practical meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to reduce the number of certain examinations considerably: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", reads a document of some thirty pages on the future conditions for admission to university courses.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, stated that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations it should be possible to stop the slippage which was seriously affecting the studying ability.
In future, the 'studiability' should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies.
The modules as well as the background should be examined carefully to see if the feeling of suffocation sometimes experienced in choosing courses can be avoided.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest information in the RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the scope to enable and encourage personal initiative".
The new regulations will concern access to new university courses but will also be adapted to existing courses.
These cycles must be 're-accredited' every 5 years, which means, however, that all the cycles will have been examined only in 2015.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which are dependent on the accreditation councils set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to put pressure on the agencies so that the curricula were not overburdened and the examination system not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land to have agreed to allocate more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities should organise tutoring programmes and reinforce guidance offices as well as examination offices and the international relations service.
The Länder and universities are providing a budget of EUR 10 million for this purpose.
In early 2010, the government wants to table an amendment to the Law on Higher Education Institutions in Parliament.
After that, only one final examination is required.
The organisation of studies should be more flexible, the recognition of transcripts from other higher education institutions should be guaranteed and access to the Master's degree should be simplified.
By the end of next year, the 'studiability' of all university courses will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of educational conditions in the country.
The decisions were welcomed, but criticism was voiced.
The Federal President of the Socialist Students' Union has said that he would like to see the organization of educational policy no longer take place in the future "behind closed doors" of Ministers and university rectors.
By the time the student strike is over, the students as concerned should be able to speak a little.
The future graduates of higher education received support from the President of the Rectors' Conference (HRK) delegates, Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful to us", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
The decisions taken in Bonn are not far enough for the Union of Education and Science (GEW), which demands the right and the possibility for every Bachelor's graduate to enrol in a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW steering committee, also asked that the Länder ensure that today's Bachelor students will have enough places for Master studies and the best possible study conditions.
The Länder therefore have to hire more lecturers.
The Ministers of Education, however, did not discuss the possibility of facilitating access to the Master's.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
With these words  Arrived in Germany and it's beautiful, almost more control...  the poet Werner Söllner begins a work in which he discusses in a few troubling sentences the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany and gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and then a collection manager in a publishing house for young people before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has received various literary prizes; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at Frankfurt's Goethe University and since 2002 he has been director of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm artist house in Frankfurt.
He was the subject of much discussion in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a conference in Munich, whose theme was "German Literature in Romania in the Mirror and the Deforming Mirror of Your Securitate Files".
Visibly unstable and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the political police Securitate.
Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989 jointly with some of the participants.
The enrolment trials had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, someone who has not been able to resist the intimidation of the Securitate sufficiently.
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her exemplary literary encounters with the mechanisms of the dictatorship's power, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abysses and the baseness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from the current knowledge, not only the culprit but also the victim.
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, literary scholar Michael Markel assures after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favour.
He could have pulled it out of all the tough situations at the time, according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and to this audience was unexpected, however the admission by a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is actually not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate, wrote Herta Müller in the newspaper Die Zeit in July, after reading the 914 pages of her own case file.
It is possible that the victims have speculated and sometimes guessed which real names were last hidden the names of borrowers Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to Germany, where consultation of Stasi files is now a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
Systematic enlightenment has been continually thwarted and held back in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Securitate archives (CNSAS) but the return of the files has been rather delayed since then.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high is confirmed by an interview with a former Securitate official from Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, spoke very contemptuously of the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and in the end, she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any fear, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Admittedly, many inescapable questions are associated with the Söllner case as it so often occurs in a context of hidden guilt.
The balanced reaction of the audience to Söllner's confession suggests that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Riots at the Champions League
It seemed as if a representative had arrived, dragged straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread its goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross got on at a quarter to midnight in a Mercedes C-class, which he had just called, carrying an orange plastic bag from the supplier.
The man, whose bald head attracted attention, let himself be led into the city, which was still unknown to him.
Otherwise our 50-year-old would have been able to drive himself - he hadn't drunk alcohol and he wasn't drunk with happiness either.
He had a nice evening, but tomorrow we had to go back to work.
Because now it was going to start.
The words of the Swiss player who had just been signed three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the round of 16" - that is, the Champions League thanks to our 3-1 win against Romania's Unirea Urziceni - "but we must not be blinded by success.
We're going to the "hard work" on Sunday.
The aim is to repeat the results of the Champions League in Mainz on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that resurfaced after the three goals of Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing of lots
The draw for the quarter-finals of the Champions League (first leg 16./17. + 23./24 February/reverse match 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be held on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the sudden entrance into office of Babbel's successor was therefore tempered.
And the joy was not only moderated by the lucky man who had given the unstable Stuttgart professionals unfailing motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to the players and told them that they should concentrate on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "plumber of souls"  Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so good but which no longer worked with Dr Babbel.
It has triggered a certain magic, said Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "in football when there is a new impulse, things sometimes happen that we would never have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who after weeks of injury break, rose to the rank of best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the proverbial "cool wind" phenomenon and the new boss's working method: "He is someone who goes to action and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation.
But apparently Babbel had run out of it.
VfB Stuttgart have not yet crossed the line, warns manager Horst Heldt
Right now, VfB Stuttgart needs more than tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before they had a bad wake-up call four days later in Leverkusen with 0: 4, Khedira objected.
The manager, Horst Heldt, said that they had achieved one of their goals for the season, but that they had others that were still far off.
We haven't crossed the hard part yet.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday had no heart to celebrate, even after the first home victory in three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a televised interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann caused to bounce off just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered in response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the management of a lack of style and said that she had decided to change coaches under pressure from teenage fans.
Lehmann also considered that the fact that his day off after matches had been taken away was a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmann's statements were marked by pure selfishness, and he blamed Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
There was no longer any chance of these two 40-something's becoming lifelong friends.
In all other respects, they were in agreement that without the prior work of the replaced coach, the strong sporting and combative team would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were  largely responsible for the success  replied Heldt and Lehmann in chorus  and even the man with the plastic bag agreed.
Heavyweight Championship of the World
The challenge was a hot one in Bern: Kevin Johnson, the challenger, constantly challenged the world champion Vitali Klitschko, verbally and gesturally.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
The judges unanimously awarded him the points.
Hamburg  Vitali Klitschko retains his title as the heavyweight champion of the world.
The WBC announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a unanimous judges' point victory over American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won the WBO and WBC world championship twice.
Unfortunately, he didn't get the long-awaited knockout.
Klitschko, who won 39 of his 41 professional bouts, was twice beaten by injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Arena of Bern, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, from the height of 2.02 meters, by his left side.
Johnson, eleven centimetres shorter than Klitschko, who had announced the end of the duel, managed to avoid the champion's blows, preventing Klitschko from entering the game against his dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to challenge Klitschko in words and gestures, his punches only very rarely reached the champion.
He is the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, to have crossed the distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him a "bad zombie" who "isn't really capable".
During Friday's weigh-in, the champion couldn't help but tease Johnson by knocking his sunglasses off his nose so he could see his eyes.
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, defending his title, he won against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just got a kick in this fight and I'm in perfect shape", Klitschko said explaining his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to unite the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is the WBO and IBF champion.
But it is the British David Haye who, having beaten the great Nikolai Waluyev - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko that was supposed to take place in September.
It seems his promoter is now considering playing the game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz Affair
Opposition frontal attack: The leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused Defence Minister Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz Affair.
The SPD and the Left (die Linke) parties are asking the Chancellor for an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest intelligence on the airstrike in Kunduz, the opposition has accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The minister intentionally "formulated a falsehood" about the deadly attack on two tankers last September, said the leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 20h).
In other words, it means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
The EU should also be able to take part in the negotiations on the EU's future with the United States.
Last Friday, new media reports revealed that the purpose of the raid was not really to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two prominent Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured in the US airstrike which was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak to the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate Künast are of the opinion that Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the strategy of targeted massacres is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government if the chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery had no influence on the military's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were growing louder to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to the information provided by SPIEGEL, the information they had given to Guttenberg about the tanker attack was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden from the Minister some embarrassing details.
The two senior officials' entourage, however, suggest that they informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a military police report.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert has since written to the police to clarify the facts.
So far, he hasn't gotten a response.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not wish to comment on these allegations and referred the matter to the inquiry committee of the Federal Parliament, which was to be set up the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dreams
Some people, when awake, see images and hear voices that no one else can see or hear.
It is not only in the case of the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs that the boundaries between imagination and reality become blurred.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our darkened rooms, we can indulge unhindered in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who, awake, experiences the dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices are not confined to the mentally ill or to the drugged.
It's our imagination that's at work: it's the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paint paintings, and write novels, but that sometimes pushes the boundaries between dream, madness, and reality to blur.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most varied forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, in the worst of cases madness.
But even though the trigger and the effect are distinct, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, the psychosis and the hallucinations are all attributable to very similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is disturbed and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts are very common during schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of gravity on Earth no longer has any power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and physicians have always studied the relationship between madness and dreaming.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-waking; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It's the autumn of 2001 and Henning T is transformed into a cartoon character.
Its body is two-dimensional in vivid colors.
Earth's gravity no longer has any power over him, he's floating right up to the ceiling.
He's feeling a blow.
Behind him, winged devil creatures, grimacing, mouths drenched in blood, showing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with the heavy flaming boots, throw him against the wall, he feels pain all over his body.
Thunderous, mean, screaming voices coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can't stand these voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. rips two wires from his stereo chain, makes a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He's riding on a buffalo and wearing the noose around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop is coming off.
Let this be a lesson to you, the voices in a choir are shouting to tear out his eardrum, "Go to a clinic and get treated!"
Henning T. is 40 years old today, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
He's diagnosed as schizo-affective, paranoid, and he's also manic-depressive, and he's on medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives; in psychiatric clinics it is the second most common disorder after depression.
In a schizophrenic crisis, the affected person can no longer tell the difference between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitation, which can cause them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned in sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the floodgates to a flood of ideas and fantasies from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the psychiatry department at the Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is at the very center of the situation, all of it with a meaning centered on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is as in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot act on them actively.
That's why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they have no possibility of adjusting to reality, illusions are a cruel reality, awakening is out of the question.
To experience a hallucination for once in your life.
Unlike dreams, Fuchs says, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experienced takes place in a real setting.
Why our brains do this kind of thing is still a puzzle to researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause a person to lose momentarily the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the people affected have minor brain damage.
It is thought that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the abnormality of the neural system occurs and, moreover, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or a traumatic experience may be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains are heating up.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others buy expensive drugs to get their hands on them.
The perception of illusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusional imagery for ten years and last year published his findings in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Minds".
Hallucinations are one of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and head trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy persons are prone to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They form when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not restrained enough; when our brain is heated up but also when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state just like brain damage or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulation, stress, heartbreak or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants admit to having experienced a hallucination at least once in their life.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and she goes to high school.
A girl who's pretty much normal, actually.
If there were no images and voices.
At recess, a young, thin, long-haired, brown-haired boy would talk to her.
When she answers, her classmates look at her, surprised that no one else sees or hears the boy.
They think this shy girl is a dreamy lunatic but Sarah K. is not dreaming, she's sure of it.
She's awake, hearing and seeing this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even sense his presence for a moment.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young man sympathetic.
"Am I mad?" she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night, apparitions are usually frightening.
The visions are often heavy.
When she's in class, she can't follow the lesson because the teacher is just introducing a new student to her eyes and ears while he's invisible to others and the teacher is clearly explaining equations to the table.
At night, apparitions are usually frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too seldom and too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimacing faces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs, are before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she shouts to those creatures.
She doesn't tell her parents or her friends, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has been in contact with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or lacks sufficient stimulation, the likelihood of hallucinations is high after a certain amount of time.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so it makes sure there's some animation.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 years old that the man she had called dad, ever since she was old enough to think, was not her real father.
These are the same areas of the brain that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for actual impressions and sounds, so it's very difficult for people like Sarah K to tell the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience", according to Kasten "is in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that are formed in the brain, which is why they seem so real".
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only one step between dreaming and hallucinating.
In our world, which is too conscious, we unfortunately tend to mistake imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but it also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience known as oniroid, a particular form of altered consciousness awakened by dreams.
Oneiroid experiences are highly complex semi-dreams which are perceived as real by the person experiencing them and which he cannot distinguish from the dream even when he is in a waking state.
The state of oniroid consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies such as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, but experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a mental boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation which is intolerable in itself, a capacity for organization which is given to us, to us men, so as not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
It's all real even in later memories.
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his dreamlike experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a soul-saving action.
He is 49 years old, and at the time of his departure, he is conscious and on a journey of several days after a heart valve operation followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain immobile in intensive care.
Claussen immerses himself in a world he has created from scratch, visiting strange places, travelling through time, and seeing himself as an old man in a railway sanatorium, with a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages amongst nobles who manufacture narcotics from blood.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorcycle driver who takes him back to his country, surfs his hospital bed in the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He becomes completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
"The dream is a very different state", he writes, describing what he experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely vivid and highly detailed even years later.
They are even more distinct and intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the unerotic delusions, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in the waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can cause a distortion of what we call reality".
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snow may fall
Burda
At 27, the kids will take over the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of Burda publishing is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly determined to integrate into society, said Hubert Burda, 69, to Spiegel.
All the details were worked out in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
We'll also have to see if they're capable of it.
You can't put your kids in front of 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
It would destroy the children as well as the company.
Burda announced last Thursday that he would step down as CEO in January and that his successor would be Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first in charge of the technology sector.
He was subsequently responsible for the treasury, i.e. the company's capital, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's departure he also took over the marketing, foreign, printing and finance departments.
So for the first time it is not a family member who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old respectively, her son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the link for the next 10 or 15 years".
Burda says the holding company must remain 100% in the family's hands.
Ruins have always been in the hands of families who have been driven by a capital bulimia, who have made huge, unfortunate speculations thinking they could always climb higher.
That was never my strategy.
I've never had a dream about universal power, said Burda.
I don't see myself in the role of a national tutor like Springer could be and I don't intend to be in those international leagues like Time, these companies have become far too important.
The beauty of integrity
Everything you could ever want in terms of beauty and well-being, right at your fingertips.
This is what seems to be the goal of El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the Callao shopping centre (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 devoted to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, a specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation and beauty treatment rooms, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a sports room, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, with a special tea room, which offers over 130 different kinds of tea.
Spaxion offers you a relaxing massage with your partner, while enjoying the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent the relax zone for two hours to organise your own  Beauty Party  with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and a glass of champagne.
In total, there are 250 m2 spread over 12 rooms, where the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments can be used.
Like cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual coaches who guide the steps of the clients, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos show us how to do our exercise program correctly.
His director says that 15 minutes (including warm-ups and stretching) is enough to get all the muscles working.
And if, after having worked our body, we want to go through the hairdressing salon, the brand Luis & Tachi has a room where hair repair rituals, lighting or nutrition are offered, all customized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the keywords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Various types of cut
Christmas is coming and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to fit it to our festive wardrobe.
The shape of the heel, which is very important for emphasizing the figure, is one of the variables we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated neckline.
Endesa and Barcelona, the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, has created the Oficina LIVE.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The Oficina LIVE (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will implement agreements on mobility, by making proposals, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, and gather the views and work of the sectors involved.
The idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3  electric cities 
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
The latter include energy-related activities, particularly energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa is involved in promoting the electric car.
The company is part of European-level standardisation groups and has a number of complementary projects under way such as G4V, ELVIRE and CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees  a future of tranquility  for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, envisaged a "peaceful future" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he said, constituted the country's main export sector.
In presenting the 2009 Economic Report of the Prime Minister, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
 Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, we would today have a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production sites,  said the President of the Government.
 Thanks to this plan and the brands' decision to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can look forward to a future of peace for the industry, which is our main export sector, he added.
In this context, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the Automotive Industry Integral Plan (AIP), has allocated EUR 800 million to projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiaries, which have mobilised an investment of more than EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government measures to support demand, referring to the Plan 2000E, set up in collaboration with the autonomous communities and the automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a 'strong increase' in registrations, which rose by '40%' in November.
20,000 m2 of collector cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Collection Car Show, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
The exhibition area covers 20 000 m2, and will feature more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
In addition to motorcycles and classic cars, ClassicAuto Madrid will also feature all kinds of motoring-related items.
The exhibitors at the pavilion will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures and so on.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the collecting engine that will delight collectors and curious people.
The companies taking part include Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in car sales, Juan Lumbreras, specialists in catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, specialists in car sales and catering, and Cochera Clásicos, specialists in Mercedes Benz.
Outdoor aptitude test
The trade fair will also include side activities: meetings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Competition tests with vintage cars and motorcycles will also be held on a track outside the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: a long-lasting sports spirit
Mazda wants to prove that the spirit of sport is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, into the Mazda3, a device that, at least for the time being, is only available on the 150-horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is distinguished by the good overall rating it has received.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are remarkable in the new Mazda3.
Starting from the driver's seat, the front seats are found to have excellent ergonomics and seating.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the control panel and console ensemble, we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright red and blue colours.
This style is reminiscent of the Honda Civic in some ways.
This is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, stand in contrast to the sobriety of German products, and more particularly to the Volkswagen Golf, which they all want to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough seating capacity to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition, there is a large, regularly shaped chest.
The automatic engine start and stop system, at least for the time being, is only available on the two-litre 150 hp petrol engine with manual shifting of the six gears.
The engine is a real success, distinguished by its finesse, low noise, performance and controlled consumption.
Although the most popular Mazda3s are diesel models, those with a low mileage should not be excluded from the i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and its controlled consumption.
As regards the equipment level, the model chosen for the test is the Sport, i.e. the one with the largest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipment, the lane change assistant (RVM) which eliminates blind spot, traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, the independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio, as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly noteworthy.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for 1 500 euros more, includes among other elements of the bi-xenon adaptive headlights and a BOSE audio system with a disc charger.
The conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly distinguished by the quality of the materials used, its performance and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive many kilometres a year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version, which is only available with the 150-horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which ranges from 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this substantial sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
 First  of luxury

Our  Pe , as sophisticated as she was, had opted for a  dark lady .
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at your email, without offering even the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named it one of the products of the year.
It's actually harder to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half the cost of, for example, the iPhone data subscription.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as its American counterpart, but it's got a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or to desperately search for a cafeteria on Wifi (or a phone connection) to be able to consult your mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and should have worked for a long time.
Some operators do have special agreements and travel options, but for me, I would need a degree in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated calls for affordable roaming charges across Europe have had little effect.
Outside of their country of origin, people are reluctant to use the data, and they're right.
The fact that a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it has no Wifi) offers this type of tariff means that operators are beginning to think differently and are looking at different proposals to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other Internet searches.
No subscription and no galley.
It is a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not every month.
And that's what I hope to see someday for FonPeek: a lifetime access purchase option like Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm just checking my mail on my phone, thank you.
I simply wish it because I believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer that has this same system.
Michelle's favorite color is
Yellow is, without a doubt, the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama's inauguration as President of the United States in a dress and a coat of this colour, she has in fact chosen the same one to accompany him in the second, undoubtedly the most important moment of his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar design on both occasions: in addition to their similar colour, a yellow-to-green with bright reflections, both times the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So, at first glance, it would appear that the First Lady of the United States is following in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to wear the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If the official date was a thick lace, she wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heels for the first occasion, and a similar model, but this time golden.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised up whereas it was loose the last time.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generation who want to be mothers.
This is the finding of the study 'Fertility and professional career of women in Spain', carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, which was carried out on 9 737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their professional careers limited by maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of married life and the number of children, whether the woman works or not and the type of employment occupied.
Those who have no activity outside the home, part-time work or have a job with a shaky work schedule, are more likely to get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women in stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay marriage and first pregnancy and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling into a relationship.This figure rises to 4.1 for those working in the public sector. These data show that women with stable jobs have needed more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to postpone marriage and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work done has a major influence on maternity, but less on the date of the beginning of a common life, explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that increases the gap between the age at which women marry and the age at which they have their first child.
The survey found that the higher the level of education, the later they get married and have their first child.
The difference also persists among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with primary and higher education respectively became mothers for the first time at an average age of 25.1 and 32.1 years.
 Another distinction is also made between women, according to their level of education.
While those with a primary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with a secondary education reverse this pattern and prioritise the acquisition of a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child", says Ms Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has added a new name to its long-awaited list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the face of several of the brand's products, singing the universal motto "Because I'm worth it".
The star of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, joins other celebrities registered with L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish actress Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this exclusive club were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
The brand also has luxury ambassadors for men: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, Anatomy Lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
The price of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its most important representatives, designers and models, past and present, gathered for the annual awards ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, named Model of the Year.
The poker ace of Manuel Vincent
In Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente), Manuel Vincent offers us some thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He does not do this in the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the core of the character's creation.
The journey is exciting and Vincent is not spared from the horrors and the illuminations.
A delightful treat, this book is also a moving invitation to read and reread.
I'll leave you with a few snapshots.
About Albert Camus:  In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, impulse, the same one that I felt without naming it: pleasure against a fateful fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god. 
About Samuel Beckett:  Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between helplessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him 
Our man was inspired by this woman, by a passion that lasted 13 years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven by the path of perdition.
About James Joyce:  Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-thousand-meter peaks of world literature, which must be climbed from the north face, on which the best mountaineers still let go and take. 
William Faulkner: He was a strange man.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both of these dreams were grand.
This writer took the cry that Munch's character had raised from a bridge to echo deep into the night of the 20th century, in its literary form, and he did so in the flight from himself and by invoking the post-war with a violent speech to the maggots.
About Dorothy Parker:  One day she got down on her knees and prayed:  Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman. 
On Joseph Conrad:  On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser:  Sleep after the effort, / after the storm the harbor, / rest after the war, / after life, tired death delighted. 
Virginia Wolf: In her luggage she carried her depressions too.
Her husband would quite normally accept her telling him that Edward VII was sleeping among azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never did we see a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent outweighed her madness.
What did Martín-Santos do except try to hide Joyce at Baroja's?
What was Benet trying to do but have Faulkner shoot Baroja?
What did it do but to covet the glory of this man so that it would serve as a pedestal for him ?
A cowardly attack
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood in the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a male, rescued from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they kicked her twice, leaving the dog seriously injured.
We are very angry because we do not see what is funny in attacking a small, defenceless animal for free, which was also on a leash.
In addition, there is the indignation of a lady who was walking around in peace and who, when she insulted these individuals, became afraid for her physical integrity, since an energy-madman who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, anyone weaker than him.
The incident took place at about 5 p.m., a typical Tuesday, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog has been moaning all day.
We have lodged a complaint with the local police station, although we doubt that it will help much and in order not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
We were outraged and denounced the incident.
We do not understand what is happening to young people to make it fun to mistreat a helpless animal who gives us affection, friendship and company.
We don't know where good manners and respect for animals and people have gone.
Other, of a capacity of 50 l or more
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as both organisations announced today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only protection element that can prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeler accident.
Michelin said that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which goes beyond designing and manufacturing ever safer products, and that it contributed to this objective through other educational and informational actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of two-wheel helmets, under the slogan  To be or not to be , will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is a constant concern for the company, as one of its main objectives as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheelers is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles increase
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the manufacturers' employers' union Anfac and Ganvam, the dealers' union.
However, the good news is that the comparison benchmark in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the upturn in the last month, the accumulated registrations in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles falling under the category of light commercial vehicles (passenger car derivatives, pick-up trucks, vans, light vans and light-frame trucks) are added together, 95,853 have been sold.
The big clouds that most affect demand have not disappeared, because although they are also bought by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100% of the time with external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by the limitation of bank credit, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation must be added.
In view of this situation and the different type of passenger cars, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E was of little use.
In addition to private individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs wishing to purchase a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre can also benefit from this, but the number of transactions speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we again recalled the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers' association forecasts a year 2010 similar to the one that is coming to an end, for which it calculates a fall in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4s) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As was the case with the anti-lock brake system ABS and as will be the case with ESP, emergency brake assist systems will be a mandatory feature on European cars.
The new rules are already mandatory for newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a grace period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to improve the protection of pedestrians, although, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear-end collisions.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system through the driver's foot.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure on until the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, one third of drivers involved in an accident had failed to apply the brake before the collision, and half had not used the full force of the brake.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The assistance intervention, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with these features, up to 1 100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularisation of the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four accidents involving injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, by means of a radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he/she will help by increasing the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimise damage.
General Motors is delaying the Opel deal until January.
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragossa) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would start in the first week of April - probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega - the North American manufacturer warned that it would need more time to conclude the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, understands that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And that may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, is postponed until early 2010.
In contrast, GM says that a decision on the sale of Saab is expected in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which is also looking to buy Volvo, but the bid by Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining importance.
If he did not agree with any of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and most precious jewel, Porsche engineers started with the Boxster S and managed to trim it from just under 80 kilos, leaving the scales at just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual roof, reducing 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos gained, to mount sports poles, another 12 kilos, and with lightweight 19-inch tires, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining another six kilograms, and replaced the door handles with cloth handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the PDK dual clutch transmission, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual transmission model, mainly on roads of the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behavior can only be described as reprehensible.
The decreased weight does not prevent the car from rolling along the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary, we have not tested a model so small and light in a long time which, at the same time, guarantees so much safety in the corners, including at high speed.
He's a little athlete, able to warm up his muscles at a small speed for as long as it takes, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
With its steering, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands on the wheel indicate.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the  sport  option or thanks to a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, whether at standstill or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road surface we drove on in the Boyxster Spyder was pretty messy, but the car managed the potholes.
The electronic assistants barely made a mark of being present the whole way, while at some corners we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
In the end, it is a superlight car, one of the most entertaining to drive and is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
 Bag Girl  This is the one .
A close friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house's fashion shows, the singer displays her bad-girl face with as much restraint as her Chanel bags.
More than a Bad Girl or an It Girl, she's a Bag Girl.
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
Caja Laboral won 91-82 in its visit to the arduous Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and is thus at the top of its group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight three-point baskets, was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team made up for the significant absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas and Micov with a great deal of commitment and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets scored, largely determined the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blue and red, who took the lead from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, gave the impression that they had jumped on the Israeli pitch with hot hands.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 final in the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same note, but the Alava team chose the inside play of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by cheers and applause back at his former home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to be noticed as the best player of his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's  minus six  rating already indicated that this night was not going to be the best for the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at half-time, nothing was played, far from it, and the Avala team wanted to remind the Vitoria team that you don't win so easily on their pitch, and thanks to Elias' hand, they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini played a decisive role in the victory of the yellow over the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, who were injured but far from dead, needed to make a few clever moves to get air, and it was at this moment that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared, who, with three consecutive three-point baskets and the help of English and Ribas, returned the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the locals managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Avala team came out to play everything for everything in the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not let anyone take what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not give up and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fouls, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the final minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory eluded Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
The wounds prevent the Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost in Greece to Olympiacos and lost the lead of Euroleague Group B to Unicaja in a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the home game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), who facilitated the Greek victory.
The team from Malaga was not intimidated by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion nor by the size of the rival, undoubtedly one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The first quarter was a nightmare for the Andalusians, with an aggressive defence and three consecutive goals, two from manager Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, who stunned the home team 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the inside play of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to turn the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, an early fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams resulted in the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team started to work by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
The Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with his three-point baskets, extended the lead to 44-32 in the nineteenth minute.
It 's impossible to climb
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, showed superiority and even equalled the difference in the match played in Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, making the head of the group shake.
Lnicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last out of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left a little bit of hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was practically impossible because Olympiacos was relentless when the players were pressing and showed their superiority in centimeters in the zone.
Croatian center Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62 in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can find out what salary they deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of small ads for real estate, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The tool  How much should you be paid?  calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140 000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you have to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
"We have been using the app for a week and the search engine has detected that, as a general rule, the Spanish worker feels that he is not well paid", said Albert Ribera, product manager at Trovit, in a statement.
According to data available to Trovità from its search engines in the UK and France, Spanish workers are the least paid.
A British computer programmer receives €45,226 in gross annual earnings and a French computer programmer €31,059, while a Spanish computer programmer receives €24,000.
Similarly, a driver in England receives a gross annual salary of €34,247, in France €25,751, and in Spain €16,420.
According to Trovit, the lowest-paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11 592 euros net per year, followed by that of a salesman, with 14 725 euros, and that of a manual worker, with 15 667 euros.
The most popular jobs on the Internet over the past three months are driver, part-time and social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The ousted President will have to give up his diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that Mel knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been taking refuge since September 21, before that date.
 He is aware that he has to leave on 27 January, at the end of his mandate, and he must look for another destination .
The channel also quoted the former envoy, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government", Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, in the same week, he tried to seek asylum in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government of Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the rosy days of last spring, when asset inflation dominated the markets, uncertainty is again on the rise, which is not surprising since this is the natural state of affairs in an environment where agents make decisions about a future that is inherently uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets has been to monetize debt by directly buying assets and indirectly by providing ample liquidity at near-zero rates so that financial institutions can buy assets to mobilise.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct asset purchases are virtually complete and, without calling into question their non-compliant liquidity policy, are starting to put a little sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their one-year tender next week.
As a result, investors are doubtful about the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction in risk premia.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads are rising again, although they are still far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is once again affected.
There is again a rush towards quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the investment havens chosen by investors, leading to a widening of the differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened to further revise the rating of the Kingdom of Spain downwards.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, who were again trying to provoke a case of conscience among the global economic policy makers who had restrained the destructive effects of credit restraint on job destruction, when what they should do is decree a new Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai looks like a tribal struggle between the emirates to regain its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that finds out the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be completely irrational for ECOFIN to bail out Hungary for non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the eurozone to default on its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that the Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premia, after some excesses in high positions, this would be foreseeable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt gaps increase as European corporate debt increases, we have nothing to worry about.
If European disparities were to decline and ours to continue to increase, then there would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote: when our forecasts force most of the research services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise their 2011 forecasts upwards, with the OECD and the European Commission also coming back with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not give much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment prudence is the mother of security.
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán outlined for the press what he had said before the subcommittee, at eight o'clock.
The Iberdrola chairman said Spain needed to invest €50 billion by 2020 and €60 billion more between now and 2030 if the nuclear power plants currently in operation remained open.
If this were not the case, the investment required would not be 60 000 million but 95 000 million.
Iberdola, on the other hand, believes that for the next decade, investment should not be directed towards increasing production capacity, but towards distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 the question changes, and we will have to increase the power.
The focus is on gas-fired and coal-fired power stations, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18 000 MW more are needed, with other supportive energies.
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Law that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is demanding, did not want to attack the royal decree to encourage the consumption of domestic coal, which contradicts the policies to combat global warming.
In his view, there is a clear long-term bet in this direction, despite the "punctual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola has described them.
However, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be made as they take some time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the market for handling services for Aer Lingus at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, Ferrovial's subsidiary for ground-based airport services, will act as the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, the economic terms of which have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
Ferrovial, the Junta of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to set up the Innovation Centre for Intelligent Infrastructures.
The Alliance plans to invest 20 million euros until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the centre's tasks will be to carry out research on energy efficiency on motorways and at airports.
Acciona competes for its first motorway in Australia at Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market where it already operates as an energy company and water manager.
The project is a tunnel estimated at A$1.7 billion (approximately €1.047 billion).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast is the option for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and highway concessionaire.
The city council wants to have the system in place by the end of 2014.
Having chosen the public/private partnership (PPP) to carry out the project, under a business plan under the guidance of Ernst & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for construction and operation of the toll road.
Pending the presentation of their bids in May, the investment is expected to be A$1.7 billion (about EUR 1 047 million) and three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers, will compete in the final phase.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the market, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of the largest Australian builders, while the latter, based in Italy, is one of the leading European specialists in underground work.
Against the Acciona team, the consortium Northern Direct was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium to pass the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian company Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and the Welsh public works company Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction and privatisation, but it is very difficult to enter, if not by acquiring a local construction company.
This strategy, which was followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, besides their Asian references, is still an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has just gained a foothold in this market through its 30% shareholding in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona is focusing on a geographical area of major importance for the sector, where it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and is the head of the group of companies responsible for the construction and operation of the Adelaide desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The proposed toll road, the Northern Link, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office, is to link the Toowong Western Highway to the ring road at Kelvin Grove (map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel, the largest project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the tender will be held in the summer of 2010 and that work will start in December next year.
Despite the fact that the toll road will be opened to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction will be completed before 2016.
Design work on the tunnel began in 2005.
It will include two lanes at a time, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will contribute A$500 million to fund the project.
Brisbane is already offering jobs in Hochtief .
Australia continues to make a lot of money off Hochtief, which yesterday mentioned it had won a contract with the government worth 154 million.
The company, owned by ACS, will, through its local subsidiary in Leighton, equip the national broadband network infrastructure with optical fibre.
This will provide 400 000 people with high-speed Internet access and provide work for the German company for 18 months.
The company also sold the 27-storey King George Tower in Brisbane, which has not yet been built, and was sold for £129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC wins a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, was awarded the contract for the construction of a 2.1 km long motorway tunnel in Slovenia for EUR 64.5 million.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after it was awarded the contract for the extension of the Bosruck tunnel in Austria, for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in tunnel construction.
The construction is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore is being awarded the Renfe ad.
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Mrs Rushmore's agency, for a budget of around €3 million per year, the railway operator said.
The contract provides for two extensions of 12 months each. Ms Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies which submitted to the Renfe call for tenders, four of which were finalists, including TBWA, which has been responsible for creativity for the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of designing and producing the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Telecom for hindering competition
The French competition regulator has fined France Télécom €63 million for its anticompetitive conduct in the country's Caribbean region.
According to the Commission, the operator restricted competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, by setting tariffs and by providing loyalty programmes to consumers outside the rules.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company, has accumulated over €450 million in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it places on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considered that France Télécom had committed similar offences in the past and was therefore a repeat offender.
A shop of applications
The French company's mobile phone subsidiary followed the example of other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing non-voice revenue.
The Orange app store will initially be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for it to be introduced in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its inception.
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs, since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona earned €467.4 million, placing them third and fifth among the clubs that have earned the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only glorious, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
The competition has distributed €5 362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish teams) that have participated in the event since its inception, during the 1992-93 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona were well served in this distribution.
The white club was the third club on the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, the current holders of the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, even though they lost to Barça.
Spain, on the other hand, is only third in the world in terms of money earned by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other country (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution of
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for allocating the money used by UEFA.
This year, the organisation, chaired by Michel Platini, expects to earn €1.09 billion through the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the qualifying matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, in addition to more than 550,000 euros for each game played.
There is also a bonus for a win (800 000 euros) and a draw (400 000 for each team).Those who reach the round of eight receive three million each, the eight teams that reach the quarter-finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the winner will win $9 million, compared to the other finalist's $5.2 million.
Thus, in the case of fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7,1 million, and at most 31,2 million.
On the other hand, Barça were awarded €2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But then there are the variable payments, which are worth 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each TV market.
The Spanish market is one of the largest, with four places.
The previous year's champion pockets 40 percent of the money allocated, 30 percent for the runner-up, 20 percent for the third and 10 percent for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played in the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa is offering €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the share purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage which does not require it to launch a public takeover bid (OPA) for all the securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa is offering EUR 1,5025 per share, to be paid over 10 years and will be remunerated at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, Sos's shares closed at 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa's offer valued the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1,50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
The Jerez Group gives shareholders 15 days to indicate their interest in the sale of the shares.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to be held, the disbursement would amount to 611,7 million, whereas the capital of Sos is 254,27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of the possible bids and court battles of its former directors, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of María Luis Jordá as Director of Internal Audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food industry.
This is a newly created position which will report directly to the group president.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains mired in the legal battle over the alleged embezzlement of over 230 million S$ to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months the S.O.S. may reveal further misappropriation of funds cannot be ruled out.
As for the Salazars' credit, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) told the National Court yesterday that they had been informed of the embezzlement of 212 million without knowing its destination.
The CNMV authorises the OPA to exclude Paternina, submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday approved the exclusion offer submitted by Inversora Mer to Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorised the operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the standards in force and that it considered the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted as sufficient, following the amendments applied on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerned the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the share capital, composed of 6 142 786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He also explained that 5 592 778 million shares had been frozen and that they could not in any way be transferred before the tender was finalised, the price for which, he said, had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the rules in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, the garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have been damaged are taken to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage and the cost of repairs.
Each accident is different, and calculating the cost of parts and the time required for manpower can be a long and complex task.
Calculating by hand the cost of a repair between EUR 20 000 and EUR 30 000, including parts and labour, can take two or three hours.
However, with the help of the latest computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
The providers of claims and maintenance services and solutions are dedicated to collecting information from manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American Solera group, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
The other companies competing in the field of assessment tools and the production of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company has 63 manufacturers and importers in Spain, each of whom provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, so that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous 15 years.
When a new car comes on the market, these companies get down to work.
This is a very difficult job, because you have to catalogue each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and write down its price.
In addition, a  intelligent  graphic image of each model is created, which can be clicked on to identify the different parts of a passenger car.
If it is a mass-selling model, the work can be done in a week if the process proceeds very quickly.
If it is a car with low sales, it may take three or four months.Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
For example, among the most exclusive models, they have information on Porsches, but not on Ferraris or Lamborghinis.
For vehicles in use, the figure is over 99%.
Audatex has eight centres around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) for the documentation and development of the databases, each of which is specialised in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas, Madrid.
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million a year to build these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data items are logged, and customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables these companies to use it for different purposes and to offer a variety of products.
The most common application is for repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for calculating the fair value or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide to the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but they do it in the United States.
The products offered by Audatex give an idea of the kind of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
The company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claim assessment solution for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint shop.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is €5.75 for customers who use it only rarely, up to 10 times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of tests, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the complete identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line, just by its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the professional sector on the Internet which allows bidding on vehicles declared wrecks.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, carrying out geo-demographic analyses or for identifying common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have been taken to the garage for a breakdown or how many have suffered serious accidents for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, breakdowns or maintenance of buildings.
The GT Guide to Evaluation is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24 000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the last three years, and it had a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it started its internationalisation process by setting up an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established itself in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The Solera group's worldwide turnover (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to USD 557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In Spain, the company will receive €19.1 million, up 7.2% on last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed for $1,000 million, today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is a component of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auctions of crashed cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles involved in accidents.
The operation involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be increased to the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cashiers and professional salesmen who must be registered before they can start trading.
The platform was set up in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 transactions across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently over 1500 sellers and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
Under Spanish law, a car with its number plate removed cannot be driven again, but some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collector cars can be re-registered, even though they have been withdrawn, after complex procedures.
Four-step design for a garage
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user obtains a quote in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the spare part, creating a quote and generating it.
The ease of use is a key element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are resistant to the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1 034 vehicles, including 666 tourist vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, you need a computer and an Internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the person selects the part needed.
The user can include variables such as labour costs, increases or reductions, and then print the quote to give to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated man-hours.
