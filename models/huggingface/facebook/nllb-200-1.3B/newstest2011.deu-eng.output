The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort or the "Konditorei".
The new members of the Prague City Council from the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague City Council and the city council.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has "tapped" members of the new Council from the ČSSD a bit as they master the notorious slang that has become established in recent years, when the current coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the late era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the most well-known actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, the new councils were somewhat in the dark about what these new terms meant.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
I don't know.
"I'm rather a newcomer to Prague politics", Lukáš Kaucký, the new mayor for culture, said when asked about the "patron vocabulary".
But the mayor, Karel Březina, a veteran politician, reacted in a similar way.
Take the term "golf hole".
"That's the only expression of those you present to me here that I use occasionally".
"Otherwise I don't like slang".
From the vocabulary published by the daily Aktuálně.cz in June this year, ahead of the ODS election congress, the editorial team selected six terms, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague Magistrat.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "Prague's largest golf hole", "going to the pastry shop", "beef cuts", "betraying the capital" and "bleached".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, and the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised to take part in the discussion but did not even take the listeners.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the Civic Democrats talk to each other, I don't judge".
"What is important to me is how we understand each other in our programmes", he said.
As indicated above, Lukáš Kaucký allegedly did not recognise in the above-mentioned headline that the subject was the influential businessman and friend of the former mayor of Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" tells Kaucky nothing, and the only term he got correct on the test was "the biggest hole in Prague golf".
"This is the Blanka Tunnel", says Kaucký, adding, "but I know more about it from the newspaper".
And he joked, "I guess I'll have to take a language course".
The "golf hole" is then correctly deciphered as the Blanka tunnel not only by Matador Karel Březina but also by the councillor for environmental affairs, Lukáš Plachý.
The Socialists also know who Voldemort is, and Lukáš Plachý even knows where he is and what it means to go to the pastry shop.
"I think that means going to some Prague catering establishment", Plachy is pretty close to the solution to the puzzle, knowing that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
However, in agreement with Březina, he claims that he has acquired this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that he has this vocabulary.
The question is whether the Commission will be able to take the necessary steps to ensure that the Community's policies are properly implemented.
"I've asked my colleagues, but obviously we don't really have that".
"We call each other by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames", says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD, Petr Hulínský - nicknamed "Hulda" by his party mates.
"At school I was called Bříza (Birch), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that", says Karel Březina, who gives us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried the name and look - it works.
The Councilman Weinert is the party's friend, the "grandpa" or less the "old man", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself by his party sponsorship schemes before the elections, is called "Igráček" (a well-known Czech Lego figure) by some colleagues.
The only thing the Social Democrats allow in party parlance is nicknames.
Hulínský is said not to like being called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname for the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber-stick Rights" is supposedly related to Petr Hulínský's earning his Doctor of Juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and has published a brochure
Women who are labeled witches in Burkina Faso usually share some social characteristics.
They are more likely to be older, unemployed, for example because of ill health, single and childless.
If one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become a danger to the rest of the village.
"Men are rarely affected by this fate".
"Even young and healthy women are spared this, because they help in the work and give birth", describes a religious sister who cares for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for that reason, he published a pamphlet to stop the "witch hunt".
There's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso are illiterate", the newspaper Der Standard pointed out, pointing to the dilemma of literacy.
But accusations of witchcraft are common in other African lands.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured petroleum on her and set her on fire.
This incident was reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter was merely a coincidence.
According to their version, the oil is ignited, used for ritual anointing.
This was after the group tried to "cast out an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by the people here regardless of their education.
"Soul-eaters were once as much a danger as they are today", said a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso, quoted by the Standard.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to de-escalate the witch hunt, the Gambian president himself has been involved in a good way in the past year.
"President Yahya Jammeh started a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, as they were allegedly involved in her death and now would try to kill the president himself by black magic".
"He called on shamans from nearby Guinea, who accompanied police, soldiers and the president's bodyguards, to forcibly abduct women and men who had been arbitrarily arrested from Gambian villages and take them to the president's farm in Kanilai", Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the people were forced to drink a plant-based excrement that was hallucinogenic but also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the people arrested did not survive their stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure were the nearly one thousand prisoners released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - yet pays higher rent
An elderly man is leaving the customer center of the company RPG Byty of "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm was a briefcase with three new leases for three apartments: his own, his daughters' apartments and his son's, who is serving a prison sentence.
All three have been given a rent increase as part of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns a month, the son is to raise 4100 crowns next year for a two-room apartment with a second-class kitchen.
"And there's no running hot water in the apartment, and you have to heat it in a simple coal oven", he angrily points his finger at his son's new lease, which he has a power of attorney to sign.
"But what - I signed", he says half disagreeing and half resigning.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, when it intends to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man just waves off.
"One says this, the other says that", he makes a gloomy face.
The Ostrava region is thus becoming a large "de-regulation laboratory".
After the New Year, this deregulation will affect most rental housing in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid a market-based rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "lab" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full at nine o'clock this Tuesday morning.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a pager.
"Rent 2011", says a special touch screen light.
You type a few words, and the machine spits out a license plate.
We barely deciphered the number "157" and it's already beeping on the big display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enter the waiting room to ask for rent, but the rush in the waiting room is not apparently for the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November, the envelopes containing the new lease agreements will be floating in the mailboxes of most of the tenants of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG's portfolio in the Ostrava region.
The RPG Byty offers them in the letter an increase in rent from about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for new rentals in the customer centre has been open since 18 November.
"The campaign is running for a little over a week, so this is just the beginning", the ladies behind the counter reply after a moment's hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' apartments are a hot topic.
Before the elections, the vice-president of the Ostrava-based parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder the newspapers are full of it today.
"Twenty years I want them to have a new floor".
"They couldn't even change a single pair of toilet glasses", the man mentioned at the outset says.
So far, according to the employees, pensioners are the main ones waiting in line at the counter to make sure that they really get the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them if they sign up for the special offer in time.
The half-reduced February rent will also be granted to other tenants who sign the new lease by 15 December.
But so far, the "de-regulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded with demand.
"Of the 360 customers yesterday, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 was due here", the local telephone exchange officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites and on wall panels where necessary.
If the parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not intended to be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and fully legitimate legal process", RPG explains on its website.
"No one is going to court here", says one of the RPG Byty employees, and a man on the street in front of the customer center agrees with her at least in part.
"I have 13,000 (krona) of pension, 5,000 of which I have left for food, where should I get the money for a court case", he thinks.
That's when the employee gets insecure.
"Let's see what we can do".
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them through the media not to sign and so people are still waiting", she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic on New Year's Day 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rent is not even enough to maintain the housing fund", argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - the neglect of the housing fund, which was criticized by the bored tenants, is the main reason for the rent increase according to the homeowners.
While RPG was able to invest 4 billion in the housing sector from the rent received between 2005 and 2010, it is estimated that it will invest 5,2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered seats in the Havířov waiting room, a few red-lit information flashes in between.
'The rent increases in 2011 of 15% and below concern 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of the apartments of RPG.'
"Always this means no more than CZK 7.50 per square meter per month", reads the LCD screen.
Only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is the increase in extremely low rental prices of CZK 19,66 per square metre", argues RPG.
With 2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive rents up sharply, but will be gradual over four and eight years.
What is more, the company imposes another obligation on itself: all the income from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in the thermal insulation.
- but they should primarily benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw that the office also includes a kindergarten.
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with all the amenities that go with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys, and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design staff since last year.
The design and architecture firm Arch.Design, whose studios are home to a number of famous Brno buildings, had been planning the premises for its company's mini-kindergarten from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building.
It is a wise move, because most of its 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is keen to get the designers and architects back to work as soon as possible.
Along with the possibility of working part-time, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social programme.
It is easier for civil engineers and architects to balance their demanding job with childcare.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the staff of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The mini-kindergarten in the factory is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
This financing (grants of CZK 2.8 million) enabled the necessary facilities and equipment to be procured and qualified personnel and operations provided for for a period of two years.
After the funding has been used up (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini-kindergarten for a further 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a year, with the help of Economy Rating.
The children are cared for by qualified staff on a full-time basis - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can be attended by children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only five children are allowed to be present at a time, but several children alternate each other during the day.
The kindergarten is flexible and tailored to the needs of the parents, and the children of all employees have the same rights to use the kindergarten, regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is an individual education and care, the content of the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children here not only play, but above all they are taught excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool, and they also learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games but also with a computer at the children's disposal.
What is more, the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive work environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time, and this eliminates the stress of late pick-up from a distant kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also formed here.
Arch.Design thus joined the ranks of Czech companies which offer clear benefits in recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and which use such programmes to boost their personnel marketing.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are ripped up fish moles.
This is the Casa Batlló by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The local inhabitants nicknamed the house with its organic forms "Bone House".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tiles and mosaics, the shed-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house is filled with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remind us of nature and living creatures.
Only when you look closely do you notice that everything is governed by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the whole facade seems more plastic, more dramatic, and the special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same fluid lines and intertwined shapes dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood imitates window frames, railing, doorway ornaments, and even viewpoints and bars.
The Batlló house in the Eixample district, on the busy Passeig de Grácia shopping street, was built by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese, after the conversion of an 1877 house.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but eventually he agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
But Antoni Gaudí did not design the Casa Batlló rental house alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his sketchboard that the decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner were created and the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, many other sculptors and artists also contributed to the design of the facade.
Working together on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá in Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Soon after its completion, the house was given its organic forms by the local inhabitants, who nicknamed it "Bone House".
Others called it the "going house" because of the special window-opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted on the top of the building.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the house, with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces.
Something bizarre is already suggesting their 45-degree inclination.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building codes of the time and did not allow himself to be misled by them.
He obtained the city's building permit before construction began, but the details he gave about the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, when it was completed, the city fathers were so horrified by the result that they demanded relief.
The councillors also found that the building with its pillars even interfered with the public sidewalk.
However, no changes were made, on the contrary - just 15 days after the district requested this, Josep Batlló applied for permission to rent the two highest floors of the house - and it was granted promptly.
The owner of the house moved into the lower floors himself.
The gallery on the second floor contained a social salon, while the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment were on the third floor.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the rebuilding eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
But Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting spaces.
The social part is completely connected by the opening of the doors of the salon, and thus a larger company could chat comfortably without having to forego a certain intimacy in more intimate conversations.
Gaudí's renovation also added a rather unusual roof and two more floors, in addition to a new facade.
Gaudí's play with light and the blue and white glazed tiles that line the courtyard and the lighthouses are also impressive.
The combination of these two colors gives all floors of the house the best light.
He simply used the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors, which absorb sunlight in the opposite direction.
The Casa Batlló, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, is now open to the public.
The first floor is the most spacious and magnificent apartment open to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only in the year, on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly lucrative business, the visits were continued, and even extended to other common areas and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
The price of the visit is not a penny, however, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passes get 20 percent discount.
This is more than the entrance fees for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to befriend one of the house's inhabitants and visit him at home.
Women have different needs than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the bed - so mattress and rust make the best bed.
These must, however, be harmoniously complemented in order to meet the needs of the individual user.
Many factors are involved in the selection - the sleeper's weight, height, health, and, not least, the sex.
Equally important is the interior, where mattresses and rust are subordinated.
What's the typical example?
In a weekend home that is not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "warm up".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
- And they should be turned regularly.
If they lack ventilation channels in their core and are on a solid surface, moisture builds up, so it is possible that mold may form underneath them.
Of course, what you are used to also plays a role in the choice.
If you have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft surface are common, you will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"I've had all the hockey players who've come back from the NHL complain to me that they can't sleep here anymore".
"For their shrunken shoulders, heels, and hips, they simply need a soft coating of visco foam".
"I also recommend it to people with diabetes, who have a nervous system disorder that makes them unable to receive the 'information' from their joints and skin", explains Sylva Hadamcziková, a specialist in upholstery.
So years ago, I got many ice hockey players and other customers these mattresses with visco foam.
"Today, this is no longer a problem, as such mattresses are offered by manufacturers such as Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex and the Czech manufacturer Tropico".
And you don't have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the heat it absorbs, in other words, it sticks to the warm body.
Nowhere is it pressing, at night you don't roll around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (burn).
When choosing the mattress size, the length of the soles of the feet should still be added to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women who are about six feet tall need a bed that's about six to seven feet long.
Each sleeper should have at least 90 cm of sleeping space, i.e. 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate.
For your convenience and for any visitors.
Otherwise, the rule of thumb for the ideal bed width is: "If you lie on your back, there should be enough room for your slightly angled arms", advises Helena Prokopová, a master of upholstery and interior design who has been working on the subject of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for years and who also lectures on this subject at technical schools.
If you have a double bed, you need your own mattress and your own bed, but be careful when you shop to ensure that the mattresses are the same height.
Otherwise, there is no choice but to mount the grate at different heights, and this is not possible for every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, feather-shaped mattresses 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be on the moulding layer and the fine upholstery.
"You must not feel the feathers with your hands or when you sit down", warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
All-up beds with mattresses and bed linens like twins grown together have no place in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the linings cannot be washed, which is already the norm.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will slowly become a huge (and clogged) sieve.
For this reason, experts reject advertising that mattresses can last up to 25 years, or even a lifetime.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And so here is a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses that are 120 or 140 centimeters wide, you should not be afraid of the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, but it is recommended to use a mattress saver that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers are now usually made with a rounded cap, so that when opened, you get two halves (very important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), the manipulation of larger mattresses, especially when done alone, often resembles the uneven fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get it out!
Or at most, a bed for unwelcome guests and for one night.
Even so, they should provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are none inside) and use mattresses with a spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket springs and fine upholstery.
Polyurethane mattresses are not suitable for such a base.
For non-adjustable lattice grills with 14 to 18 spring bars (lamellae), latex or sandwich mattresses (including combinations of latex and coconut, if applicable) are suitable, always with a larger number of lattice grills, i.e. 28 or more spring bars, with a loose support in the lumbar spine and the possibility of regulating the hardness of the lattice.
Adjustable slab grills do not include mattresses with spring skeleton, as they do not respond to ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special attachment of the spring bars which allows the spring bars to be pressed in or even angled so that they allow the sleeper's shoulder to sink in a specific place.
Especially for men with broad shoulders.
Some mattress manufacturers have even begun to use soft shoulder areas for "men's" mattresses.
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point elastic wing-fenders (lattoflex) or grates with point elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension are designed.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the tension.
- But if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow for the right mattress and rust, most of the benefits are lost.
Here again, a rule of thumb is that the pillow should support the head, with its tips reaching only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
The ideal pillow is a 50 x 60 cm pillow, as the Scandinavians like it.
In the side position, the head pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the old straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their mixtures.
Even for mattresses, the new magic word is "organic".
Instead of using petroleum, natural oils - such as castor oil and soybean oil - are increasingly used to produce polyurethane foams.
I think soy is used by all the well-known manufacturers.
"The term 'organic' refers to mattresses whose core is made of materials of purely natural origin", explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
You can also use microcapsules that emit the fresh scent of forest or lavender when you sleep.
Here again, a distinction is made between man and woman.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves to allow the mattress cover to absorb heat and cool the body, women use the covers to "warm up".
Red pepper extracts stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex is comfortable when sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
But a good mattress costs 7,000 crowns and more.
Health mattresses, however, are usually subject to a lower VAT rate as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You see, saving on mattresses and rust is not so easy.
Occasionally, special offers are made by manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with visco-foam memory hidden in the frame for CZK 11,990.
The second one's free.
It was the material Tempur that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic rates.
No wonder, they were designed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Temperature becomes soft in warmth, but in cooler conditions it hardens again.
It adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body's pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burn, but also for improving sleep comfort in general.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses but also in other health products, such as special foot pads intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the Eucatherm C foams, Twinsavers or similar products.
More and more parents want human-monitoring devices to keep their kids under control
Fear for their children is growing, and more and more parents are considering monitoring their children with GPS.
The system, originally designed to search for cars, is just as good at locating people, which would be helpful in such cases as the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but it is not expected to be larger than a wristwatch any time soon.
Many people are terrified by the disappearance of Anička and are looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the price of compromising their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not a case of spying, but an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy", says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting them in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet had such a case".
"Most customers actually buy it for safety reasons", adds Pilin.
He says that the child should always know what the "box" is for and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, he simply gets rid of it.
"Even very young children are highly creative about deliberately losing things when they don't want to be controlled".
"At first, parents had high expectations of mobile phones, but they are as easy to turn off as these new surveillance devices", says Ms. Bočková.
In her opinion, it is also debatable whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper will virtually always check that the child has any electronics with him or her that could be used to locate him or her".
"Today it's the phone".
"If such surveillance devices were to be widely used, they would also seek them out, as their sale would surely be accompanied by massive advertising".
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices may be helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
'The device can be adjusted to report the position at certain intervals.'
"Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last location of the person concerned is available".
"More expensive devices even have a tiltmeter built in, which means that if you fall and remain motionless, the device will immediately send a warning indicating your position", Mr Čech claims.
He believes that similar services could also be provided by smart mobile phones with navigation, simply by plugging in special software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they're either matchbox-sized devices that look like trailers or smaller cell phones.
There's always the danger of losing them.
According to Mr Pilin of Macro Weil, this is why devices that look like normal digital watches are being tested.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to know that it is a surveillance or tracking device.
"Or he doesn't realize it until after a while, which gives the police a head start", he adds.
Whether it's going to be bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used to track the vehicle.
So the combination of the GPS tracking function (just like the navigation in the car) and the mobile phone function that reports the current position.
The army has so many matchstrokes that you could wrap the whole Czech Republic around you but only hold for two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of detonation lines, to be detonated with explosive devices.
The year before, the Defense Department had already delivered 224 kilometers of detonation lines to the army camps.
It's comforting to know that the military has been around for 225 years.
The problem is the durability of the ignition cord - two years, but four at the most.
The army bought the ignition cord from the joint-stock company STV Group, a.s. for 40 million crowns.
In his justification for purchasing this huge quantity of spark plugs, the General Staff of the MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume 60 kilometers of spark plugs annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which the Ministry of Defence DNES addressed, this statement shows that the whole army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnical training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaners.
The Council of Ministers of the EU and the Council of Ministers of the EU and the Council of Ministers of the EU and the Council of Ministers of the EU and the Council of Ministers of the EU and the Council of Ministers of the EU.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of spark plugs be half-justified.
That's the equivalent of 25,000 detonations, by the way.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts is that two meters of match is absolutely sufficient for training each new professional soldier, then the army has created a calming supply for the 225 years already mentioned by these new purchases - also in view of the increased demand for the pioneer and special units.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment and the environment.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't understand why they buy so many matchsticks from us".
But that's ultimately their decision, they'll know what they need it for".
"For us, the army is a good customer, and we want to cater to them as a dealer", says Jan Děcký, sales manager at STV Group.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of detonating wire by saying that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks of a lifetime of the ignition cord of only four years and police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
"If it is perfectly stored, the four years mentioned above are possible", admits one of them, who wishes to remain anonymous so as not to be accused of criticizing the army as a soldier.
After the end of their useful life, all ammunition must be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
These tests are not free, but they cost more.
Another argument from the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometres of fuse.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers", spokesman Pejšek tells us the position of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defense.
For comparison, the annual consumption of detonator strings by police pyrotechnicians who dispose of World War II munitions or the Soviet Brotherhood Army has for some years now barely exceeded 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only the quantities of these ammunition that they can use before the expiration of the use.
The first is the safety of the pyrotechnicians, and the second is the flexibility to purchase more modern and therefore reliable ignition cords.
The Ministry of Defence has enormous problems in liquidating tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak People's Army was preparing for its campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, the Czech Armed Forces are expecting the same problem in a few years' time when liquidating hundreds of kilometres of old spark plugs, which they have bought so "cheaply" today.
I still have the contacts I gained from the competition.
The winning placements in the 'Small Entrepreneur of the Year' competition helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell his hotel franchise.
Last year's winner of the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success is like a movie script.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
It was only abroad that he realized that there was a lack of good accommodation in Liberec at reasonable prices.
With the savings from his holiday work abroad and a bank loan, he built a dilapidated five-unit house.
Considering that he was a sixth-semester college student at the time, this was certainly a bold undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me, so I tried to do something about it", says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first apartment he had rebuilt to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested all the profits in the house, which he then converted step by step into a 54-bed bed bed.
Since then, in just seven years of business activity, he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels in Liberec with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun Design Hotel.
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other interested parties have already signed up for the Pytloun hotels franchise", says the number one entrepreneur from last year.
"A large part of this hotel licensing was achieved by winning the Entrepreneur of the Year competition", adds Mr Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater fame, even popularity in Liberec and surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, often even congratulated me afterward, and I must say that it was really good", he recalls.
I really recommend anyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win right away, any visibility is good.
He says that he still benefits from contacts and acquaintances that would not have happened otherwise.
"I have regular business relations with some of the people I met through the competition".
He also feels that the glory of success is reflected in a small way in each of his employees.
And there he is at 70.
"I notice a greater loyalty and pride in being part of something that is being recognized by the public".
I don't really see this as just personal success, but it's the result of all of us doing the right thing".
"My name has only been brought to the fore", says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a calmer year than we had in the farmhouse.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has been through the worst.
Last year's first prize in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition was won by Karel Žďárský, the owner of Farmet.
The jury then praised the efforts he made to build a business from a small tool factory in Česká Skalice that generates hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.
"I can say that this recognition has encouraged not only myself but all my employees and strengthened our confidence in the fight against the competition", says the previous year's winner.
Farmet's early history was one of doing something useful.
And then, when the state offered his father, Karel Žďárský, a small workshop to rent as compensation for the property seized by the Communists, he did not hesitate long, quit his career in the company where he was employed until then, and founded his own company with a few of his father's comrades to make plastic tubs.
Soon they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they had become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in all of Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the competition and its media coverage that it became known to the general public.
"Not only did our customers now see the Farmet brand more intensely, but our foreign partners also began to value the fact that they could work with a company that had achieved the greatest success in their country", says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, however, was not just a year of victory for Farmet.
The valuation was based on the company's financial results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool-making products.
The crisis, which at the time was affecting even less than the general public but above all businesses, was reaching its peak, with many firms being forced to stop their investment projects and to restrict the purchase of new equipment and technology.
"We could not escape this situation, of course".
"Revenue fell by 40%, we had to reduce production and even lay off people", explains Karel Žďárský
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, the situation was managed and the company was kept in the black, albeit with lower profits than before the crisis.
One was that the company was not willing to make any concessions on its investment in research and development.
"With the grant we built a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international fairs and won major prizes at domestic exhibitions", says Žďárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again, and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner much joy in the victory - but in a calmer atmosphere", Karel Žďárský said.
A poll that cleans up with nonsensical regulations
The "Absurdity of the Year" poll is now in its fourth year as part of the entrepreneurship competition.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been eliminated.
The dubious winner of the next year's "Absurdity of the Year" poll was the obligation to create documents on public authorities that are available online.
More than a third of the less than four thousand voting entrepreneurs voted.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested a paper extract from the commercial register, even though the official could have obtained it with two mouse clicks.
The polling is changing that.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the commercial register for checks on social security payers", explained Jana Buraňová, spokeswoman for ČSSZ.
The aim of the "Absurdity of the Year" poll is to examine all the rules and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with and to eliminate the nonsense.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of an entrepreneurs' competition organised by the Czech Economic Journal (HN) and enjoys growing popularity among the public.
If last year there were three thousand people taking part in the vote, this year there are four thousand.
This is not surprising, since there are still a lot of legal obligations which are designed solely to hinder business activity.
"For example, in terms of the number of income tax forms, we are ranked first in the world", says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business activity has been the proclaimed objective of all governments in recent years.
However, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved compared with the rest of the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, eight places lower than the previous year.
The absurdity of the year contest was first held in and takes place every year under the same scenario.
From April until the editorial closing of the competition at the end of September, anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
The organisers of the competition will then select seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and have the public vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year's opinion poll has already received over a hundred, or 105 more, reports of nonsensical regulations and regulations.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions requiring tolling of maintenance vehicles for motorways and expressways, or requiring undertakings with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets to submit a tender every two years.
The list of this year's "seven" is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the competition in Prague's Wenceslas Square at the beginning of November is part of a regular event attended by political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the height of the competition.
"Where the state throws a club between the legs of entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic recovery, so it is my aim to abolish at least 30 articles every year that are still unnecessarily making it difficult for entrepreneurs to do business today", said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to eliminate nonsense from the world are having an effect.
In 2007, the most disturbing thing for people was the obligation for entrepreneurs to notify the trade office at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance of their intention to travel to an exhibition or trade fair with a booth.
This obligation was abolished by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The second highest vote in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Labour Office the travel of employees for up to 30 days - was abolished by the so-called "Green Card" law.
And all good things are three:
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation that required physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the talking room.
This regulation was somewhat relaxed by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigeration requirement was dropped.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sporting projects
A new feature of the Economic News (HN) competition, now in its fifth year, is the "Responsible Company of the Year 2010" category.
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the environmental impact of their business and support socially responsible initiatives", says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafon, the mobile operator that organises and organises this competition and the Rebel of the Year competition.
For the first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodaphone Company of the Year, companies whose only long-term objective is not success have applied.
The stories of each of them are extremely inspiring and provide material for a standalone article.
Although they differ in their subject matter, their efforts have one common denominator - support and consideration.
This is the case, for example, with disabled people, with personal problems or with the health of one's own employees.
Among the 14 finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, there was the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of informal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in a variety of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper mill in Poděbrady also provides an exemplary service to its disabled workers, who make up 70 per cent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title of "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region" and came third in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, introducing fluid working hours, with an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate reduction in wages.
The jury also praised the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in its area and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We try to recycle as much as possible to minimize the impact of our business and administration on the environment", explains its managing director, Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, on the other hand, cares about the health of its employees and has therefore procured ergonomic chairs and keyboards for all their notebooks, encourages homework for its employees and uses cartering services offered by a protected home workshop for company events.
"We also support the People in Need Foundation, which provides concrete help to the local Roma community", says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company 'Praní a čištění' from the Karlsbad region, which contributes to the pension insurance of its employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We give our employees allowances for food, travel, training and holidays", says Josef Strapáč from the Bruntál construction company Czasch, which won in the Moravian-Silesian region.
The Responsible Company of the Year category was automatically awarded to all the district finalists of the Vodafon Company of the Year competition, who answered the questions in the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete questionnaire replies were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
'If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they were excluded from the 'Responsible Company of the Year' competition, but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were not disqualified for this.'
"A separate entry for this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year", explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in connection with a public tender
The anti-corruption police have been making arrests in the building of the soil fund in Pilsen in recent days.
The detectives took the local media entrepreneur and real estate agent Luboš G. in handcuffs.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
This one paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At this point I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the crime of fraudulent practices in a public competition", Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsno prosecutor's office, told the newspaper "Právo", but could not provide further details on the ongoing investigation.
Twenty-four hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was released by the police.
The extent to which he was able to manipulate public competition is speculative in view of the scant official information available.
Lubomír Černá, spokeswoman for the Land Fund, responded to Právo's question that the police had indeed made arrests at the Land Fund branch office in Pilsner during a public competition.
"It was a client and not one of our employees", she said.
According to Ms Černá, the public tender was correctly called 'Call for tenders for the transfer of land rights under the Land Act' and would be held in cases where several applicants showed interest in the land offered.
'These persons offer, in the context of the call, a higher value of their claims for restitution to be settled by the transfer than the value of the land called for.'
"According to the claims offered, the order of potential buyers is determined, after which the Land Fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer", explains the spokeswoman for the Fund.
Luboš G. apparently had information on who had signed up for the call and, being himself an entitled person, having purchased a number of refund claims, he offered to a land interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously for a big settlement.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he was carrying such a large sum of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner Land Fund.
It also played a role in the case of the former head of the Land Fund, Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for giving out land in substitute restitutions for which site decisions had already been made.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. also acquired land from the Land Fund for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the site where the construction of the motorway to the industrial area Borské pole was planned.
Later, he exchanged these with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city, far more than the value of the land.
The town hall had to give a heavy heart at that time, in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the plots.
Housing costs are rising by a few hundred a month
Households will have to expect not only higher costs for all forms of energy from January onwards, but also higher water and waste water charges and higher rents for district heating and in some places, electricity.
From January onwards, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns more from their pockets each month than they have done so far.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent or more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies, and in some places even district heating supplies are becoming more expensive.
The cost of electricity alone is several hundred crowns more per year.
The main suppliers have all lowered the prices of electricity, which is due to the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaic systems.
Gas is only becoming more expensive in moderation, but this is precisely when people need the most heat and consume the most.
So again, we can expect to earn a few hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Especially in larger cities, they're planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 crowns more per month for district heating from January, while families in Liberec will have to pay more than 1000 crowns more per year.
In contrast, the inhabitants of Prague are faced with a 9 percent increase in water and wastewater charges if the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains one of the lowest in the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and waste water charges are to rise by 7.4 per cent.
For example, huge increases in rents are to be expected in 140,000 rental units, where the so-called rent regulation will be abolished from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by 100% from January.
If you disagree with this rent increase, the company will sue you.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 dwellings, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk on Fernet and rum Beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, and occasionally a good whiskey that was stolen from the father's bar.
These are the drinks which most often require emergency treatment for drunken Czech teenagers under the age of fifteen.
Children are no exception, having to sleep through their hangovers repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the paediatric wards of hospitals.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because they take too long to get drunk".
"The trend today is clearly hard alcohol", said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief of the paediatrics department at the Central Bohemian Hospital in Hořovice.
"Whiskey, if you can get the father a bottle from the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"The advantage of vodka is that you can mix it with juice, so it doesn't smell so strong", explains the chief.
The spokeswoman for Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová, agrees with him.
"The most common is Fernet or rum".
"This is the current trend of alcohol, especially in elementary schools".
"On occasion, Slibowitz was also involved, which is taken from home", Ms Jurinová said.
According to chief physician Pelikán, drinking in hospital is no longer an exception.
Before joining the Hořovice clinic, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatric department of Motol Hospital, where ambulances delivered drowned students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times".
"Her career began at the age of 12 when she was first administered 3.5 milligrams of alcohol in her blood and in combination with ecstasy", the doctor described one particularly serious case.
"She was at some dance in Holešovice exhibition grounds".
"The interesting thing was that her mother did not feel weird that her daughter did not come home for 48 hours", the chief physician wondered.
It is the lack of interest or the unbelievable tolerance of parents in the touching of their own young that is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
Experts say that children are not really addicted in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholism is a long-term, chronic dependence on alcohol and all its associated phenomena, and this is not the case with these children".
Those who drink repeatedly are usually characterized by a negative family and social background", explains Dr. Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, by mid-November about 40 drunken children had been admitted to the local department of paediatrics and juvenile medicine.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police after outpatient treatment are not registered.
Apart from the cases where children only drink one bottle of liquor in the school bench, Mr Pelikán believes that there are three seasonal amplitudes on which one can rely 100%: Walpurgis Night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either because of grief over the bad reputation or because of the joy of the holidays".
"On the night of the Walpurgis, I also saw seven drunken children in the room at once", Dr. Pelikán emphasizes.
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is, paradoxically, better off than a child who has to struggle the next day with only an unpleasant hangover.
The headaches the next morning, caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be relieved in the hospital by a fluid-filled infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the 'glorious' experience of the evening, they wake up in a good mood with no pain anywhere".
"They're just a little confused about where they are", admits Dr. Pelikán, at least spoiling the patient's spirits by telling them the cost of treatment.
Because the ambulance ride and the night in an emergency room are worth a few tens of thousands of kroner.
"I have used this as an educational tool, telling the children directly at the visit what their drinking costs and that they may have to work all the holidays to earn the money for one such party", added Dr. Pelikán.
He also said that the health insurance companies did not use recourse procedures to recover from the parents the costs necessary to cure the drunken children.
Two L-159 training aircraft first in foreign hands - in Spain
Two L-159 light fighter jets, out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
It's the first time that machines of this type have been in the possession of a foreign army.
They have been seen abroad only at manoeuvres or airshows.
The aircraft is the L-159T1 airworthy two-seat version operated by the Czech Army.
The other three are single-seat L-159.
These are currently in storage at Aero Vodochody, which was taken over by the broker of this deal - Omnipol - last week.
When she will physically dispatch the planes from Vodochody, according to Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The L-159 single-seat fighter aircraft were separated from long-term stored aircraft without further investment or investment by the Ministry.
"The two-seater L-159T1s were replaced in their current condition and appearance", Pejšek told the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seat fighter jets, as the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four surplus L-159s to the two-seat version.
A new aircraft was delivered to the army in July, the second one is due by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to installing the fighter aircraft in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
'The contract clearly states that EADS is the customer of the L-159 aircraft and that it is intended to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the buyer how he implements the thing", Pejšek explained.
The Economist (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish Government had no interest in the L-159.
The sale of five L-159s for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner had been approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
The Ministry of Defence had not launched a tender procedure for the purchase at that time, but contacted EADS directly.
The then Ministry of Defence argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 Aero machines, of which it uses only 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
The purchase of the Casa aircraft is also likely to have a legal impact.
The European Commission has taken the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice for the reason that it should have selected the aircraft on the basis of a European-wide tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken three planes from Casa, the last one is due to land at Kbely Airport in 14 days.
Longer index than ring fingers mean lower risk of cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than their ring finger are evidently at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
It's supposed to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results suggest that the relative length of the fingers can be used as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, particularly in men over the age of 60", said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the University of Warwick's Cancer Research Institute.
The finger could thus help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed more than 1500 prostate cancer patients, but also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men were as likely to get prostate cancer as 19 percent of men with the same length of ring and index fingers.
However, for men whose index finger was longer than their ring finger, the risk dropped by 33 percent, and for men up to the age of sixty, by 87 percent.
The ratio of the lengths of the two fingers mentioned, which are already forming in the prenatal period, evidently reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone is equivalent to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is the one that accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he was only briefly aware of this study, but that he did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "fully established".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are blocked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly snow-covered, and winter attendants were on duty all night in many places.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague is "standing".
This was reported to Novinky.CZ by the dispatchers of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometre 91 a lorry crashed, at kilometre 93 two lorries collided, in this accident there are injured.
There's a couple of cars in the ditch, too.
There are also problems at 185 km of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided here too.
Drivers should either leave just behind Brno at 190 kilometres or drive over Brno and arrive at 182 kilometres at the village of Kývalka.
It's a place where traffic jams can form for miles.
There was an accident on the D11 as well, and it was just before the Prague approach.
In Prague itself, a snow cover several centimeters thick is lying, and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns are forming in the Prosek district, and Štěrboholská Street is also completely blocked.
The safest means of transportation is definitely the subway.
The tramways run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis team will meet.
There are problems at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Railways had to cancel seven high-speed train services because of snowfalls.
There are problems, for example, on the Prague-Kralupy route or on the Prague-Beroun route.
Travellers should be aware of the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport is closed from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
Most roads in South Moravia are only navigable with extreme caution.
Three side roads around Vyškov are completely impassable, snowfalls are forming in the vicinity of Brno and in the vicinity of Blansko, snowplowing is being used on some of the roads higher up.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are three roads still completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here too, snowmobiling will have to be done.
It is not yet possible to estimate when they will be operational.
In the Hodonín region, caution is called for in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which for nature conservation reasons are only allowed to be sprayed with inert spray, there is a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, reported ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimeters of fresh snow fell, most in northern Bohemia - up to 18 centimeters in some places.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell.
But in the Czech Republic, it's slowly stopping snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops have deployed a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known until now only by its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precision cannon.
Their projectiles are aimed by laser with a precision of only a few meters.
The special 25 mm caliber rounds developed for this rifle, containing high explosive, function practically like small grenades.
The missiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
That means they can be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or a trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinters from above can easily knock it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to utilize "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically does this: he aims at the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, then he gets a precise point of view, then he corrects the angle of inclination, then he just presses down.
"Let's say you measured 1,400 feet".
"When you press the button, the gun charges and fires the bullet at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu Group is moving its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move from the existing office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its headquarters from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The giant in the computer and computer maintenance industry announced on Wednesday that 400 women and men will move from their existing office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt, next July.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, it would be able to accommodate an additional 100 Fujitsu jobs, which are currently spread across the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive and the large offices in Astro Park were more responsive to the way the staff worked.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu had been a mere tenant.
The managing director Bernd Wagner said: 'With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure'.
The Commission also notes that the airport's excellent connectivity is of particular importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of a major company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The Frankfurt businessman Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "global player" had been won once again.
He said it was a "great location".
Fujitsu is a city, and the settlement is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regretted the decision by Fujitsu.
The city was informed of the intention by the management at an early stage.
"We naturally offered our help to the company", said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have been the reason for the decision.
The point is to avoid a long vacancy in such a prominent position.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will cooperate".
The house at City Hall Square, which Fujitsu used to date, and the adjacent "Small Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects in the Kurstadt ten years ago, along with the other buildings at Marienbader Square.
As a joint project between the city and a private developer, a new city entrance was built between the station and the town hall, which was criticized both for the massive construction of the areas previously used partly as parking and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems Start Amadeus and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens at the time, acquired the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu-consumer describes itself as the third-largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies with computers and servers, for example, and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has a much larger workforce in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions will move to Frankfurt-Niederrad, with Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS to be the other subsidiaries at this location.
For this, 7,000 square metres were rented in the Astro Park office building.
The 20-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped floor plan - houses the headquarters of the Central Association of the Electrical and Electronic Industry, among others.
Amazon blocks servers - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is getting more and more trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps it's political pressure after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly in England.
The whistleblower platform Wikileaks is coming under increasing fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
In the meantime, prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol wanted list, is reportedly in the UK.
"WikiLeaks has been removed from Amazon servers".
"Free speech in the land of the free", the revelation activists shared via the short-news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the Internet company Amazon had banned the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish the secret diplomatic dispatches in order to cope with the high access rates to the documents.
Wikileaks continued on Twitter, saying: "Prima - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe".
If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon has stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman investigated, CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened to boycott Amazon, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I wish Amazon would have taken this action sooner given the previous releases of classified information by WikiLeaks", the senator said.
Meanwhile, Lieberman called for the platform to be banned from being used as servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, outrageous and reckless actions jeopardize our national security and endanger lives around the globe", said a statement by the nonpartisan senator.
"No responsible company, American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material".
WikiLeaks founder Assange, wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is in Britain, the exact location of which is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as intrigues of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls for the assassination of Julian Assange".
That is why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The WikiLeaks founder will therefore continue to remain in hiding.
Hrafnsson was obviously reacting to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had called for the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations to be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said - obviously ironically - on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Meanwhile, a fight broke out between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently disclosed calls for spying on diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website", Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than his one website".
The US government is now putting the protection of its databases to the test.
The White House said the special envoy was the deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism, Russell Travers.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that were necessary after the leaks of the embassy reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which the entire government shares and protects information.
The US government also announced that it would ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be put at risk by the WikiLeaks release.
"We have made every effort to contact them", said Foreign Ministry spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect them if necessary".
The University of Eis
The Gelato University near Bologna is preparing ice-cream makers for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest attendance and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatiere, or ice-cream maker, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making.
The gelato guy takes the ice cream from the fridge with a spatula, rubs it in the waffles, and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, you can't miss the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University was set up by the ice maker in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream produced by its machines would live up to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest attendance and visitors from all over the world.
There are also special courses on chocolate ice cream and internships in the local ice cream parlor.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others simply venture on the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to do something of her own after years of a nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and a man from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only is it good taste, but it is also silky smooth and consistent.
Luciano, however, does not forget the cream of the national and southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance".
The first step in manufacturing it seems simple.
Luciano turns the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that uses an electronic program to heat everything to 85 degrees and then instantly cool it to four degrees.
Then he turns the machine on a tap, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk.
The lecturer is immediately bombarded with questions: Can ice cream be made with only natural ingredients without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimentation run free?
Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of the times.
Those who say that ice cream is "all natural" may have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar bean meal.
Of course, you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, but you have to sell it within a day or it will pack up and the customer will bite into the ice cream.
Certain variations in the ground mass are permitted.
The flavors are getting more exciting.
For the taste of the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit section or the candy store.
And there's powder and paste.
"The suppliers will all try to spin you dozens of flavored additives".
"But you should just experiment".
Or the fruit shorbet with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or the ice cream made from the white mass of the ground, which turns yellow cream with eggs and cocoa powder into the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now the students can use the ice machines.
Luciano has them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha, and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also carried out on fruit varieties.
More flavorings, more fruit puree - that's not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water, and a little less stabilizer.
Luciano says that a balanced mix will bring out the flavor of a gelato.
Freezing is a calculation task: if peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano develops a device to measure the sugar content of fruit varieties (winemakers use it to measure the oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, tables make it easier to do the math.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as it once did.
It's not just the machine that helps with the automatic production of the base.
There is also a device that simultaneously creams the finished ice mix and cools it to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation, small failures are not absent.
Gustavo, a Brazilian, is splashing fruit puree on himself and his classmates from top to bottom when the oversized stick mixer gets out of hand.
"In any class", says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens".
Inspectors in the twilight
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is undermined by the genetically modified plant industry.
This is the accusation now made by the group of experts Testbiotech, which considers itself an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well", said Christoph Then, head of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the EFSA Group of Experts on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi lobbying association for years.
It's paid for by companies like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment by the European Parliament.
The EFSA rules are in some respects similar to Ilsi's position papers and thus bear the signature of the industry, which is supposed to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is the second time that Testbiotech has complained about a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking EFSA manager recently switched sides to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any conditions or deadlines.
The German Broadcasting Corporation (MDR) also recently revealed personal links between EU regulators and the industrial lobby, which made the Federal Environment Agency and EU parliamentarians deaf.
Efsa, however, cannot see any conflict of interest.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to cover the costs of the new technology.
The experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contacts with industry.
You'd have to reveal them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the USA.
It describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticize the fact that GM crops are currently allowed without any animal feeding tests and that the response of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what GM maize is doing in the field", says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole plant, which does not yield reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you going to find them?" Then asks, accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck is of the same opinion.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this field, as in the United States and in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers left who are not involved in corporations.
Critical studies for companies would not normally be published.
"Industry controls the research on safety", Hilbeck claims.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell has also got some, about 400 kilos in total.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of Stuttgart station, the Tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It's snowing.
The story is well known: in September, the dredgers had moved in and started to break down a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the multi-billion-dollar demolition of the station.
When construction was halted, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken up into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer mussel lime, a soft coarse stone, installed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfeldern, 43 years old.
He secured some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics".
"They must not disappear".
He exclaims, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy".
When he saw you, you smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell is too.
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is a dealer in old stones.
He bought all the people who fell in the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground to rubble or disappeared in the garbage dump", he says in his office, a wooden shed that was once a guardhouse.
He says he was insulted and threatened when it was reported in the newspapers in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything about the demolition.
And if that happens, it would be the wisest thing to do if the stones were to be used again.
About 200 S-21s then took one of the 80 kg squares, with a price of 6.50 to 14 euros per piece.
As a souvenir, but some also in the hope of returning it when it is rebuilt.
He bought 500 tons of Rongen, 25 large truckloads.
About half of it's still in the woods, the rest is long sold.
Gardeners, landscapers, home builders. They're all the same.
They came from everywhere and carried away what the trunk and the trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stumbling blocks have long since been transformed into "walls" or confines of herb beds.
"This stone is nothing special", says Rongen.
"Don't be the political component".
He gets in his SUV, takes a tour of his 20-acre empire.
He studied law and dropped out, then biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And lovers of stones.
He stores 40,000 tons of rock.
He's been carting his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest antique dealer in the Republic.
He's on the brakes.
There are artificially carved sandstones in the snow.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Mary Bridge", he says.
Elvish sandstone, yellow, warm, it is delightful.
"My favourite stone".
It's going up through the woods.
He points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And on and on.
"Beautiful travertine". What is that?
The squares once belonged to the stands of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
All over the snow, stones and stories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the Saint Blasien Cathedral, tuff from the Heilbron Hospital.
What work, what toil, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were carved by hand and moved by simple bottle-dragging and ox-cart, he is filled with awe.
"It would be a scandal to shred something like that".
He hasn't become rich, not at all.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, and they have also settled up in the woods, including a stonecutter, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblowing artist, and a gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying", says the recycler.
He's going to Cologne soon.
There are rocks to be saved, too.
Competition for high potential
There's a lot of buffet.
16 students are in a hurry to get salmon sandwiches, tomato soup, and candy.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are to talk to VW developers about the car of the future - and, in the process, get to know Volkswagen.
In the competition for the best minds, many companies are now entering the competition and, like VW, are relying on cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the classrooms before they enter the labour market and are solicited by others.
And because universities don't publish rankings of their students' achievements, they try to spot and capture the exceptional talent in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company is looking for talent.
A young lady from the human resources department is handing out pens, rubber bears and VW-logo briefcases.
She tells the hopeful young talent about internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the company.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig is supervising the project with VW.
He sees the benefits on both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience".
"VW can get to know students at the same time, take a closer look at interesting candidates and decide who would be eligible to work for the company".
Such cooperation, says Selle, is not uncommon.
It's new that students are being bullied so aggressively.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project", says Selle.
The battle for the fresh graduates is going to get even tougher.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to select their employees from a large pool of applicants.
They must boast of their skills and especially of their highly skilled workforce.
The graduates from the engineering disciplines in particular are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineering jobs were unfilled in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will grow even larger, according to VDI forecasts.
For the accounting and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta is on the hunt for talent.
It organises elaborate recruitment events such as the KPMG Race, a modern form of scavenger hunt in which participants must find their way by using GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students across the United States next year.
In addition, participants can visit KPMG branches and get to know the company.
The winner is decided in two rounds of selection.
Only the cream of the crop of applicants flies to the United States.
As you go around the universities, you're gonna get bigger and bigger.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race".
"We were not satisfied with a simple sail".
Talent scout Dykta seems to be getting the bill.
"We are still in contact with all the participants in a similar campaign last year".
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply to work with us soon", he says.
In addition to the direct buzz on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises in particular are also classically at trade fairs.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade fairs".
"It was on Intersolar", reports Sitha Stübe, human resources manager at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the younger generation.
The company's website currently lists 35 vacancies.
"It is very difficult to fill vacant positions at the moment".
"It takes a lot of time and money", she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors are giving you hints that you can do an internship or write your thesis".
Expensive promotions are not in the sun specialist's favor.
The company is trying to promote itself by other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large company often cannot offer this", says Stabe, head of human resources.
Money is no longer the main factor in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld was ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their working environment and looks at the general conditions for employees.
Staff manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also bring positive results for jobseekers.
"I think that applicants are looking especially for external reviews of a potential employer", she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as employers with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, mostly internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees", he says.
In industry jargon, this is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within one's own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors".
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, they will be able to advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances on their own.
"It's like playing with gangs", says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
Off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
The Washington administration has issued a similar ban - effectively reversing its earlier plans.
New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The strict ban, which is to last at least five years, was triggered by the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April.
Before the accident, which killed 11 workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents of the measure want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign oil supplies.
The Commission has not yet decided who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf.
The criticism is directed at British energy company BP, which is facing billions in debt.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion.
The Commission has also been asked to submit proposals for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tighter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent control authority, which had fallen into disrepute following numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing a fundamental reform.
In parallel, Obama announced that he would close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the amount of production in the Gulf would be significantly less than before if regulation were tightened.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry", according to a recent industry survey by consultancy BDO - even before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also bemoans the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation".
Investment in new development projects would be postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a gas station: billions of litres of crude oil spilled have destroyed the nature in the Ogoniland of Nigeria.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil-cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't be discouraged", the environmental activist reassures the journalists: "You'll get enough oil mud in front of the lens today".
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been watching a boy floating up to his chest in the water with the gills surrounding him, and the rainbow-colored glow of the water is almost beautiful.
You can't see brown oil waves floating under the surface.
Esther Badom, who lives on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River, says that she used to collect shrimp in buckets.
By now, the slow-flowing waters were dead.
Five years ago, a leaked pipeline spilled vast quantities of crude oil into the vast wetlands.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach fish-rich waters. Ogoniland, in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the erosion becomes apparent as you drive through the mangrove swamps that are crossed by rivers.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat makes brown broth, and those who dip their hands in the water, pull out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangroves are sticking out like black licorice stalks, sadly leaving the stalks hanging from the palm trees that occasionally fall.
The search for the usual swarms of birds in wetlands is futile: As soon as the outskirts are silent, a ghostly calm spreads into the former paradise that smells like a gas station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare", says Celestine Akpobari gloomyly: "We live in constant danger to health".
The war is a fitting metaphor.
The Ogoni settlement is a battlefield that has been fought over for decades: here, more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers invaded, here, in the 1980s, the first resistance was organized with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was later executed, here, in 1993, the Shell Group had to stop production because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
The company is still denied the right to return to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with over 5000 wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the situation is too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred meters steel frames rise like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the boreholes much too tenderly.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the core.
Time and again, Akpobari says, such a drill head breaks apart, and then a steady stream of crude oil flows into the water.
More than two billion liters, experts estimate, have flowed into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years, year after year, the amount of oil that flowed into the sea off Alaska 21 years ago in the Exxon Valdez supertanker crash - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
The question of who is to blame for the continuing eco-GAU is a matter of debate.
While Shell blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main culprits.
Shell is applying much lower safety standards in Nigeria than elsewhere in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner told the company in 2008, but the rate of faulty wiring is "many times higher than elsewhere".
In what from a distance looks like an abandoned, oil-soaked workshop in the open air, figures emerge from the mangroves, splintered and oil-soaked to the neck.
One of the many barrels, partly connected by pipes and partly scattered on the premises, is on fire: an illegal small-scale refinery.
The barrel heats the crude over a fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group's chief.
First, gasoline enters the receptacle through the pipes, then kerosene drips out at the end of the pipe, and finally diesel.
Michael and four other workers produce up to four 300-liter barrels of diesel a day. "That brings us $34,000", he says, "about $22".
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-rich state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The price of diesel, which is ridiculously low at just under 40 cents a litre, is still under-priced by the illegal cooks, who get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" that tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland, which experts say is losing at least 16 million litres of crude oil a day across the Niger Delta.
Only a tiny fraction of the raw materials that are provisionally stored are illegally processed: the lion's share is loaded onto tankers by organized criminal networks, which are said to include politicians and high-ranking military officials, and then smuggled onto the world market.
The debate over whether the environmental disaster is due to the population's excesses or the lax production methods is considered purely academic by the activist Akpobari.
"If the oil companies had not been perceived as invaders and had not so thoroughly destroyed the livelihood of fishermen, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries".
The Ogoni's relationship with Shell, in particular, has now been so bad that it would be a matter of a withdrawal of the group: "Maybe other nationalities, like the Chinese, are better".
That's where Michael gets nervous.
"It's time for you to go", says the muscular oilman.
"The soldiers are coming any minute".
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special forces, they may not be arrested, but they may be given a painful bribe.
The soldiers, who are mainly from the north of the country, want to profit from the raw material, as do all Nigerians.
"This damn thing has turned our country upside down in every way", says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major safety problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible engineering error in an emergency machine that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas is now suing the engine manufacturer.
Passengers on the Qantas Airbus that crashed in early November appeared to be much luckier than they had been before: The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 aircraft during its investigation - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in an oil hose connection, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, said a statement from the ATSB published on Thursday.
This could have led to "catastrophic engine failure".
The concern concerns engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which made an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed a complaint in the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows it to pursue further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would seek damages for the incident in early November.
The engine fire had torn parts and damaged the bearings.
Rolls-Royce has ruled an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the accident, up to 40 engines are now in need of replacement worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would conduct further safety tests on the superjumboes equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety problem was considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas plane, the airline had kept its A380 fleet grounded for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded about three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced the engine on an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Snowfall across the country causes traffic chaos
Germany in all white: Almost all of the country snowed overnight.
Many roads are in chaos, trains and flights are disrupted.
At least three people died in car accidents.
Winter freezes in Germany: With freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is snowing on Thursday night - causing traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, there are partially 15 centimeters of snow.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
The winter service was on the A7 near Flensburg, but it was not able to cope with the constantly new snow.
In addition, severe storms swept the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Affairs and Hydrography (BSH) is expecting storm surges with water levels 1.2 metres above normal levels on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein from this morning.
In Saxony, snowfalls on motorways and federal roads caused considerable problems.
According to the Meteorological Center, the alert level in Saxon Switzerland was therefore violet - the highest level ever.
Some of the snow fell as much as 30 centimeters [30 cm] fresh, and the winds were strong and fresh, causing the area to swell.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there overnight.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the roads.
On the A2, snow and wind led to traffic jams and congestion.
In Thuringia, the snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or damaged overhead lines and crossings are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE to Munich had to stop its journey.
The 165 passengers were provided with wool blankets, food and drink on board by firefighters and rescuers.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
At major German airports, snow winds cause numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, there have already been some cancellations.
In Frankfurt am Main, a Fraport spokeswoman said 40 flights had already been cancelled.
The winter shift was on permanent duty.
Although there were few stranded passengers at the airport, there were still just under 400 field beds available for them.
On many roads there were accidents on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg, where a truck was caught at a railway crossing because it was stuck on snow-covered roads.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the early hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crashing her car on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
The good news is that the snow will still be loose and powdery, and it will swirl in light weather.
But the wind will subside.
Only the Baltic Sea is beset by swift and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - up to minus 15 degrees Celsius in some areas.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to get rid of its iconic landmark: According to a newspaper report, the bank is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The real estate could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters look beautiful: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernised; in the meantime, bankers have been allowed back to their old jobs.
But now the financial group is apparently trying to recoup the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, according to a spokesman for the Financial Times.
The reasons for the planned sale were not given by the spokesman.
"We always look at whether it makes more sense to own or sell property and then rent it back", he said.
The largest credit institution in Germany will thus hand over its headquarters in a short time.
The Bank had only taken over the Twin Towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investors of an in-house fund and subsequently carried out extensive renovations.
The energy conversion cost around 200 million euros, according to the figures.
I think a sale would bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed "Greentowers", to be around 500 million euros, according to the newspaper.
Whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn for dead buddies
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the miners who were found dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not been recovered because the safety situation in the accident shaft remains precarious.
Just under two weeks ago, a massive explosion occurred at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners, aged between 17 and 62, were buried.
A probe had been lowered into the disaster shaft, but had not detected any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue workers were unable to descend for safety reasons.
After the second powerful detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the fellow.
The bodies have not been recovered.
Now relatives and friends held a memorial service for the dead.
Ten thousand people had gathered in the sunshine of Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the miners who were killed, 29 tables were set up with helmets, lamps, and the names of their comrades.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place.
In front of the country's government buildings, flags were waving at half mast.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would "come out of the depths of the earth" and return to the surface, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the memorial.
"But they never came home".
He can't come to terms with his son's death until he sees his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was dumped in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the families of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the memorial service.
The first explosion on November 19 also involved miners of British and South African origin.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases are removed, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to cool down, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warrior!
Does Splatter fit in with the art house?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is re-telling the story of the battlefield in his epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents in a series with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and tears his enemies' intestines out of the living body when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, tells the whole film without a word, and the other characters can be dragged to one or two sentences at most, or a few excruciating death cries.
Otherwise, silence is maintained and the scary, beautiful highlands of Scotland are the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera drives.
It's nice when a film has multiple audiences, but it's a shame when they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, since his wild and stylish Pusher drug dealer trilogy, is considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutality to the arthouse.
Most art-cinema fans would be deterred by the brain mass and bowel movements.
The action fans will die of boredom at the latest when, for reasons that are freely interpretable, Einauge sets sail for Jerusalem with a squad of violent Christian missionaries and is trapped in the fog and fog for an eternity before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues their silence there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a theatrical release in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is especially unfortunate because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade there is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that has deserved some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a strict plot, it's all about atmosphere, a fever dream turned into a film.
And there is no escape for the onlooker.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly strangles him with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the unfathomable hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who stands by One Eye's side, keeps himself as innocent as anything, all the rest are driven by rage.
Mostly the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who, to enemies and temporary allies, eventually becomes a warrior from hell, possibly an emissary of the devil himself.
It means corruption, but perhaps only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, to excite and to marvel at.
It's an experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country, however, refuses to comment on this - nor does it allow checks.
At around midnight on September 5th to 6th, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 20 miles [30 km] away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents regarding the reactor that Syria allegedly built with North Korean help in the quad, hidden in a valley that is cut off from the power.
According to a CIA briefing in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - which could be used to build nuclear weapons.
For other purposes, however, the technology of the 1950s is hardly suitable.
The CIA was presenting a video presentation with blurry satellite imagery.
They used computer animation to show where the components of the reactor were before the destruction, which was a scaled-down replica of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
She also presented photographs showing the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was said to be close to being commissioned, but not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little is known about it as it was then, and the mysteries have become more complex.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that while the CIA was fairly certain prior to the attack that Syria was building a reactor at el-Kibar, it saw little evidence of "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some European intelligence officials are even more cautious and refer to it as an "alleged reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation to be "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, and so does the IAEA.
Asked how confident he was that he had a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat in the summer replied only lamisly that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
The Syrians quickly cleared the debris of the supposedly "unused military building" and carefully planned the site.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial suppliers from the immediate aftermath of the attack, via a Member State, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
The IAEA is therefore unable to independently verify their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium was from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
But the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as has the satellite imagery.
It also denies the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed-out building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this", the Prime Minister at the time of the attack, Ehud Olmert, recently reiterated the official position.
The investigation of the case has been dragging on since June 2008 and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the agency", admits a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, there is a serious violation of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty in the space over which the IAEA is guarding.
The IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are supposed to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and that exist other than this one - as the key to progress in the investigation.
The inspectors have not disclosed what the plants are, what their function is or what makes them suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these sites and has identified a building complex at Masyaf on satellite imagery, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or near a military base - the very reason why Syria denies the IAEA access to the three sites.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the US to scout military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had been alerted to the facilities by a tip from the U.S. intelligence community.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite imagery, that material was transported back and forth between the three sites and the Euphrates quadrant.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
But there is "no evidence of any sensitive activity", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing, processes needed to build nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by unenriched uranium.
But where the uranium was supposed to come from and where the plutonium for the bomb was later to be separated from it, there are at least plausible conjectures on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could hold valuable traces was stored at the three locations.
It's like hundreds of truckloads have disappeared from the ground, and nobody wants to know where the debris is.
The Salzmine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria examined in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste dump, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from orbit show that Syria was conducting groundwork and removing large containers at the three suspected sites after the IAEA requested access.
That may be a coincidence, but it has done little to clear the suspicion.
It is also said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - the effort alone shows how much interest the inspectors have.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
The Commission has also been involved in the implementation of the European Union's nuclear programme, which is the first step towards the achievement of the objectives of the European Union.
IAEA Director Yukiya Amano, who should have proposed these inspections, has already spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk involved in this: firstly, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and several of the 35 countries represented there are far from ready for escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat might think, "What if they don't find anything at all?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her yet-to-be-named directorial debut this summer, there's been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
Much more is unknown - but enough for concern.
The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's organizations immediately protested, prompting some of the filming scheduled in Sarajevo to be moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims Organization wrote to Jolie about the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself an ambassador for the UN Refugee Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, which they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, according to Hasecic.
There were no rape camp romances, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims tells her enough about the script.
Her organisation has recommended that the UN Refugee Agency dismiss Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which read her script, has been giving permission to shoot for Sarajevo after a while - it's not entirely clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author herself says that she has no political intentions with her film, that she has worked hard in the Yugoslav conflict, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film is circulating on the Internet, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds a lot different than the "rape victim falls in love with torture slave" version.
That Jolie's movie actually starts before the war, that much is certain.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, was "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now all you can do is get the Hollywood hackers to go quiet by illegally posting the script, like so many others have done before.
Nothing like getting out of here
Tonight is the night the Irish are back on their feet.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans are cheering for joy at the loud music, they're stomping with their feet.
The Bailey Pub in South Cork is shaking as players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance into beer cups - and hit.
It's called "beer pong", and the winner gets a $500 prize plus a plane ticket to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this shy drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, that doesn't really fit.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to have fun, distracting himself from the perplexing question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to gamble in Las Vegas, but to interview in New Zealand in January.
"I have a feeling of a little bit of a tingling", he says.
"It's so far from home and I don't have a job there yet".
After all, his girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a good time, she got her dream job as an event manager, maybe a good sign", says the young man, smiling.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their fortune abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys leave, and it's like the Tanners, it's like a lot of families on the island.
Experts at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Dublin predict that 100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future.
They even expect 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For a small country of only 4.5 million people, it's a terrible loss.
If the forecasts are correct, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of prosperity that brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is now brewing again.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettling for young, well-educated Irish people, who have been on the rise so far.
Job losses and social degradation seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was abundant.
But now three out of ten women and men under 30 are out of work.
The Irish Times frequently quotes readers of young emigrants who complain: "Everything is going to hell in Ireland".
"There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation".
"The last one turns off the light".
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a bleak future ahead because the government is just blindfolding and failing to offer young people a future.
"They're lowering the minimum wage, but they don't have a strategy for how to create new jobs", says the 20-year-old.
She watches her fellow students swing from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is that she will have to emigrate herself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing".
And men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to take a positive approach to this.
McLarnon organises the WorkingAbroadExpo, a trade fair which offers a full service on working abroad.
"Working abroad is a great opportunity for newcomers to take their first steps on the career ladder", says the manager.
On his website, he shows photographs of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a job, it is freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known what it feels like to build something else for six months.
With no work left in Ireland, the 29-year-old engineer is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
They're building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, we'll go to Hannover or Berlin for the next project.
O'Donovan has rarely been to his hometown since he's been working overtime to pay off the mortgage on his house.
"The situation is a bit crazy", he says as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm almost never again".
He's laughing a little embarrassed and walking through cool rooms.
The small house is in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, with large, expensive cars parked in the driveways.
O'Donovan and a sister bought the house for $380,000 four years ago - 100% credit.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions", he says.
Is he afraid that the loan might go bad?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea, and says, "I have no children to feed, and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over".
The civil engineer does not like the lamentation he often hears these days.
"No one has to go hungry - our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in earlier times here on the island", he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it makes us feel like Irish".
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life in Ireland went on, simple as that".
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Leave the future open and just see how life is elsewhere.
He's already done a few years in London, so why shouldn't New Zealand be good for him and his girlfriend?
But there is one more thing that has been troubling him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's worried it might turn into a goodbye party.
"Just don't get too emotional", he says, taking a big sip of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds scary".
"Let's call it a party, "a little relaxed, "with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games".
The democratic routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is growing, as is the support for private enterprise.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These results are the result of the Latinobarómetro survey, which was carried out in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in the region.
Two facts stand out in particular in this year's survey of September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has grown strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing at about 6% a year since 2002, the number of pro-democracy voters has risen from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Similar trends are evident in Mexico, where the economy has been recovering since last year's sharp slump.
However, only half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
Some 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice in their country, the same as last year but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% trust their country's congress and 45% their government, both figures corresponding to last year's figures but showing a marked increase compared with 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts to promote democracy.
The fact that this trend continued during the global economic crisis may be due to the fact that Latin American countries experienced only a brief recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor have been catered for by a stronger social network.
(According to reports this week from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly in 2009 and has fallen again this year by 32 percent.)
However, there are considerable differences in sentiment from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progressive mindset.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more pronounced and violent crime increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the survey began, many Latin American respondents see crime in their country as a bigger problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Some 31% say that either they or a family member was a victim of a crime in the last year, but the figures have fallen from 38% last year to the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the increased support for the private and market economies: around 71% of respondents across the region indicated that the private sector is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% said that only the market economy could bring progress to their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela maintained this view (and 80% are in favour of a private sector), even though their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies.
Brazil has the highest weight in the region according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
In contrast, respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries see the United States as the most influential country, with Venezuela taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A vote of no confidence
No one expected the November 28th elections in Haiti to be perfect.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of the voters who rushed to the aid of the battered country.
Overcrowded polling booths, multiple votes, ballots in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only some of the problems.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, many of whom were left homeless by the January earthquake, wandered about in search of a choice.
Some eventually gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed top leaders, demanded the annulment of the election results on the grounds of alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "pretty good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral commission, which is supposedly committed to the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected draw is scheduled for January.
There's still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rapper Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity suit.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no support among the electorate, is declared the winner of the by-election by the polling stations, this could lead to problems.
The cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims still live in tents have raised fears of low turnout.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organization.
Shortly before the election, some 250,000 identification cards needed for voting had not yet been distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized government an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitian people themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following your husband's sudden death, Argentina's President Cristina Fernández experienced a wave of sympathy that propelled her popularity rate up 20 points to over 50 percent, the highest since her election in 2007.
But whether she will win re-election next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is as willing to compromise as her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who continued to direct economic policy after his wife was elected, often drew up budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the couple to spend the extra income at their discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further disagreements.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the governing Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (one lawmaker punching another in the face and others accusing the government of bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it", the President said.
The 2010 budget now extends to the next year, giving the President even more opportunity to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is in hot water: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands from the trade unions - push the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was rocked by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction as his main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then embellished the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate course?
It has called for talks between the private sector and the trade union leaders.
And according to official statements, wage increases next year will be capped at 18%.
The high world market prices for Argentine agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
However, inflation undermined the growth boost by a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps Cristina Fernández wants to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's earlier debt rescheduling in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for a deal with the Paris Club's backers, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused to be audited by the IMF, as is the custom elsewhere.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like the first step in the process of purifying the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after her term ends without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely had enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy that has been poured out toward them will be over.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to quietly overturn many of her husband's political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly moving closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of the electorate, went to the polls to elect the mayor and city councillors in the five city districts, which is seen as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland through the establishment of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement.
Ma passed the exam, but only by a narrow margin.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) is three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, received almost 50% of the vote, while the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have been a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even entered the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual Taiwanese events, such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-waving mass rallies, and scantily clad dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, Lien was wounded and killed by a bystander.
Weird weirdo is not sure if the shooter was trying to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack affected the election and cast the DPP in a bad light, which gave the KMT more votes.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
It is noteworthy that relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time, the DPP also avoided stirring up anti-Chinese sentiments too much.
It was a response to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The Government in Beijing will continue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community through economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
I am sure that the Commission will be able to make a number of proposals.
It is better to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has since reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was severely weakened when former party leader Chen Shui-bian was jailed for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was a strong advocate of absolute independence.
But under Tais's rule, a new generation of moderate politicians has emerged and the DPP is fighting for the voices of the working class and the youth.
Tsai was a popular candidate for the DPP presidency, as was Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything it can to show that it too is capable of building close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning to set up an idea-making centre as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this requires open discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offers a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas's early approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he declared that the DPP candidates had better insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even urged the pragmatist Su to resign from the presidential race.
Even without Chen's intervention, the DPP is having a hard time choosing its possible candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas's ratings are poor, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will reshape his cabinet and local institutions.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only in favour of a limited rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to prominent columnist Antonio Chiang, "there is no turning back".
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category of Newcomer of the Year
If you're performing at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself invited Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, and now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been surprisingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the category of Newcomer of the Year.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated star on the jazz scene since her 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination seems a bit unusual, but it meets the Grammy rules that an artist must have released at most three albums before the release of the album that made him known to the general public.
Her 2010 ambitious album, Chamber Music Society, is certainly a step forward, and with her vibrating voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, you can easily compare Spalding to 2003's Norah Jones, whose 2003 great success as a jazz performer in this category comes closest to Spalding's nomination.
The album "Historicity" by Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category of instrumental albums and was a huge success.
Iyers' competitors include "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans fan favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the Contemporary Jazz category, which otherwise tends to feature albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the big band category, and thus competed against the Billy Childs ensemble with its chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octave, whose Life album "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classical nominees for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The list is headed by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and five-voice orchestra, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic three-voice orchestral work.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
The classical nominees are divided into 13 categories, from orchestral, opera, choral to solo recordings.
In the classical producers category, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the classical albums nominated are Bruckner's Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hass's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" from the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales were nominated.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for a Grammy for his Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on January 4 at Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concert" was nominated in the category of Instrumental Solo with Orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer claimed to have written the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolinist Avi Avital, who was performing the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms", Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral category for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The instrumental soloists were the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Temecula mosque wins approval from planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was unanimously approved by the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated, public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a statement from the commission Wednesday evening, the new religious center is in compliance with local regulations and will be an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Baha'is, and many others", Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"As an American, I'm proud of that".
"It shows that justice is done".
"There are few opponents", he added.
"They're just very loud".
"There are wonderful people in this valley".
The session began at 6 p.m. and discussions for and against the center's construction lasted almost until midnight, with votes on both sides fairly evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore", was one comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty lies dead in the sand".
"America is finished".
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a manufacturer of water filters.
The new mosque, which will be 2,300 m2 in size, is designed in the Mediterranean style and will have two minarets, with a height of 13 m.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot of land on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still file a complaint with the city council against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible without the elements previously thought to be essential for life.
"This organism has two possibilities".
"It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow".
"This makes it very special, even though it's almost a kind of 'alien' life form", said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday.
Up to now, six basic elements have been considered essential for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
But scientists found that the bacteria in Mono Lake, California, continues to grow even when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible", said Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the report at Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study is looking at microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report might be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can use other elements to initiate biochemical processes and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely necessary for life are not necessarily fixed", explains Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another", added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she speculated that microbes exposed to both could possibly replace one element with another.
"The toxicity of arsenic is primarily due to its chemical similarity to phosphorus".
"It makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another".
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently from phosphorus, and it gets into our biochemical system, where it lubricates almost everything", explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to increasing levels of arsenic, and it adapted and grew.
The microbe grows better in phosphorus, but the fact that it can survive in arsenic also suggests that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more abundant.
According to Jamie S. Foster, an associate professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but there has been no working example so far.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, which is why science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This suggests that life may have evolved differently from the early Earth", says Forster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The rest of the stolen show dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four show dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel have been found, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Thursday.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared Tuesday when unknown persons stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van where the animals were staying outside a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon, and the last two Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is the dogs are fine", Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape".
"They have been returned to their rightful owners".
Whitmore did not give any specific information about the location of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing".
"We don't want to say anything more", Whitmore explains.
"We're following some leads".
The owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They took their two dogs to a county shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - a 3-year-old mare named Trace and a 10-month-old female dog named Didi - were unharmed, according to authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, which Rickard and Peek were planning to present this week at the competition on behalf of their Japanese owners, were missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to compete.
As Peek reported to The Times on Wednesday, the other dogs were scheduled to compete in other competitions in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is one stop on the couple's nearly month-long tour of dog show to dog show.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside their bedroom window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The thick-billed Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so the dogs could get some fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised a finder's reward to anyone who could give us a clue to the Corgis, and the animals were implanted with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether a finder's fee would be paid.
The lion's roar again after court clearance for MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM has finally been given the green light to start anew.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially approved the "prepared" creditors' plan to pay off $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to launch new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday's statement, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so there is nothing to stop the re-launch of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, who will lead the slightly lean studio as chief executive.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually take effect until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
Right now, a consortium of investment banks, which is raising $75 million of its own money, is running the company, and the funding is due in mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with an order to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management company struggling with interest payments of $300 million per year, to help solve its financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to resolve MGM's financial worries and pay off the studio's more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted few bidders, and none were willing to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started over again when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which, after months of debate and internal disputes, was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October.
If MGM officially goes bankrupt in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month to run the company, receives a $4 million "success bonus".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year and has a yearly schedule of seven or eight films scheduled to hit theaters in early 2012.
They're also planning two more films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio will need a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial stake in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies have not yielded any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite gift is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video game console, both of which can make a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price of a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can spare your gift budget.
Recently, in my search for three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy stores -- a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us, and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's Law had come into force, and this year, the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time a little less expensive than last year.
And although fewer new toys are coming out with their own websites, the most well-known of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer a wider range.
Button-cell toys are coming on the market, and many of them include rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices quoted are from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children 3 and older) are plush figures the size of guinea pigs that sing a note when pressed against their belly.
One press is a note, several presses can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start to push, you can't stop.
For a combination of messenger and dance, the dance star Mickey (Fisher price $60, for children 2 and up) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interactions like "Simon Says", and thanks to its novel wheel-locked hinge legs, it is able to master the Moon-Walk.
The children who tested the device used Mickey as a dance instructor, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you probably remember Alphie, one of the first computer-generated educational toys.
Now it's back there (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children 3 and up), with a whole bunch of questionnaires that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a car-correction expert as a teacher.
If you're not comfortable trusting your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard, but the games included are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children ages 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major overhaul of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90 for children aged 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and e-books, and the SD card drive also allows family photos to be viewed.
Finally, there's Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children under 8), the five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before time runs out, which is great for an impromptu spelling bee.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores just to see what's on offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online pet in Club Penguin, you can, for example, buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children 6 to 12), which includes a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will get enough credits at the Club Penguin Store for two more parts.
It could be roller skates or a puffle-cloth animal.
The latest head-cell-powered micro-robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children 5 and up) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of clumps.
And he's been through a lot.
Our dog fell off the kitchen table and even survived for a while in our dog's mouth.
Police operations in China are softening
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked across a city square, checking on his nervous subordinates, giving orders with military authority and a muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's tough-guarded urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and penchant for violence - to impress the viewers.
"Stay where you are!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them", he whispered, "how pretty girls they are!"
Four girls, barely out of their teens, wearing white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood up.
Four pairs of black pumps were standing in a straight line.
Four neat hats fit perfectly on the blue-and-white striped loops.
"They look average to me", Mr. Tang remarks scornfully.
"Models are pretty".
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a college degree.
The Guangdong province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the gray-green.
In Wuhan, central China, violence was replaced by silence: In 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled a car that was not properly set up and stared at the operator until he packed up and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with a population of 680,000, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have joined the city's police force, selected for their looks, good figure and youth.
They're supposed to give the rough police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would be unable to improve the bad image the Chinese have of these city commandos.
The critics are right.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce city laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely portray a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei province beat a spectator to death when he filmed them with his cell phone as they crushed a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing officials was stolen and posted online, describing how to beat criminals without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after shaking hands with five officials.
A violent video game, available for download, shows trained Chinese officials attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan is scaring the government", the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The paper called for a "really thorough cleanup".
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district advertised for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real duties or were just to serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 were being sought with good figure and "harmonious facial features".
They should be above average - over five feet, two and a half inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
According to officials, the work is too physically demanding for women over 25.
"The most important thing is their image", an unnamed district official told the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first of all on their external appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc".
Then there's temperament and "inner qualities".
"Chengguan women are like flower pots", he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other duties".
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district municipal administration, does not want to endorse this description,
But he admitted that in China, size-specific job ads for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this is the same as good looks is a matter of debate in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disfigurements don't have to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use cripples or humpbacks here", Mr. Zheng said.
"Your image would be bad".
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple pie and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn't feel it was sexist that so much attention was paid to her looks.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with a wry look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city".
They said they did not regret the short-term appointment because they had more ambitious career plans than simply scaring dealers through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the police deal with about a dozen street vendors who try to sell as many buns and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bicycle before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here".
"We've told you so many times!" Ms. Xu explains to a trader who had fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle-mounted bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the work is rather monotonous than exhausting.
"It's almost the same every day", explains Huang Jing, 20, a student of sales in her spare time.
"All the routine".
One reason is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchants' goods, as their male counterparts are.
The only way to threaten criminals is to report them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostility, which officials in China often face.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, marched after a rumor spread that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police and Chenguan officials were injured in the nighttime incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared such violent outbursts.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baonguang Square where the female officers were patrolling that morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that had been repaired on the sidewalk, not in a garage, in violation of regulations.
The owner was yelling Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the grim-faced officers made their way to their vehicles and continued on with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male police coordinator, stayed behind, turning his white name tag over to remain anonymous.
Like their female colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we're verbally ahead".
"Sometimes physically", Mr Li explains soberly.
"Most of the time, people start with the fight".
The prosecution will not prosecute Senator Ensign.
Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of charges brought against him following his affair with a former campaign aide and his attempt to lobby her husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada, until the scandal that made national headlines and put his career on hold, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "very pleased" with the verdict after a year of investigation.
The Senate ethics committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigation of Senator Ensign had been discontinued and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The verdict came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who felt there was enough evidence to show that Ensign had violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents first published in the New York Times in October 2009 suggested that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his campaign aides, was helping to secure lucrative contracts to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife, Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was a treasurer for Ensign during the campaign.
Ensign contacted some of his political friends to get Hampton work, and according to the records and interviews, he lobbied for them after Hampton was hired.
Since Hampton was recently on Ensign's campaign team, he was not allowed to do any lobbying work for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called prohibition of the revolving door lobby.
According to the published evidence, "it appears to be a conspiracy and a violation of the revolving door statutes", says Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Justice Department has refused to officially disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics attorneys said the department appears to be very cautious in pursuing political charges after a slew of defeats that were followed with great interest by the media, including last year's decision to drop charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrible", said Melanie Sloan, chairwoman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an organization that aims to combat corruption in U.S. congressional and governmental bodies, a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign.
"This means that, in principle, senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, telling him that the department would not file any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he had put forward to the prosecutors.
"I am not comfortable going into the details of the discussions between the Ministry of Justice and myself, but let me just say that we believe we have made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to shut down the investigation over a separate lawsuit by the Ethics Committee alleging that a $96,000 payment by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The Election Commission said there was not enough evidence to prove that the money was anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada firm that has long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbying work with the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after the firm continued Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was "knocking" at the Home Office about a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also meeting Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton had been hired to lobby.
When information about this affair first became public last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his Senate seat, where he had been ranked fourth in the Republican primary.
After months of being out of the limelight, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of a police investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes the ethics committee will follow the Justice Department's lead and stop its investigation very soon.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in service to the people of Nevada", she said.
Cheshire call to action on Twitter
Half a dozen of them were running away in the courtroom riot.
Within minutes, they were tweeting their reports of gruesome testimony.
In the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter posts about the trial of rape and children chained to beds in a house that burned down.
On Thursday, the closely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut, family, will officially end when the jury's verdict of death is rendered.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed petitions in court setting out grounds for an appeal, which will keep the courts occupied for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense reporting of the trial - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and a widespread, immediate penetration of insurrectionary details, so that the jury was unduly influenced by the public outrage.
This objection could lead the courts of appeal to consider whether new technologies will necessitate new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this trial, I believe that there is a real danger when the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial", said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' lead attorney.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Superior Court, struck down the motions in a brief and unambiguous decision last week, saying that the new media would be "carefully monitored" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that certainly was not the final word on the matter.
For decades, court decisions have found that the coverage of high-profile cases raises questions about the fairness of a trial.
In its landmark 1966 decision, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who allegedly killed his wife, saying in its decision that New Media had created a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom".
Some people believe that the TV series and the movie "On the Run" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court appeals reviewing Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom, which were unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media on trials that are followed by a broad public", said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut, and whose report says that it is arbitrary.
Professor Donohue said some appellate courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make trials fairer.
The Twitter incident is just one of many that Mr. Hayes' lawyers are presenting to debate for years, thus delaying a conviction.
The defendants also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been convicted when Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, filled them with disgust.
The defendants say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge mistakenly replaced a juror who had been a critic of the prosecution and that he had unreasonably pressured the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jury was not isolated.
But perhaps the most interesting is their argument about the impact of extensive reporting on the trial.
In a challenge to the verdict they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was being discussed by candidates for governor and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continually rekindled the flames of emotion about the case.
"Such a daily rush of media beepers, cameras, and reporters outside the courtroom", the lawyers wrote, "has never been seen before in New Haven and perhaps in the entire country".
Her focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more provocative than reports that are relayed more slowly is a hostile view that impoverishes the reporting of future trials.
But some lawyers said that appellate courts often face the argument that social and technical changes require court adaptation.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers corroborate that claim.
In their appeal, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction for reporting and made it clear that the New Media requires new rules.
"This case", they wrote, "represents Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century".
Can courtesy connect the dots?
After a campaign of profanity and negativity, little courtesy has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of real bipartisan cooperation or a moment of illusion before quickly returning to the battle of the parties in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and top congressional officials did not break through the big issues that were being addressed during the so-called lame duck session, the session at the end of a term in which no decisions are made.
From what I hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different parties nor a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partial point-setting.
The public meeting of the President's deficit committee on Wednesday was likewise civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months builds up a mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to divide the members.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - one demanding from the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while the other is trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a new party war.
The meeting itself and the participants' assessment of it were therefore limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health care or expectations, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election was a mild one in Washington, at least for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed", said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions that die off again.
And that's good".
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution".
Bush's tax cuts are due to expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both sides want to find a way to keep some or all of them, whether temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on the unemployment pay raise is to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favoured tax cuts are for the rich while denying support to unemployed workers.
After the meeting at the White House on Tuesday, there was increased optimism that these issues could be agreed during the lame duck session and at the same time the New START Treaty could be ratified.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on pressing issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress convenes in January".
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation", he said.
We are also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that politeness leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what happens between now and 2012 as a pre-game, or shadow box, for the main event of 2012", he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the makeup of the new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who served their formation.
As concerned as Republican leaders may be about playing too high a bet, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut government spending and overturn health care reform.
These party lines are already evident in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing public expenditure.
Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington, and have, in their own judgment, pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 out of 18 votes in the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are struggling to get anywhere near that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, because in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two stages in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes, with Republicans challenging Obama over the budget, taxes and health care system, followed later by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will bring about this change?
The public opinion.
It's been proven that, despite the partisan nature of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, both parties must be careful about the public reaction.
Whoever is doomed to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
The bias and polarization is greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it seems to be a greater ideological divide between Obama and congressional Republicans than it was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far more consequential 2012 election.
In this respect, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city is controlled by the "kleptocracy", which passes on part of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in a memo in February.
Both the police and the State Security Service are alleged to be extorting large amounts of protection money to keep up their expensive standard of living in Moscow.
They're not just collecting money from legitimate businesses, but also from organized crime gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "verticals of authority" - takes its share of the money that moves the ladder upward.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that he has been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption charges over the years, and he has won numerous libel cases against such accusations.
In September, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he told a Russian TV station: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's filthy".
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual for individual persons to be mentioned, as is the case in the Ambassador's report, and it is unheard of for a diplomat of a foreign country to do so.
"The direct link between the Moscow government and crime has led some to call it 'disturbed' and conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government", the memo said.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'kryshna' (a term from the criminal/mafia world, literally meaning 'roof' or 'protection') that extends through the police, the State Security Service (FSB), the Service Supervision Authority (MVD), the Prosecutor's Office as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-tiered structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top".
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level".
"Last in line are the common criminals and the lowest level criminal inspectors".
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help".
The report goes on to say that the FSB is collecting money from the biggest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, it is said, "explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), not only because they have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law".
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer as much in demand as it once was".
The memo notes that while the fundraising is extensive, the protection itself may be very modest none; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - on one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The embassy memo contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases, presumably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats", Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow-based expert commission, said in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy".
"It is not part of the political class, because a political class no longer exists in Russia".
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the nongovernmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The disclosure of the US embassy memo, which happened late in the evening Moscow time, will certainly cause discontent within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's mistakes, it may also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that it is solving the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents may be a forgery and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats had called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country", he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know".
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and leafy walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people", said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longtime supporters in Anlong Veng are being challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time told the story of the Khmer Rouge to former soldiers' children.
And in July, a joint UN-Cambodian tribunal sentenced for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Alnlong Veng, hampering their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything", said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that studies the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil".
"It even divides families".
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork, or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border into Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok raised the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to turn to the government, leading to the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not relented, was arrested by government forces in 1999 in the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
When their supporters no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the wretched poverty of rural Cambodia, and many retained the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local government posts because they laid down their arms, the common soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the capitulation", said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are rooted in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime".
"They grew up with no professional skills".
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the RHM as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good", he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat".
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves".
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also caused concern here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife to justice, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to convict the old leaders and those primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it has not been said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
This has done little to ease the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told officials at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that is believed to have killed thousands of forced laborers.
One hot evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court were to summon her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability", she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become precarious if the court charged more suspects, although experts and historians debate this.
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past", he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means putting the broken pieces together", he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand everything".
The Centre produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page History of Democratic Cambodia.
It distributed the book in Anlong Veng in June as an appendix to the Ministry of Education's High School History Book, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Vale Touchak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court", he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be sentenced by the court".
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are gradually gaining influence", he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a powerful pull here.
High in the Dangrek Mountains, a path covered with bushes and littered with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was cremated here on a pile of tires after he died in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a street vendor, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray", she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where she would lay a bush of ripe bananas - hoping it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to stop stockpiling weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure global nuclear materials, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus not to continue to stockpile highly enriched uranium, and it seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements were made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - about £500, according to an official, who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama's April "47 Nations Nuclear Security Summit", which excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012)".
"This proves to me that it works", said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basically weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium", Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we will not make dirty bombs out of it and we will not sell it to anyone".
"We're using it for research purposes only, that's all".
The European Union is not a member of the European Union, and we are not a member of the European Union.
The first attempt to remove Belarus' uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by air, according to the officials.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for this effort, with much of the money going into Belarusian research into low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust", which led to the agreement that Clinton signed, said Andrew Bieniawski, a spokesman for the Department of Energy working on Global Hazard Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimates that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus intends to dismantle its stockpile by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenka's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
"Welcoming the progress made on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus declare that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme in the improvement of bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens", it explains.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flying Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. Embassy in Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents leaked by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper El País (by cable), adding that former Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored".
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing the aid of practices that degrade human rights in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega met.
The Deputy Prime Minister admitted that the Council's report "had caught Zapatero off guard" and reiterated that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory".
"They just want to be informed", so as not to be "surprised unprepared", Aguirre reports by cable.
Former Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also told the Ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence because it is in the hands of the judges".
In January 2007, the Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Central Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information", the ambassador said after speaking with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information from the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maintain discretion between governments", Aguirre laments.
At a March 2007 lunch attended by the US Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely concerned about their independence and doing what they think is appropriate", he had instructed his staff to avoid "bloated rhetorical comments to defuse tensions".
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach in this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt, from a hint that the Zapatero government has tolerated or willfully ignored actions by the US that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, will capitalize even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government", he stresses.
The child killer confesses to complaining on the Internet about the "torture" of motherhood.
The young woman talked about the child when it was already dead and she had a blog called "Terror in the Galician way".
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet as "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she has used since she was a child, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend, both from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The messages are from 2008.
To understand them, one must know their love life, which the ABC daily reconstructs on the basis of testimonies from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman started a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
It lasted a year.
Shortly after she broke up with him, it was revealed that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex-wife never let him do a DNA analysis.
Soon after, she entered into another relationship.
The one chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
Cesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of her messages, it seems that their love relationship broke down and they separated.
In March 2008, she was alone in Menorca and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work".
"When I told him, he was fine, but now he's obviously realizing what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not be free to do and not do what he wants".
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address where I can send the boy to you".
She complains: "If he doesn't like it when I leave the boy with my mother, I'll come back and pick him up".
She says of returning to her village in May: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to go to work on the 20th if I don't want to lose it".
She explains that she will take her firstborn if all goes well.
"He'll be with the one he needs to be with, which is me, and I'll never let him be with anyone else in my life except my mother", a dubious intention, considering their bad relationship.
There's another mail in July.
As she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who arrived on the island on the first of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, he is not".
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes it a little bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day".
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He'll be attending a summer school there, so I'll have less to spend on babysitting".
17th: Memories and mourning.
"A giant kiss from César, asking me when you're coming".
"Alberto says he's been e-mailing me some videos, you know, if he wants to find me, he'll find me, so shit".
On the 30th, another: "The boy is doing well. He's going to a summer course to learn Catalan".
There's one from her current partner, Victor: "He's throwing money at me".
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages about her.
She even had her own MySpace blog, which is now blocked, and in it she called herself "Muki the Prison Break".
"Terror a la gallega" (title) is the title of the book.
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting officer, says he has a guilty conscience.
He can't believe it happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mom.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to grant the aid to the victims of the attack.
The defence attorney, Carlos Maceda, said she could not remember the circumstances of the incident, "and she had no intention of harming the little one".
Before that, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and hiding his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecution requested a psychiatric opinion.
The Partido Popular won four seats in Congress and the PSC lost nine.
The results of 28 November could be a decisive factor in the development of the PP in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - whether early or not - and its expectations are more than positive, as the number of votes this party receives in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while in the 2006 regional elections it received only 316,222.
On Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - a result of the PSC's vote-share diversion and the PP's voter-leaning - continues, PP analysts predict that in the general election the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 MPs, while CiU would gain four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (out of 25).
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party's analysis, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while ICV could keep its MP or gain one.
If the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date will be the May 2011 municipal elections, and the People's Party (PP) will be the language of the balance to end the socialist domination in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists neither win a majority nor can rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not unlikely that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council, where it would have to win 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its share of the vote in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The Nationalists are convinced that they can play a major role in the transformation of Tarragona, where they had governed together with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC.The mayor, Ángel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last election campaign.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus, the Popular Party also recorded significant growth.
The PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and is seeking to establish lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by the Barcelona police secret service were part of the Thailand-controlled jihadist cell that provided passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the Liberation Movement of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and Laschkar e-Taiba (Let), the latter of which was responsible for the bombings in Bombay in 2008 that claimed 106 lives.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, to the point of assuring that the "Operation Kampai" has "weakened" the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda worldwide and "thereby its ability to act".
The researchers estimate that during the two years the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries with impunity.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network active in Europe, which is why other European police units have also been involved in the investigation, besides the Thai investigating authorities.
In coordination with this operation (the arrest of Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another was carried out in Thailand, which arrested Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt, and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They had run the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network, part of which was dismantled in 2009, stole passports from tourists in particular, according to the guidelines of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This meant that the documents had to be issued in the names of men aged 25 to 45 and be valid for several years; they were not allowed to bear visa stamps.
Investigators stress that so far no links have been established between the arrests in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay, although the perpetrator of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipients of the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that several days before the attack in Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent via a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "commando" that ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized a large amount of documentation.
PP demands that Mas postpone the tax agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present Artur Mas personally her conditions for his inauguration as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are not different from those already set out during the election campaign and can be summed up by the priority of economic recovery and the abandonment of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial settlement agreement, which the regionalist leader intends to propose at the height of his mandate.
The chairman of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas with the assurance that he had won the 18 seats she had won last Sunday - a figure more than enough to make her feel indispensable, because the candidate from the CiU party, a bourgeois regionalist party, is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties to vote when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to form in the upcoming parliamentary elections depend on a possible agreement with the PP.
As for the PPC party chairwoman, she is demanding that "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial settlement between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the Basque Country - and which the CiU party leader even wants to submit to a referendum - be put on the back burner to support the inauguration.
The two leaders have in common the desire to streamline the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration and to abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations for Mas's accession are being examined by Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat from the PPC.
Mr Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV).Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidarity Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of Olot nursing home do not rule out that their caregiver killed over 11 elderly people
The officials of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) held a press conference yesterday, in which they highlighted the damage caused to the institution by the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés, the caregiver who killed at least 11 elderly people in his care during his work.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in court with his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced, "La Caritat wants to prosecute those responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our obligation to accept liability compels us to accept the process and the civil liability".
The institution not only has to accept a loss of social reputation for not having detected the criminal acts of the carer in time, but now also has to pay a large sum of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime was committed in August 2009 and that he has continued to kill since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased but that the formalities had been carried out by telephone because of their age and illnesses.
The head of La Caritat flatly denied this point, stating that "lack of action could never have been the cause of the incidents".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there was no evidence of negligence by any person other than the defendant in the litigation".
The "angel of death" confessed to 11 murders the day before, claiming to have committed the first on August 29, 2009, and to have murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime, in which he administered a mixture of different tranquilizers.
The head of La Caritat explained that the access of the staff to the medicines was difficult to control.
The nurse used insulin injections and the sedative cocktail in six of nine crimes committed to relieve the dying patients of their suffering.
But the results of the lab tests will reveal whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them from the inside out by administering bleach to them, as he did, according to his confession, to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
La Caritat does not believe the nurse's testimony, not even about the number of murders he confessed, which could be many more, and justifies this attitude by saying that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threats by the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our reactivity".
The risk prerequisites of the euro periphery countries have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be wrong and that the euro has scarcely gained any points, which is a cause for concern.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market which recovers to the extent that it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, which means that the ECB will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank demanded that the plan to buy government debt be terminated as it was ineffective and that all exceptional temporary liquidity measures be abolished, with only one week's unlimited access to the bank.
In the wake of the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended 'at least until March' and the quarterly open tenders at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity to be maintained at least until June.
We also expect the bond purchase programme to continue and to send a stronger signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent market reaction of yesterday will be thrown back and if we are stubbornly pressed to withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, when the ECB reiterated that it was not considering buying government bonds and the markets collapsed, the same story could happen again tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new market crash.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year government bonds in Portugal was rather weak.
The State Treasury only spent 500 million at 5.28%, compared to 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a change in market perceptions, as Trichet said.
In Ireland, the debt-loss figures were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at about 10 billion short-term and possibly another 15 billion.
Although Ireland has lost all credibility after failing to identify the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment, which is to be adopted by the Council on 1 January.
Angela Merkel has made her speech more moderate in view of the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, where political unity is called for to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
The Spanish Prime Minister presented yesterday the action plan, which will be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
The Commission is also aware of the need to improve the quality of the services provided by the European Investment Bank, and of the need to ensure that the European Investment Bank is able to meet the needs of the European Union.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has risen by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Compared with February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
We are now in the midst of a major auction of a three-year government bond which will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we are betting on a strong demand which will remove all doubts about our ability to restructure.
For Spain, applying for an aid scheme would be a self-sacrifice.
We would have liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely high and access to the markets would be closed indefinitely.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar's wife's motto: "Now it's not just being that matters, it's appearance".
We can do this!
The CEO of Oulen challenged the Vega Sicilia shareholders' meeting at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the Eulen and El Enebro companies, is not abating.
David Álvarez, founder of the company group, will challenge the general meeting of El Enebro, which will be held on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, considering it "absolutely null" and his children will try to gain a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia winery.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal proceedings for a new chapter in their dispute over control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest holding company for corporate services does not seem willing to give in to his legal battle for control of the El Enebro organs.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who appointed themselves to the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting of 18 January of this year, which is already registered in the Commercial Register as contested.
The general meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the arms of the Álvarez family.
The only legal way to ensure the convening of the general meeting is by calling the general meeting.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicant - his five children - to get the annulled assembly of 18 January recognized by means of legal cunning, fraudulent schemes and abuse of law", as official spokesmen explain.
This argument is the basis for the subsequent challenge to the assembly to declare it 'absolutely null'.
The same protagonists, who are quietly silent, tried unsuccessfully to convene a meeting by judicial means in June.
At El Enebro - the asset management company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, the founder of the service group claims, according to the family protocols, the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
That is the real background to the case which the judge is to decide at the hearing on the appeal, for which no date has yet been fixed.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are being upgraded with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this exquisite universe has been marked by speed of surprise and success.
At first, no one paid attention to the newcomer, and despite his steep climb during the last seasons, everyone bet on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari at the final lap last November.
Without wanting to diminish the skills of German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon" that put the Multi Siemens Red Bull in its hands and thus created a winning team has become a legend.
In reality, it is a high-performance process simulation software that the German company launched in 2007 for non-race-related purposes.
This computer program, known as PLM, has been used to develop assembly lines in factories around the world, power plants, and high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce or simulate a product or process accurately before it is actually built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of Siemens' Industrial Division, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Red Bull Factory can design and implement the changes and improvements that are detected in races and tests "in a matter of hours, almost in real time".
Russwurm states that in 1992 the racetracks had an average of ten technicians who could introduce no more than three or four improvements in a single season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly skilled young people, who use powerful computer systems to analyse and make any possible changes to the race cars.
The Siemens manager stated that the PLM software was capable of analysing and improving all components of Red Bull racing cars, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault claimed sole responsibility.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are being changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this mad technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula One team is allowed to spend on its races in a season.
Red Bull has set up its high-tech factory for the development and production of its racing cars in a location 30 miles from London.
These are two buildings where visits, particularly by journalists, are severely restricted.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The crew consists of 580 people, including the two pilots, world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true F1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion, Sebastian Vetell.
The enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts into the services of its participation on the racetracks hide other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose notoriety is almost zero.
The plant's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, points out that five years ago, you could say that the advances in R&D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory, and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed, with technology accounting for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computers, because they "are unpredictable gladiators".
HP to open 20 locally owned stores in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a network of 20 stores, each of which will cover 80 to 100 square metres, which Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company is coordinating this initiative with the 16 existing sales areas in the multi-brand operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-Chair of HP España, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted Gran Vía store in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group intends to establish 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, 20 of which will be in Spain.
The first were opened last week in Bucharest, Romania, and Belgrade, Serbia.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming reopening, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The vice-chairwoman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening a store is always the same, based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products to touch).
HP is also responsible for training shop staff.
Mr Helena Herrero said that this was not a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive sales network was intended to "optimize customer service and advice for SMEs during and after purchases, even packaging".
The Barcelona store has a pioneering pilot programme which guarantees the technical solutions to HP equipment.
An online service is being set up to connect the technical headquarters in Maastricht, the Netherlands.
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days".
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro enterprises and private customers, as large enterprises already have their technical customer service contracts", explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal a million customers from its rival in three years
The CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers, believing that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he foresees a breakdown in interest rates, which banks will try to compensate for by raising fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a still-existing business.
Sabadell has found a way to make the most of the next three years and survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year master plan in 2011.
The objective is not only to survive without the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of one million private customers - 700,000, minus the customers the bank will lose - which is the major challenge facing the bank, because so far it has paid more attention to its commercial customers than to its private customers.
This year it has added 250 000 private customers and 50 000 businesses.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5%, while business customers account for more than 10%.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the global financial crisis has disrupted all plans of the banks.
Sabadell will complete its Optima guidance plan, which was initially designed for three years, but which has been extended for one financial year in the light of the market situation.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main target of the bank.
At a breakfast organised by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a great reach".
The manager expects Spain to emerge from the crisis "slowly".
It would also be "very difficult" to "create jobs" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if he expects the war on liabilities - which is punishing interest margins - to fade, the risk premia that banks and savings banks have to pay for their issues to maintain liquidity will already be rolled over to the price of loans as a compensation for diminishing margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and will put pressure on lending".
"We haven't turned the corner, but the interest differentials are very high", Guardiola admitted.
Banesto had already issued an order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest rates (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the strategy of "increasing fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's business plan is based on organic growth, although the group does not exclude corporate business as usual.
He is not in vain saying that in Spain "bigger enterprises are needed".
"Everything will change next year", he assures.
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "enormously increasing" and did not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into the red.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market in capital increases.
After assuring that Sabadell could survive a temporary market shutdown, he dismisses the argument of some bankers who already predict a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing could be obtained through repurchase transactions and thus the crisis could be contained.
CECA rules out a second wave of mergers of savings banks
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a wave of mergers of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the sector was being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several of them decided not to participate in the first phase, but they decided to opt for the second round.
The Spanish Savings Bank Association (CECA) Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, however, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed.The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, but rather as adjustments".
"Most of it is done. It may be that instead of seventeen we have thirteen or fourteen, but all the important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by the Banco de España, which has strongly supported all the processes".
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta said that the concentration process had been completed "as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timeliness which was set in earlier times, not now, in the framework of the business plans with Banco de España".
"The move from 45 savings banks with an average assets of 28 000 million to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically unprecedented process.The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62% and they are now much larger, which is how we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement", he stressed.
Olavarrieta explained that "there were a number of persistent opinions about the slow pace of the process, which revealed lack of seriousness and nonsense" because "Banco de España urges us to complete the process on time before the end of the year".
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financial systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the world, adding that those who question it would be doing so "without any deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic downturn, we "do not have to worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very significant" concentration process, which will be completed "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has decided to keep the euro, but at the same time it has set conditions for the whole European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a twofold response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment or the abolition of the 426 euro allowance for unemployed persons who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the administration of the Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Prime Minister, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the one responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is foreseen that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany is taking a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the preservation of the long-standing traditions of many of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area.
The second is the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark, which, although it sounds like science fiction at the moment, is supported by a large part of the public, about 50 percent of the population.
The third is to reform the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishing countries that break the rules; possibly suspending payments to some countries and extending the cost of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been for some time now, so there are no excuses.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created deficit incentives and the German government pulled out of the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was the Central European country, when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to rescue Greece.
At the time, this was heavily criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion, was absolutely against a bailout of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel has again come out with a clear position: she is calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable the rescue of a country while at the same time obliging private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it fuelled the Irish crisis and all that followed.
But their proposal, albeit a bit sweet, was accepted and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union which will enable these measures to be implemented from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line which it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures must be taken now - the old way of working of the euro will no longer exist from this date on.
2013 will be the birth of a new currency area, where countries that do not comply will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare insolvency, and in this case the private sector will have to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we must pursue a hard course of growth, with high saving and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and building with huge holes in the balance of payments, as suggested by Spain during the boom years, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would be bad at not understanding it.
It's not just about bringing the deficit down to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope the current turmoil will turn into a more calm one.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that are offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in one's own home has begun to take shape.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like anything will change.
Among the possibilities considered is that we should have to leave the euro area, which is full of countries with little standing.
In that case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sports and circumvention
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to evade a penalty.
The alleged suspension of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 Champions League match against Ajax has led to much speculation about whether or not it was an unsportsmanlike act and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is common knowledge, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already won clearly) and played several fouls to get the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfil the prescribed sanction in the next league game against Auxerre and thus enter the next stage of play without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee fined the club's coach, José Mourinho, two games and the players involved different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules that are followed in this sport.
Part of the debate over the case depicted is due to the fact that a team from the football club Real Madrid (which preys on nobility and honor in its anthem and has punished its players on other occasions for similar incidents) played the lead role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who has added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
The debate is, in any event, whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute an evasion of the rules.
The damage to sporting spirit should be investigated.
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect which was not compromised by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of clean play is to prevent the opposing players from taking unjustified advantage of the opposing team.
The paradox of the actions of the Real Madrid players is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand as foul play or circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule was not committed in secret to avoid a penalty, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders derived from the intentional fouls.
It should be emphasised that neither the rival was put at a disadvantage nor any advantage was claimed for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club doesn't have those players.
The obvious advantage is that players start the next round of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it's a long-term advantage, to a certain degree uncertain, because the team could eventually be eliminated, and also the players get a penalty and go into the second card cycle, where they are eliminated because they accumulate one card less than in the first cycle.
It is not clear whether this is really an advantage.
In the end, such approaches are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which includes strategic decisions to get the most out of the regulations.
In this case, the players did not want to avoid a penalty (which would actually be a clear case of breach), they wanted to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without evading or fleeing punishment.
Although the line between patenting and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of patenting.
I have the impression that the controversy arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the type of rule transfer provoked.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is less of an ethical nature than of an aesthetic one.
The bidding campaign for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar has caused an avalanche of reservations this year on December 16 and 17.
The parties paid for by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the run-up to Christmas, which fuel Barcelona's restaurant and leisure industry, but as a result of the economic crisis they are triggering a price campaign to catch the large customer segment: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
To complicate the accounting a bit more, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders to the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations on two top floors (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon this tradition, many workers pay for it out of their own pocket.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances.
The representative of the umbrella association has not yet dared to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think it over ten times before they make a reservation".
"They like to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to prices", he says.
Business will be good for those who "offer quality at good prices with good service", he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices around €25 are most in demand.
A survey of several central restaurants shows that the evening of December 17th is leading to the collapse of the vendors.
The Soteras Group says that demand for this Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, will be booming.
Another leading group, Andilana, which operates 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has seen the peculiarity of the calendar lead to early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste ranging from 19.95 to 30 euros", he explains.
AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 shops, is not losing its optimism after the second quarter saw revenues return to a flourishing state and good prospects for Christmas business, albeit concentrated on a few days.
Sources in the group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating before Christmas.
The six group menus have been supplemented by a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more as a price hit, giving the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than last year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies, green shoots are also seen sprouting, which gives the impression that the group meals are back on the upswing.
On the other side of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with affiliates such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the Vice-President, Enric Gomà, is confident that he can see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "vibrant" overall, although the customers "make a maximum".
But the fun of the party hasn't diminished, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program is a matter of great concern in the United States
Islamabad is making nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
WikiLeaks revelations confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by the Wikileaks website, confirm the enormous concern Washington has over Pakistan's nuclear program.
Besides the clarifying and juicy details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not being strengthened but, on the contrary, is "decreasing", and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled but are stored in order to make it more difficult to destroy them in the event of a possible attack - is causing Washington to have sleepless nights.
In a report before the visit of former National Security Council chief James Jones, Ambassador Anne W. Patterson in Pakistan lists the following risks: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the likely dispersal of nuclear material and the vulnerability of nuclear material transport".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is no longer seen as excessive and a reason for caution by the United States and Russia.
"Pakistan needs to recruit strictly religious personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or missile programs", said Yuri Korolev, an expert from the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
What's new about the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's web portal is that the cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation is waning and the pace at which Pakistan is building nuclear weapons is increasing.
In May, an embassy office, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", said: "There is often no transparency; offers of help are not answered or rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a South Asia intelligence official, confirms that "despite economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at the fastest rate of any other country".
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington to "clear" to the commander-in-chief during a visit by the commander-in-chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, that "Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support of terrorist groups".
In the hunt for the WikiLeaks boss
Obama appoints a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further revelations.
Interpol is issuing a red alert to track down and locate Assange.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated maze in which the facts are difficult to unravel.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red alert" for the "finding and prosecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
Nor does it have to do with the recent disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the sexual abuse allegations the Australian has to face in Sweden.
The lawyer for the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, also assures that "the police would know where and how to contact Mr Assange".
The international police authority based in Lyon, France, issued the order on 20th July at the request of Sweden, but it was not made public until yesterday after receiving the authorization from the Swedish authorities.
The 188 countries of Interpol are instructed to identify and locate Assange "in order to arrest him and extradite him".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual under a red alert, many member states consider the red alert a release for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move outraged Assange's lawyers, who gestured a letter informing them that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder was willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested to leave Sweden and was given permission by the prosecutor, who is compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal prosecution", the letter accuses.
While the world is searching for him - and his mother from Australia is asserting her son's innocence - Assange is in an unknown location, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype from an undisclosed location, in which he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN, in violation of international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign", he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website", he told CNN.
Obama himself has appointed a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to reduce the attention paid to Assange is in stark contrast to the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee starting in January, has urged the State Department to investigate the possibility of listing WikiLeaks as a terrorist organization "to seize its funds and prosecute anyone who supports or contributes to it".
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, went further, and had to retract his statement that Assange had to be "murdered".
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and use a drone or something".
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever leaked information to the government is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution is too mild a punishment", he told Fox News.
Puigcercós looks with a wink at the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret vote on his continuance in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the principle of the plenary assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the tenth time an internal riot in the ranks of the ERC, which has lost 11 deputies and half the votes.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for those close to former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weak as its mentor himself and will not give him the same headache as other former currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra is trying to win over the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For starters, yesterday he announced that the more than 200 regional councillors of the ERC could speak in secret about his continuing in office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the carodians wanted to pass a ticket to the president, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the impression of division and submission in his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would not feel confirmed with half the votes plus one, and he added without stating percentages that a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
Carod's supporters are demanding more from the president than just the party's handing over his office, a gesture that is not enough given Puigcercós' control of the highest body of Congress.
But since they don't have a majority to force resignations, they'll agree with the board on a course of action between now and May.
They expect to be able to contribute to the preparation of the strategic reorientation document which the management will submit to the Council for a vote on 18 December.
They intend to vouch for Puigcercós, who in return is expected to promise to move the congress to autumn 2011, which the party leadership already considers a fact.
The ERC's party chairman believes that "polyphony" is detrimental to stability and he is seeking to make the organization able once and for all to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting Consul Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman is supported "in exchange for different goals".
He listed five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, which means including new faces from Carod's circle.
The second one could be the big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should finally abandon the principle of the plenary as a way of functioning.
He is thus advocating a reform of the statutes to enable congresses to be held with elected delegates.
The end of the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is a source of obsession for Puigcercós' team, which has been fighting for it at the last two congresses.
In fact, at the 2008 trembling assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of the plenary assembly at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
The deadline has not yet been set, as the internal turmoil of recent years has made it unwise to deal with this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on the lookout, it might be time to take up this matter again and shut it down for good.
23 killed in November, 290 in 2010
According to the count of MILENIO, there were four fewer cases in Mexico than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in Mexico, according to MILENIO México, four fewer than the previous month.
Among the murdered are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, we have a total of 390 deaths, presumably related to organized crime.

The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on Mixtecas Road in the Santa Cruz Acatlán neighborhood of Naucalpan.
Early Thursday, the 4th, farm workers found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shots in the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway on the section that runs through the village of Villa Guerrero.
A note was found beside the body, presumably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was shot eight times after leaving his home to do his job as a garbage man.
On November 7, two 30-year-old men died from gunshot wounds to the head in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc neighborhood of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro, the body of a man with a gunshot wound to the forehead was found on a deserted path in the settlement of El Naranjo, and under the body a shell casing fired from a caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewage drainage of the Playa Golondrina settlement.
Emergency services searched for the rest of the body parts, but they didn't find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported the discovery of a body they had discovered in the area of Peña Colorada, with its hands tied back and its head tied.
The man had a gunshot wound to the neck.
In mid-month, two men were reported murdered, wrapped in blankets and found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in Tizapán de Zaragoza, and two death threats were found alongside the victims.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes in the town of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a note signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two women were found dead, wrapped in blankets, in the village of Zoquiapan, in the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, the body of a man, wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, was found, who, according to the note left by his murderers, was probably named Mario Ríos.
In the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman with gunshot wounds to the neck was found.
Tattoos of Santa Muerte and chains with corresponding images were found on the woman's skin.
In the last six months, a man's body was found next to a vehicle in the municipality of Zinacantepec, with at least three shots and a note signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads covered with tape and a message were discovered in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the body was a note, presumably signed by a criminal organization, that said, "This is what happens to those who don't join".
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found bound at hands and feet with marks of torture inside a taxi parked behind the San Agustín settlement's justice center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first was beheaded in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón and was bound in black plastic bags, with a message next to it.
The police found a cardboard box with a note next to it.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of China stated at COP16 that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and would maintain its promise to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China is keeping its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to transform its industry.
He explained that over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
He said China would not change its goals but would work with the international community on this issue.
He explained that China's strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
He said progress had been made in all areas, including the adoption of a new energy law last year which included targets for reducing emissions of gases.
On the other hand, it pointed out that in China, the state authorities had worked with the central government and the municipalities to achieve the energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction targets.
He also pointed out that several multiannual plans had already been started or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those receiving funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which had been launched over the past five years and had received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and private hands.
He said that a project on climate change was also under way at provincial level, another on replacing traditional light bulbs with energy-saving ones and another on mitigation and adaptation.
Martin Krol, the government's scientific adviser on climate change, confirmed that China's efforts are far greater than is commonly believed.
He pointed out that per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for nine percent of the total contribution to environmental pollution.
He also said that the country was making unprecedented progress in energy use, with energy efficiency increasing by 20% over the past five years and another increase by 2020.
Legal exclusion from Espinos:
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former Panist party chairman has the right to turn to the National Order Commission and demand what the law would grant him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legitimate and that the former PAN party chairman had the right to appeal to the National Commission for Order and demand what the law granted him.
In an interview before the appeal, Gabino Cué Monteagudos, as governor of the state, stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision by the Sonoran Law Commission".
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal his case to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision by a competent body", he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not the time to think about 2012 and that an alliance of presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge stronger from the internal vote on December 4 and 5, when his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, we enjoy it and it strengthens us", he commented.
He said that the council would undoubtedly choose the best chairman Acción Nacional needed for the next three years, so he would hand over the reins "to the one the council would appoint".
"I am quite unconcerned and open. I would be proud to give each of the five the office of party chairman".
He predicted that the party's upturn in the last 4 July elections would be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not the time to think about 2012".
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would be the flag bearers and observed throughout the country.
When asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his discourse during his four-year government, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the Zedillo and Salinas governments were better than the Fox and Calderón governments, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet", he reiterated.
He believes that the Federal Government could use such expressions as those he used in his speech at the National Auditorium, because in this country there would be no ban on speech, much less censorship.
Obama takes to Twitter to advocate for the law on behalf of undocumented students
"If you are for the passing of the Dream Act, call your senators and urge the passing of this law", the president of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today backed the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - the law that legalizes undocumented students - with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you're in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the passage of this bill", Obama tweeted.
His brief includes a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document urging the public to contact their senators immediately as the bill is about to be voted on.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you", he stresses.
The news spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes on any bill except for expanding the Bush tax cuts and expanding government funding.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the passage of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
When asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be drawn up for the remaining projects.
"I think we have plenty of time"...
"We all agree that the tax issue must be resolved by the end of the year"...
"I think we can agree on that at any time and then we can plan the rest", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would "request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act, which would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students, could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act - the American Dream Act - would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States before the age of 16, who have lived in this country for the past five years and are enrolled in a higher education institution or in the military.
But the proponents of the bill need sixty votes to pass the initiative, so they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans.
The Democrats, who have a majority in support of the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the bill.
That's why the Dream Act's advocates need to get more Republicans on their side in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most popular Republicans are Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, and Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who took over from Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they stated they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken out in favor of the bill, John McCain, has yet to make his position known.
Although the House has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
Putting a finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust for Language' was a walk where participants strengthened themselves for the story
"I understand the language sex thing, but... the finger in the wound, what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was opening the second round of Los Placeres de la lengua, a cycle celebrating Spanish-language literature, using the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event, the roundtable was dedicated to language sex, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "bringing us into trouble", the Argentine writer spat sweetly to the audience, which was composed mainly of young people who had gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend the roundtable, moderated by Marisol Shultz, in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero took part.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Shultz later described as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist, who is looking to find out what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get an answer, but she gets clues for the guide of her story.
She leaves the infectious disease doctor convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound".
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the trauma specialist, who took her breath away in the middle of the hallway, but who explained to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist of the story sighs relieved and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it was really open and did not exist". But she is convinced that the pleasure in language and its traps are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story, which he called "The Praise of Invention", in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back men who had traveled far, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story took a turn and reported on America, the great novel that from the beginning did not lack its own chronicler, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all, mocked the shamed witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with imagination that even the sense of shame was missing".
However, he points out that "it is the madmen and liars who imagine things best", and that is where reality and lie come closer together, where you can't tell which side the story belongs to, where fiction reaches its peak.
He actually calls it the Cervantes tradition.
"From him we inherited the story of being".
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations which had been contributed to by the invitation of the FIL to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound'.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican women dedicated their contributions to the great wound of social violence that is afflicting their country - as well as all of Latin America - as a result of the fight against drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not deliberately planned commitment", she explained, after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "that finger of the committed writer in the writer's wound".
He observed that in a fast-paced world, even intellectual habits and control of the mind are dogmatic, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every denial a little yes".
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuancing often means putting our finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable thinking in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuance, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white", he observed, inviting us to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano is fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he's had ups and downs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
The final match between Santos Laguna and Monterrey also pits two different styles, defined by their respective coaches, and their contrasting encounters are reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has behaved well, which is why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentine has won the second medal, he is one step behind the winners and, amazingly, he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santista strategist reached the first final as coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he suffered a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003', he achieved the decisive duel, which he also lost 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna in the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take a hit back as the game ended in a 2-2 draw against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the eleventh meter, he came forward with 3-1 and got two chances to take his title, but ultimately three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be pursued by misfortune again and free himself from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break statistics, this is for a club, for my affection, to which I am committed, and that is why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important", commented the pilot when asked about the lost finals.
He still remembers the final, and he says he learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee whistles the end, we can't celebrate, we're on the line, the players are ready, because last time we were two-tenths of a second ready to go out, and I think that's a lesson, until the game is over, there's no reason to celebrate".
Knowing that this series could be decided by 11th-metre shots does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at 11th-metre shots, you want to finish in the regular time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tournament we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense effort to keep the title in our hands, which left us something for this final, and we hope that this time it will not happen".
It's in Romanso's power to not just be second champion and to taste the glory that comes with the title for the first time.
The US changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The visa applicant must present himself or herself at the visa service before the consular interview, thus reducing the costs and waiting times.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa at the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants must introduce themselves at the Visa Application Services (ASC) before their interview at the consulate.
The ASC staff shall record the applicant's biometric data, which shall be verified by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately for the appointment, processing of the visa application and the transport service that handles the document.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for an application visa (including temporary workers' visas) and $390 for handlers and investors.
Those who wish to extend their visas do not have to go to the consulate to interview them, but simply present themselves at the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data is collected at the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the interview at the consulate will spend less time there than before.
Those applying for the visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the $26 service charge.

The North American Space Agency has called a press conference to announce a discovery tomorrow that will have implications for the search for life in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C. by experts in astrobiology, a science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe.
At the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a sensational discovery for the search for extraterrestrial life", prompting speculation among experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments previously thought uninhabitable, human-like creatures could exist. It was hypothesized that they could transform into intelligent living beings - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for all life on Earth because of the lake's high arsenic content.
Somehow, the microbial community uses arsenic as a survival resource, and given this ability, the chances are that there could be similar life on other planets that don't have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, the astrobiologists say, "it is proven that there is actually another life form, a second life form, different from the one we know".
The Space Agency will announce the actual scope of its fund at a press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference is attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is investigating the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon) to see if its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
The reform of the Organic Act on Congress will introduce the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th parliamentary term had just begun, and an opposition bloc had already been installed, led by the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent, and the four questioned the introduction of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Before the start of the inaugural session of the 60th parliament, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the Organic Law, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, for now there would be two persons, the same number as parties, controlling Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Bureau, headed by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties had introduced their political marginal position institutionally with these reforms.
He explained that they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI in the next few days to change the scheme, assuming that they had the political will and if they did not have it, they would be subjugated by both parties again, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"This is where I come in (the opposition coalition), this is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, who do not even consider the opinion of others".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the bill to have a permanent two-party system in Congress".
"This group starts with five members and they talk to other members to get more members", the Convergencia member explained.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, referring to PAN and PRI, said that the Congress has now become a 'booty for two'.
"Before it was just one party, now they split it in two".
Patrón Montalvo asked that the Members be respected and given their place at the negotiating tables.
"We cannot leave out five, who will probably be nine, because of top decisions. The five, who are currently seen as being split into different political groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table because because of the reform that was carried out and agreed by the others, we have been left out and we do not agree with this reform".
200 000 pesos more for the supplier
The Mazatlán City Council is paying another check to the controversial owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque for just over 200 000 pesos to Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This amounts to 1 200 000 pesos paid to the owner of the electrical equipment company in the second half of the year.
According to the City's Transparency page, this check, number 9258447, was issued on November 16 for the sum of Peso 200,144.56 and was intended to be used for "settlement of open accounts".
The treasurer, Luis Miguel López Moreno, had already predicted that more money would go to this supplier from the municipality, which is being watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at exorbitant prices.
What is not mentioned is the total amount still owed and, as a result, the number of checks still being issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debt being paid, just like the other suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two from 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last one from 16 November.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
After the Noroeste newspaper published on 25 July the examination of the checks issued by the municipality to its suppliers, it became known that already earlier, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos in 42 checks.
There were also transactions with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourism needs to be improved urgently
Tourism companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the crash of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, in which a foreign tourist fell, the tourism industry in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to areas in poor condition that give a bad image to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Merchants' Association, recalled that on various occasions calls were made to maintain the destination and to turn the poor conditions experienced by tourists into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the roads and sidewalks had had a negative effect, as tourists would wander around and see the mess, and turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day, and they don't care how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't be doing the construction work that slowly and unplanned".
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall had brought to the attention of the city the lack of prevention and maintenance work.
"The community has to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again. How should they do it? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of fixing everything afterwards", he explained.
"We are eager to have a clean city. Not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in a good condition".
"There are other places that look unfinished and unmaintained", he said, "such as el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán".
"Today, we need more than advertising to attract tourists, we need a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean and tourist attractions constantly on the rise", he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these types of incidents simply represent what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed".
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist sites of Mazatlán, because they were not being used properly and were creating a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that should be taken forward along with the city, making the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that would first need to be cleaned up and cleaned up to make them attractive for tourism and to be included in the inventory we are advertising for this destination.
IP demands results from Congress
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical substances and their derivatives is a step in the right direction.
The business community in Mazatlán is calling for a dignified parliament, free from collusion between parties and the government, because Sinaloa is in turmoil and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated, and it is composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 members of the PAN, three members of the Partido Nueva Alianza, two members of the PRD, one member of the PT, one member of Convergencia and one member of PVEM, making a total of 40 members of the People's Assembly.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE Entrepreneurs' Coordination Council, suggested that the new members should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the MPs will really exercise their right to act without collusion between the parties, because it is common for them to make agreements in which they represent their own interests, thus turning themselves into carnival parades of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups".
He spoke of their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We make sure they do a trustworthy job and are committed to society and its groups above all because it was the people of Sinaloa who put their trust in them in the last election".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives was to drive and work together for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"Most importantly, they will drive economic growth, provide investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation".
He also called on the Commission to take the necessary steps to ensure that the European Union's budgetary powers are fully utilized.
"I understand that it is the second-lowest-resource ministry, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agribusiness".
The tourism projects must be funded, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which was not reformed in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King Is Seen
Dolls, cars, bicycles, and other toys are the cravings of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
It will be difficult for the parents to fulfill these wishes on the next Tridentine Day, for the household consists of no more and no less than twelve persons and one goat.
Yet, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan, and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar, and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes it's hard because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with the gourmets to sell", said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the children's mother.
Adelaida, four years old, would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting a 'monster car' for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests one-year-old-size clothing.
" (José Alfredo) told me, 'I would love that monster,' but I told him, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive", Cayetana sadly recalled.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is a size 12, ten-year-old Isaías is a size 10, and eight-year-old Miguel is a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes, so a pair of size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you would like to help realize the dreams of the Coronado Valenzuela children, you can join the 'Holy King Wanted' campaign by donating a toy or cash to the Noroeste newspaper's reception hall.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network, 10 house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, which are believed to have been used primarily for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment used for production have been confiscated", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec police.
A total of 11 men and three women were arrested, two of whom are believed to be the main organizers of the drug ring.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared in front of the courthouse in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest.
They could be charged with, among other things, the production of cannabis, possession for sale, conspiracy and the commission of crimes.
These house searches were the result of a lengthy investigation which lasted over a year.
"The information we have received from the public has enabled us to make these arrests", Ruel said.
Around 70 police officers from the Estrien regional investigation unit of the Quebec Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department had participated in this police operation.
Clandestine immigration could be easily traced
The Conservative bill, which the government says is to tackle the problem of ships carrying illegal immigrants, is likely to be voted down after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter".
"I stand with a party that has put shackles on your feet", Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff told assembled lawmakers after the weekly caucus.
The Liberals argued that the bill, which would allow for the detention of anyone coming from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants for up to a year, violated the Canadian Constitution of Rights and Freedoms as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, leader of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it was aimed at the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government does", Duceppe said.
The criticism of the immigration issue by Olivia Chow, NDP, has turned a blind eye to critics who claim her party has not been firm enough against the illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democrats are in favour of taking action against the blind passengers, and that is what we are trying to do through another bill, C-35", said Chow.
We therefore do not support the Conservative bill because it blames the refugees and keeps children in detention for at least a year", said Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling the honourable Member that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal immigration, this criminal activity that affects Canada and treats the country like a pawn".
"They expect Canada to take tough action", said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any confidence vote on its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a Conservative told QMI that the government would call a vote so that any opposition MP could immediately explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible creation of a new, permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry into the matter.
The Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, claims that this idea is not new: Quebec consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue in January.
The Metropolis has had a standing anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Yet Wednesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at all at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
It was not without reason that Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and member of the Parti Québécois, described this announcement as a "rabbit with a magic hat" and "a solution that was perfectly crafted at the table".
Minister Dutil, for his part, had turned to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on the future unity in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it", he said.
"You are aware of this problem".
According to Réjean Parent, president of the CSQ, there is no substitute for conducting a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide", he explained.
"The only way to form an inquiry committee is to resign Jean Charest", explained Yves Boisvert, a lecturer in ethics and policy systems at the ENA (State School of Higher Education for Senior Administrative Staff).
The Commission is also proposing that the Council should adopt a decision on the application of the principle of subsidiarity.
"We should be able to extend the mandate of audit", he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give auditors the same powers as commissioners, which would also allow them to compel people to testify.
The creation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should take a decision on the application of the provisions of the Treaty.
This request comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague Rob Nicholson, Minister for Justice, was currently looking into certain developments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Spring 2001, which involved motorcycle police groups, 131 people were arrested, despite the fact that the criminal code had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa has enacted the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict control
Several river courses remain under strict surveillance due to the heavy rainfall that has been pouring in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, a landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses have been evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall of 40 to 70 milliliters of precipitation was poured over several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimetres of rainfall were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were the most affected.
In all, up to 100 millimeters of rain had fallen here.
The snowmelt, which has already accumulated in certain parts of the country, is added to this precipitation and there is a fear that several watercourses will cross the river.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec National Security Service issued a flood warning for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The flood controls will be carried out in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian Mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière, and will continue to be carried out.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a bridge was torn down because of heavy rain.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a precautionary measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and is closely monitoring the situation, said security adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec State Centre for High-High Water Warning issued warnings on Wednesday of high levels of water in several rivers, notably the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly corrected
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has been hit by a partial setback at the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) for his controversial comments about welfare and Haitians, as well as his offbeat radio speech.
The CCNR believes that although Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their views, certain statements have included "untrue information about social welfare and unjustifiably negative portrayals of Haitians, as well as such rude language that is not appropriate for daytime broadcasts".
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion of suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who had committed suicide violated the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first order was lodged following a complaint by the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The moderators should provide information that is sound rather than misleading.
On the subject of suicide, host Stéphane Dupont had expressed the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Supervisory Board had concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
'The majority of the Supervisory Board considers that the episodes in question of the 'Dupont le midi' programme would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner.'
He was therefore not held personally responsible.
The last point of contention was the statements made in connection with the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had a media-driven debate on this subject which had generated a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated that he had not donated to Haiti aid because it was not certain that the needy would actually receive the money.
The Board of Supervisors considers that these comments were not abusive in nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative portrayal of the Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension on this case".
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half", explained the presenter.
In all its decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the spread of rude language.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted 'beyond its obligations'.
The consequences for the broadcaster, which was, inter alia, to communicate its decisions only once during prime time within a three-day period, are minor.
King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, a Montreal native of Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who excels in "Sanda" (full contact kung fu), kickboxing and Thai boxing, is now climbing the tatami and boxing rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago", said Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek combat everywhere, since for those who dislike the ground combat as it is presented in mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare".
Recently, the security guard of his trade and employed by UPS gave bad news to his rival by winning two gold medals from the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Boxing Championships in Edinburgh, Scotland, from October 23 to 30.
"I won the kickboxing and Thai boxing categories", he explained.
"I'm currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China".
"The fighters from each category were invited, who had placed in the top four at the last World Championship".
"I got a bronze in Toronto in 2009".
"I became eighth in Vietnam in 2005".
"In 2007, I finished fifth in China, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto", he added.
"It is worth noting that I have made progress in every competition".
"At this rate, I'll be number one this time or next year!"
San Shou or Sanda is a Chinese sport where punches and kicks are allowed as well as floor throwing.
The duels are usually played on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most famous boxer to emerge from this type of martial art is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, who is well-known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal were to keep a single event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here the "King of Sanda" Super Tournament, the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
"This is the most prestigious and prestigious competition in China", explained the sympathetic pound boy.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium".
"That was a great experience".
Zemmal won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro", he analyzed.
"There are four competitors in each category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)".
"The winners of the semi-finals will meet in the final of their respective categories".
"Then the winners of each category will battle each other to crown one champion, the King of Kung Fu".
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has awarded by mutual agreement to project planners $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has been awarded the most important share, namely that of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called Énergie gérance, was formed in 2004 as a follow-up to Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over responsibility for this important $5 billion hydroelectric project to the private sector.
In early 2005, the energy giant consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
The Parti Québécois considers that the use of consortia is a serious ethical problem, which risks distorting competition and raising prices.
"This is a new form of mapping and discourages competition".
"This means that instead of playing cards in secret, they are now playing games in open form", PQ MP Sylvain Simard told a press conference yesterday.
The question was raised by Simard in the National Assembly early in the morning, because he found it difficult to understand how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister for Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, had responded to this in the afternoon by vehemently denying that the contract was a game of cards.
"I remain true to my line", she said, reassuring the PQ that it had acted "dishonestly" and "lacked toughness".
She said it's the least the PQ should do is apologize.
The consortium model is a worldwide practice.
It is usually a temporary alliance which allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is underway and is expected to be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without competition having been possible; negotiations had already taken place.
Moreover, the consortium model in Quebec is no longer an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper Le Devoir noted last week, the consortium's model used in the field of civil engineering and consultancy is the subject of governmental investigations.
A brief survey of the Quebec business register reveals more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of permanent duration.
In this way, Dessau, for example, works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and also Roche and Tecsult.
Every link, and there are dozens of them, leads back to the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
As regards the Energy Gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that 'the Baie James area is subject to a particular labour force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been taking this fact into account in a particular way since the 1970s'.
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement which has made the nose turn over the fact that the project management contract was agreed.
"If you bid and there are few applicants, your prices will skyrocket".
"So you have two choices: either you take the people in this market and you say to yourself, 'We're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price.'"
"The idea is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people", Laporte said.
This contract, awarded to the Energy Gerances consortium, is one of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by Hydro-Québec or by SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
The newspaper Le Devoir, after a review, listed more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts awarded to companies or their subsidiaries, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had won 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
The total amount of these loans is $449 783 344, including the contract with Énergie gérance for $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the 'Parti libéral du Québec'.
Minister Normandeau had suggested that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that 'financed' it, before clarifying that it was rather their managers.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The 'green' label is not trustworthy
Greener, but more skeptical.
The Québec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but neither does he have confidence in the brands or eco-labels that are supposed to guide his choice.
It is a pity, though, that it is bathing in a media-driven universe, where it is so overflowing with information in favour of more responsible consumption: the responsible consumption barometer laments a lack of credible information, an inadequacy which is a brake on its commitment, as the first reading held yesterday showed.
Although they boosted consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers seem to be paying little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of the Quebec population admit that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as much as they do in the green advertising of companies, according to the measuring instrument developed by the responsible consumer centre at the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding is that half of consumers question the credibility of official certificates attached to supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of the Quebec population take the political discourse on this subject seriously.
Nevertheless, information on responsible consumption seems important for stimulating this segment of consumption, which is currently enjoyed by only about one third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are suspicious of the reported efficiency of the green products and services that are being offered.
According to another communication, in 2010 over half of consumers had already changed their habits, mainly by changing the brand of one or more products, in order to express their beliefs.
According to the Barometer, 61% of them also preferred to buy from local retailers and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the eco-consumer index had reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its environmental footprint by taking care of the animals.
But social and environmental awareness seems to be ahead of the car, the barometer shows: only 28% of Quebeckers said they used public transport or preferred the public transportation system in 2010 to demonstrate their environmental interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the respondents in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds the stereotypes.
State bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to contribute financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The development company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the eXcentris cinema complex owned by Daniel Langlois on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to return it to its original cinematic function, are apparently not getting what they asked for.
The government has agreed to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a loan of less than the amount initially hoped for, which could create a viable solution on favorable terms, at least according to the sources available from the government's rumor booths.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and the request has since been again reduced in total.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is in charge of the eXcentris file.
Several days ago he had sent her a final report.
The Cabinet's counterproposal was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to reply to this.
At any rate, the premise of state aid seems to have been really pushed aside.
It should be recalled that the Quebec association of cinema and cinema complex owners had opposed direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance to provide for real estate projects there, which he had not also provided to other cinemas.
However, several other operators in the segment complained about substantial economic aid.
After the cinema had been built with his own money, the director of the cinema, Daniel Langlois, had for over ten years, with great difficulty, presented the author's cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exceptional arrangement on the part of the State Treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clients on the hook.
The Angus Society and the Parallèle company, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are also running a privately funded campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to stimulate the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The future acquirers intend to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the highly successful film by Xavier Beauvois, "Des hommes et des dieux".
The Commission has not yet taken a decision on the matter, but it is now in the process of examining the matter.
The mystery of the shaken Canada revealed
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians vis-à-vis Americans, but they also reveal the superiority of Canadians vis-à-vis Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voter did not have Canadian-American relations in mind during the election, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the Conservative government to pass its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American embassies in Ottawa and Washington, which were made public yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantive content to be chewed.
A link from 22 September 2008, i.e. during the height of the federal election campaign, reports on the point at which the UN is no longer involved in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
"A near-inherent inferiority complex may be causing Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of everyday life rather than to give the United States the black Peter in this election (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)", he says.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of".
The Ambassador is all the less aware of this "deafening silence" because the two countries have close political and economic relations.
"Logically", he says, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more so a party leader, to conduct such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the ballot".
Another expression of this sense of importance is found in the communication sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Her trip will help ensure the government's continued presence in the vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade, which was created by a $30 to $40 billion stimulus program", Breese explains.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the coalition from toppling parliament and the continued existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another message, dated January 2008, written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC are spreading from the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about programmes such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which contain few subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List", or even abductions for the purposes of muscle-popping CIA interrogations.
Another report details how Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to take in certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question in the affirmative, but on the basis of an individual 'case-by-case' decision.
At the end of the meeting, he "handed the Secretary of State a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin".
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the file".
Finally, let us note that the sentiments about the website WikiLeaks are heating up.
Tom Flanagan, an old friend and Stephen Harper's very close adviser, had told CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He had referred to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for the renewal of lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancun a plan to renew lighting in homes, businesses and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that is nearly one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the concrete large-scale projects which the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from the developed countries.
The main problem, in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs released into the earth by lighting, would be avoided, according to the plan presented yesterday, if the white-glowing bulbs, which have so far held a 50-70% monopoly on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or, better still, light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the world's fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we would have to subtract 5 Gt from this balance sheet to stabilize the rise by 2 degrees Celsius between now and 2020 to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-glowing bulbs, 95 percent of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5 percent produces light.
The compact bulbs reduce energy consumption by 75%, and the new LED bulbs reduce this energy consumption by a further twofold.
The average duration of the compact fluorescent bulbs is between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as the one that the manufacturer Philips launched this week -- that company, by the way, participated in the UN study -- have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-glowing bulb, which gives a hint of the savings of the replacement plan to be implemented in 100 countries.
Apart from the fact that these completely new bulbs give off very little heat, they can also operate with a regular resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have pointed out that compact fluorescent light bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless the producers provide a reception site.
However, the report says that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit significantly more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the benefits that each country would reap from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and 8 million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, which would cost Indonesia $2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay", a spokesman for the UN chief stressed.
'It asks all parties and institutions in Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the preliminary results.'
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the election commission had moved the deadline set for Wednesday at midnight to three days after the election on Sunday without publishing the results.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the CEI President had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls were made from all over the world for the CEI to finally announce the winner of the second round of elections under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects the Constitutional Council to annul "fraudulent" votes in the north, which were obtained by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivorian presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN's maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the polls.
The whole election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council takes into account the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's supporters now believe that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a political close ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any links to the former rebels, called the delay in announcing the election results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies reiterate that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and that it is illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Court after preventing the Electoral Commission from publishing the results.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held to crown the process of unification and reconciliation of a country that had been divided into two for years.
The United Nations warned Ivory Coast's politicians on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for any unrest.
Laurent Gbagbo won the first round of the elections on 31 October with 38% of the vote, against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolitan area (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the provisional seasonally adjusted figures published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office for the Inland Sea.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis stands at 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolitan area and 9.7% including the overseas departments.
The unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points over the year.
More broadly, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter but wanted to find work, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or whether they were looking for work.
The situation of young people on the labour market continued to deteriorate, with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+0.9 percentage points over three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% when the overseas regions are included.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The elderly, on the other hand, have recorded a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of those over 50 years of age, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only those aged 25 to 49 benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolitan area (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a dispute over its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, continues this method, and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
An investigation was launched against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the president of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône (PS) region, and he was sent to prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public markets and suspected fraud.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement of company assets, embezzlement of public property, peddling, complicity in corruption, illegal bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on any questions the prosecution will ask him, instead of spreading brainwashing".
"It's easy to make him a series of criminal charges, but it's another thing to prove them", his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before his client's hearing.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had made it his business to send the judge a memorandum of justification before his hearing through his lawyers.
A Guérini resident, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill running, which he was supposed to run.
He never knew the scope of the business or the destination of the funds involved, Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne conurbation, was also charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but was then released on the condition that he stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts alleged against him".
"The chief prosecutor has taken care not to deprive him of his liberty", said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released from detention on Tuesday night, including two under judicial supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the waste management company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "illegal influence and passive bribery".
Two civil servants from the Aubagne conurbation, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the grounds of 'intervention and embezzlement of public property by a public servant' and the other on the grounds of 'accomplice in embezzlement of public funds'.
Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with "fraud and embezzlement of company assets".
Among the persons confronted with Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in connection with a similar case of public fraud involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company of helping to launder money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste disposal sector, is being conducted in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigative procedures.
According to sources close to the investigation, the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the tender and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also contains waste from the Aubagne area and from certain towns in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
The Clotilde Reiss affair: the Elysée Palace is overdoing its role as a mediator for Syria
Over a period of six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", stunned the French public, put the diplomatic establishment on alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful eyes of the United States diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and seen by the newspaper Le Monde reveal some of the background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "hostage taking" in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman would not be in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held in France and wanted by American justice for trading materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they highlight the way in which the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media in order to make them believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he had done nothing about it.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way hostage-taking is handled".
François Richier, Elysée's strategic adviser, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, and American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They are advising the Americans to do everything possible to return their own nationals who are being forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise", they said, "articulate loudly and clearly and without ceasing" the words "human rights", "innocent", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do it".
Because "silence solves nothing", bypassing the attempts to discuss in a subtle way, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "regular Iranian tactic": "Hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announced that Clotilde Reiss' release from prison (which was to take place on August 16, the day she fled to the French embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (€230,000 bail).
And he says the Elysée anticipates more hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will intensify".
The Iranians could "arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French nationals living in Iran in the near future", he said.
28 August 2009
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago but remains detained in Iran.
Information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding from Iran for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, has been released from prison by a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is bad news for Washington, which is pursuing Iran's illegal networks for the acquisition of material intended for its nuclear programme.
Did France buy a cow trade ?
The Iranian 's liberation against the French 's ?
In a further interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision" but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (now Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision", he explains.
Mr Richier also wishes to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under 'strict' supervision by the French intelligence services.
The Elysée consultant dials a phone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings run by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée has not spared its efforts to create the impression, through propaganda and media "escape attempts", that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad is playing an "important" and "influential intermediary role".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is the basis for so much "thank you" to Mr Assad, the Paris embassy asks.
"Despite their laudable statements, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done".
The document then deals with the reasons why the Elysée fell into disrepute.
The intensive communication effort "is aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria", he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008 which was then "perceived by many critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
'Building the Syrian role' is Paris's attempt to 'show Syria what it can gain by playing a constructive role in the region'.
It is also aimed at "seeding discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows this from a reliable source.
On 11 August, François Richier told her: 'Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything.'
"But we thanked them anyway".
"This should at least confuse the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is receiving them at the Élysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our compatriots".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government is to pass a law called "the Ashbread" that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have indicated.
A draft law to require online game operators to deny access to games to minors under 16 after midnight will be submitted to parliament in December, said representatives of the culture and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also in leading a normal life during the day".
"We believe this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep", said Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the draft law for Agence France Presse.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturers would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also considering asking manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games for those teens whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also make available to those who wish to do so free software that will limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report various incidents involving heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
FIFA World Cup 2018-2022: the host country is appointed
In a frenzy over suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday announced the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political choice that threatens to push the technical criteria into the background by lobbying and lobbying for influence.
One thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's royal discipline will be held in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be a bit more exotic, with the International Football Association hoping to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its 2010 premiere on the African continent, or to continue its presence in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities who are part of the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Ministers, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets the scale of the economic and political commitment to a World Cup.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult otherwise to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important to the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the forefront of the revelations by bringing about the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have just as well ruined the chances for its own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to host the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC had given it a second chance on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report which criticized three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
It is enough to anger FIFA and embarrass the English officials who have been lobbying heavily, primarily with David Cameron, over the last few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a re-run of the chess move by his predecessor Tony Blair, which won London the 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Would this intense effort be enough to re-evaluate England's image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spain-Portugal duo is not without its stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the British and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which has become a major outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport).
The European Parliament has also been asked to take a decision on the future of the European Union, and the European Council has also been asked to take a decision on the future of the European Union.
"They are being thrown in with dirt, they are being compromised", Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favourite.
First world economic power, home of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very nice project.
However, these new applications seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the 2002 competition.
Another threat is the FIFA's much-anticipated 2026 World Cup bid for China, which will put an end to Asian chances for 2022.
With Australia and Qatar having been all over the place with the prospect of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is expanding into new areas, but these two countries represent a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of the television rights acquired by the European countries (due to the time-shift), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: transparency
De Gaulle was really stunned.
Mitterand had made it look like he was stuttering.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed no hesitation whatsoever.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than that.
A warrant at the Elysée calls for the next one.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not a good sign for the side of mystery that is attached to the presidency.
So you have to pretend that the doubt exists from now on.
In one sense, and in another.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac's supporters claimed that a third term was not out of the question, without believing it themselves.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would be raising the prospect of a 'two-term' vote in front of the UMP parliamentarians at the Elysée on Tuesday evening had therefore spread a bit of fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy ?
It was a long shot.
The President merely reminded that the 2008 constitutional amendment limits the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election in a humorous tone at such meetings.
"You have seven and a half years left with me at worst, or at best", he told them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about the aftermath".
His words of the day before yesterday do not make him a candidate any more than the day before; but neither do they make him any less.
If they should provoke comments, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the presidency with the PS on one side.
It is not the recording of the competition with Ségolène Royal that is driving Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that has prompted many PS members to take up the fight more early than expected.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidate of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express poll).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion with the UMP about it", the Prime Minister's entourage reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If he thought defeat was possible, he would not be a candidate", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, who has accepted the openness.
Euro: ECB forced to keep buying government bonds
The last meeting of the ECB's central bank last year should provide an opportunity to show ways out of the crisis or at least to announce the introduction of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures, which are due to be finalised by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis has forced the Frankfurt central bank to be unable to afford to continue to inflict the current more than tense situation on the European bond markets in order not to cause it to worsen.
The political costs would be far too high.
The European Union is committed to the development of a European economy, which is based on the principle of subsidiarity.
She did not dare to say whether she thought the central bank could do more, for example by boosting its programme of purchases of government bonds.
'I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) '.
Mr Trichet, President of the ECB, had not been very eloquent about his plans the day before in Brussels, when he was heard by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, but had rather content himself with saying that the programme of purchases of government bonds on the secondary market would be 'continued' and that we would 'see what happens' at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB doubled its Treasury bond purchases last week to about EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some dealers, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government bonds yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
The expectation of a further increase in the purchase price is certainly not in doubt among traders (see page 29).
The economists are no longer expecting a remarkable change in the exchange rate.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's stockpile, the ECB will still be able to make use of the unlimited reserves of funds in a free-float manner over a period of one week to three months.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the future.
"I cannot imagine the ECB changing its programme in any significant way".
"Otherwise it would risk provoking new tensions in the short term", says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"I think a progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 is more likely", said Norbert Bräms, the Sal's chief economist.
I'm going to open the door.
In the area of its intervention in the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of bond purchases as to stimulate the sluggish market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the euro area sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
'It must at all costs take on the market's lack of investors and act in such a way as to prevent premature excitement about the returns paid to the weakest countries,' testified yesterday a major bondholder.
Because if interest rates start to soar, it will be even more difficult for countries to reduce their debt or even stabilize it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
The Berlusconi government is taking cover in Italy
After a week that started off worrying for Italy, the situation eased somewhat yesterday with the fall in the key interest rate to 10 years.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents had described the situation as "unfathomable" and had heard him expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which he immediately denied.
On Tuesday, however, the German interest rate had reached its record high of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts covering the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused some confusion in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out in his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, had expressed "grave concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
The Commission has not yet decided on the amount of aid to be granted to the Community.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italy is expected to grow by 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget currently before the Senate for consideration is estimated at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates that the budget deficit will be 4.3% of GDP next year (against the 3.9% forecast by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the riot over a new budgetary collective, which could be used after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken", says the auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are settled, as we have been saying for a long time", assures Arrigo Sadun, Italy's trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high level of debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011), is in less need of stabilization than other countries", observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, which could lead to early elections being held as early as the end of March.
The Commission is therefore not in a good position to take a decision on a major crisis.
Europeans are thinking about expanding crisis measures
I am sure that the Commission will be able to give us a clearer picture of the situation in the European Union, and I hope that the Commission will be able to give us a clearer picture of the situation in the European Union.
The European Central Bank has been the main source of revenue for the European Community.
However, there is no question of the beginning of normalisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt rating, which is probably the most effective target for speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which is particularly hard on the banking systems", say the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political time is passing much more slowly than that of the markets".
The European countries, well aware of both this gap and the danger it entails, are intensifying discussions on strengthening the anti-crisis measures already in place.
The informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, their G20 counterparts are progressing well.
And this is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan includes a number of unconventional measures to strengthen the backbone of the euro area countries at the crossroads of the markets (see below).
The European Union's Stability Fund, whose Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asian tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments in Europe in the wake of the crisis.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicitly fundraising, he is certainly preparing the ground for it.
The first publicity issues from the EU Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative told Reuters that the United States was supporting a possible increase in the funds mobilized by the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the leading countries, are also moving towards structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
The Commission has also proposed a number of reforms which are intended to complement the austerity measures but which will have an impact in the near future.
The Commission has not yet decided on the future of the Community.
Both sides are determined to avoid having to seek international assistance before they have drawn up their own budgetary corrective measures and decided on necessary structural reforms which will restore their confidence in the long run.
European investors are also discussing the options available to accelerate the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
Mr Weber, who was in Paris on 24 November, was the first to suggest that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to go back to its own pocket.
Barclays Capital, the leading player in the European sovereign debt market, considers that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, 'preferably' in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
The European financial stabilization mechanism, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion, is a real tool.
The Commission is not in a position to accept the amendments.
Especially when market conditions are peaking.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Orange alert
The snow events are still causing transport difficulties, particularly in the secondary transport networks of Brittany, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in the Orange alert level due to the threat of snow and ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in the Orange alert; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall is expected in the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, with light snowfall on the Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow cover is expected to be 2 to 5 cm, in some places 7 to 10 cm, and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snowfall is significant enough to cause traffic disruption and affect certain economic activities, forecasts Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy goods vehicles over 7,5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac roads.
The traffic situation on the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using one's own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER buses was cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic has been suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy goods traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "calls on motorists to exercise extreme caution on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Paris Roissy Airport and 10% of those from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfall.
DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in the Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been pouring in.
At least in the discussions.
The Commission is also aware of the fact that the Commission has not yet decided on the budget for the year 2000.
To kick-start the construction of the SGP, the State has announced a capital grant of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the amount which the SGP would then allow to lend on the markets a part of the financial sum at twice its value.
Today, finally, the first overheads have been made.
The supplementary budget for 2010, which was examined this morning by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of this money.
The measures are twofold: the introduction of a special tax on development and a higher tax on offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first, according to Article 15 of the draft law, is "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
The figure is: 'The proceeds of this tax amount to 117 million euros per year'.
The second is a reorganization of the existing corporate tax system: "to modernise it in order to increase the output resulting from it and to transfer this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring in?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not given in the text.
You're a long way from the 4 billion.
'It is stated that the tax resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of capital contribution raised by the State and gradually provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project', the explanatory memorandum states.
The SGP does not find this system offensive.
"From the moment you book the revenue (the two taxes), you can cover the projection for three years and then only draw from the 4 billion", it explains.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that in 2013 the 4 billion will start to be recorded for the 2014 budget.
This measure, for which the promised 4 billion is still a long way off, risks provoking a very lively parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Vengeful Hackers and Eager Spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a twofold significance.
On the one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal which is merely a scandal in the sinful hypocrisy that governs the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level and gives a glimpse of a future dominated by regression.
But let's take it one step at a time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an intelligence agency (any nation) is made up exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what you read in any newspaper for months (except the ones owned by Berlusconi), and the terrifyingly caricatured profile of Gaddafi has long been the material for cabaret artists to sketch.
The rule that the secret files should only consist of news already known is essential to the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a library devoted to esoteric publications, you will find that each work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what was already written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (nor because he did not know where news about the nonexistent would be found), but because those who practice occultism believe only what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown's success mechanism.
So are the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers as true what he acknowledges.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as the one that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was there such a fuss about the revelations of these files?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows: that embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then, heads of state and government have been able to call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have turned into spy centres, with the exception of a few minor representative functions.
Any viewer of detective films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that you pretend to ignore it.
But the fact that it is repeated in public violates the duty of hypocrisy and serves to cast American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that a random hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Moreover, the scandal is not so much a victim's problem as a "scouring" one.
But let's focus on the profound nature of what happened.
In the old days, in Orwell's time, you could pool all the power like a Big Brother, controlling every move of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have since proved to be perfectly true, where you could control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel you visited, the highway you chose, and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of the eye of power.
But when you consider what's happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can't escape the control of a hacker anymore, the control loop stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen to be the citizen's avenger - can discover the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets survive?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secrets, since it exposes the public sphere; but to reveal, WikiLeaks-style, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets is to deprive her of any power.
WikiLeaks did not wrong Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this insult to such a mighty power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer post any kind of confidential information online - that would be like a street-corner poster.
But it is also obvious that with the current technology, it is futile to hope that we can keep confidential reports over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state is traveling in an airplane and has contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private and exclusive relationships be maintained in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and novel, but I find myself forced to imagine the government agents, secretly and eagerly moving on uncontrollable march routes, carrying their messages nowhere but in mere memory, and furthermore, hiding the little written information they have received in their shoes.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically the Watergate espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology today is advancing like a cancer, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet is reconstructing a telegraph with wire.
The (analog) videocassettes had allowed film researchers to explore a film tape by tape by reeling back and forth and revealing all the secrets of the editing, whereas the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro proportions.
High-speed trains take three hours to get from Rome to Milan, while flights take three and a half hours, including the transfer.
It is not unusual, therefore, that politics and communication technology are linked to cars and horses.
One last observation. What is it?
In the past, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that are demanding confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is flattering its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the compliance with the rapidly resolved financing commitments (also called 'fast start' or early financing) that have been implemented by the developing countries.
And the gross French charms are exposed.
The Copenhagen Accord pledged developing countries to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU has been working hard to convince its partners of its commitment to fast-start financing: detailed progress reports from its Member States, press conferences, major side events, leaflets.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its very value: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries doing the same thing at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to deliver on its €7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But if you look at the details, things are a little more complicated.
This money was to be 'new and additional' under the Copenhagen Treaty, to ensure that an additional contribution was made without detriment to ODA.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark that he considers best.
The EU Commission, for example, has chosen the 2009 target: international financing will be maintained and 150 million will be added over three years under the Fast Start funding.
Other countries have adopted similar guidelines, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of official development aid.
In contrast, France considered that the financing of 'all new projects' in 2010 was 'new and additional'.
In other words, there are no indications for the previous year's expenditure or for the global level of official development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease) - France claims to be complying with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into grants and loans.
There is no rule for this, and everyone chooses their own calculation mode.
Some, such as France, consider 1 € lent to be equivalent to 1 € donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often emissions-related projects based on the most efficient technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro received as equivalent to a given euro... Moreover, only the cost of the loan to the donor country should be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind than the following consideration: it 'respects' its commitment of 420 million euros by borrowing 91.5% (€389.8 million) and giving away 8.5% (€36.1 million) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only EU country that makes large-scale loans.
Germany claims 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) are 100% committed to donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends 1 euro to meet its obligations, France spends only 10 cents and understands this as a comparable commitment.
That's some good talk.
In general, France's fast-start financing is based on a double fraud: on the one hand, the development of the action over time, and on the other, the reality of the financial commitment.
France succeeds in making it appear that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation by the Treasury (since it seems that Bercy was the one who carried out the arbitrage) could have a double negative effect: firstly, within the EU (why do the other Member States continue to donate when there is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early financing is only a small issue in a relatively short time compared to the whole of the climate discussions.
But it may be too much of a drop in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that doesn't happen.
In any case, it is imperative that we learn the lesson from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting method for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and of equitable compensation with the other countries of the European Union.
France could, above all, take the discussions on the subject of longterm financing forward (another crucial and currently debated topic): the question of the 'predictability' or the way in which its loans are booked cannot be avoided.
France could change its position to be as progressive on the issues at stake as it is on other matters.
The hope is therefore in the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement of France's fast start and its vision of 'predictability' and the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals a day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (formerly the Movement for the Protection of the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which states that its results "do not represent a statistically significant value, given the small number of samples analysed, but rather an illustrative character of the problem being addressed", had purchased the food normally consumed at four meals by a child of about ten years of age plus a snack at the supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day - were tested as well as lab-made sandwiches for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance is staggering: 81 chemicals, including 42 classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe, as well as 37 endocrine disrupting substances, according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical individual substance are not exceeded, this survey shows very well that the reality of the consumer being exposed to carcinogens or endocrine disrupting substances is a cause for concern", notes the association.
Already at breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three of the certain ones that have been shown to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The Brazilian apple, which was intended as a snack for the study, contained traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including the lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
Also, the meatballs, the tuna from the box, even the baguette and the gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
The analysis of the tap water revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected, and even the plastic dish used to microwave the meal was not untouched.
The final risk of this "polluting cocktail" to the consumer "is probably underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed, "in view of the urgency of the situation", a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
