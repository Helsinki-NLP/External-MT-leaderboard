The Prague Stock Exchange fell to negative as trading closed
After a sharp fall this morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions in ČEZ shares accounted for almost half of the ordinary daily trading volume.
The Prague Stock Exchange has followed its Monday slump by almost six percent since Tuesday's trading.
This time, the fall is caused by the stock market crash on Wall Street.
And so, here in the United States, we have a market reaction to the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to support a plan to stabilize the financial sector there.
The fall of Asian stocks
Shares in Asian markets fell dramatically on Tuesday, though indexes eventually wiped some of the losses off over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong fell almost 4 percent during the trading day, but later reversed some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney stock market was down more than 5 percent, but eventually the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market, according to the Taiwan stock market index, fell 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world", noted Hong Kong's chief currency officer Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, sets its monetary policy independently, i.e. without dependency on the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has called on US lawmakers to quickly return to negotiations and approve a proposal to boost the financial system.
Otherwise, he says, other countries may feel the effects.
The bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a financial bailout plan that was supposed to cost up to $700 billion.
The lawmakers ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks were in a bloodbath on Monday as major stock indexes fell their biggest in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index has fallen nearly 7 percent, the last time it fell to a similar extent was in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but once it became clear that the bill had failed in the House, the index found itself in free fall.
Congress backed down: the U.S. government can pump $700 billion into the banks
Top officials in the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader financial assistance agreement for the U.S. financial system.
The vote will be early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a $700 billion bailout of the U.S. financial system.
But it's not won yet.
Congress has to finalize some of the details of the agreement before they can publish the final bill and vote on it.
The financial system bailout plan will be discussed on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was reported to Reuters on Sunday by the chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee Barney Frank.
Sources say the Senate could vote on the plan as early as Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that a bailout plan will be approved should be the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, there will be a ' sobering up' afterwards, due to the complexity of the mechanisms to help markets achieve this in practice.
The plan must be effective.
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differences about what the market stabilization package should look like", Democratic Representative Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
She said the final vote could be held as early as Sunday.
Lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to finalize the government's fund.
It should buy back unsellable mortgage assets from financial firms, which drag financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a final agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we're there", Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis has had a major impact on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to get a final deal in Congress by Sunday.
They're trying to reassure investors that the Asian financial markets are the first in the time zone where the congressional decision could affect Monday's trading.
But it's not yet clear when the two chambers of Congress will vote on the bill, or whether they can hold a last-minute debate on a particular issue.
Lawmakers hope to pass it in the next few days.
The law will, however, still undergo a number of changes.
The total amount allocated to the aid scheme is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels the program is not doing its job, followed by another $100 billion and then the final $350 billion.
Bush praised the progress of the negotiations
The president can veto this decision, but Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds to buy back bad mortgage securities that had plummeted in value because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, remained intact.
"We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "both-party efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restrictions on golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said that the lawmakers agreed on responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, securing reliefs, timing funding for the plan.
The new law also limits the so-called golden parachutes for managers of participating companies and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
It should be run by the Treasury.
"We've worked very hard on this and we've made great progress toward an agreement that will work and be beneficial to the market and to all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for homeowners who have problems repaying their mortgages.
The government should negotiate new installments on the mortgages it buys to reduce the monthly payment costs for borrowers and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance chief economist David Mark, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"This is because it is not known by what mechanism and at what price the distressed assets will be bought back.
This will be decisive for how the losses of the financial sector and the government are shared", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not that important, according to Mark.
"It is far more important that this week, Congressmen agree to support this plan and to ratify it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement to be approved is the most important thing at the moment,' Marek stressed.
A knife-edge duel between MP3 players and cell phones.
We'll give you advice on how to choose
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
So it seems clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Still, there are plenty of reasons for a person to get a personal player.
The choice is entirely up to the use and demands of the future owner.
I'm guessing you can't afford a high-end, expensive turntable to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulence.
However, such music products do not appear on LP records and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
But if you have a shelf full of art rock, jazz, or blues vinyl, you probably dream of such a record player.
It's the same with music on the road, so music compressed, in a simple way, music in MP3.
Here again, there are price and quality categories.
It may be unacceptable for someone to spend $1,000 on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan would be unlikely to bite a $20 headset on the market.
Two extremes, with plenty of room for everyone in between.
There's a wide selection.
It also determines battery life.
Some of the best music players can do a lot more than just play music, but what most cell phones don't happen to do.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to its primary functions of calling and texting, it can play music and video, both recording, it has a better camera, a worse one, and maybe even navigation.
And if you take smartphones and communication devices into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, because no refrigerator can barbecue and no television can take pictures.
The versatility of the mobile phone has its drawbacks.
The more features you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy-consuming things.
Few cell phones can play music for more than 10 to 12 hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
So, for cheap phones, expect to play for no more than a few hours.
If you still need to call in, get a new charger to work just in case - even for more expensive devices.
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, even the worst ones can last at least nine hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem is when you upload music to your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be connected directly to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly onto a memory card, but few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in cell phones without reduction.
With the exception of the iPod, you don't need any special software.
Just charge the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players already create their own music library, sorted by artist name, album name, genre, or user rating.
Some devices only display a tree-like structure of directories similar to Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with an operating system).
Players are easier to use, cell phones are more capable
When choosing a particular device, pay particular attention to battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, comfort of operation.
If you're primarily a music fan and you listen to music for a short time every day, like on a streetcar, you can use any phone that plays MP3s.
Which is something that almost any cell phone can do.
You don't even have to watch the music formats your phone or your music player can play.
MP3s can handle everything, and the vast majority of music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and besides it, the vast majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better cell phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
You can simply visit the relevant website of the mobile internet operator (or other provider) and purchase the song or album.
This service alone could be a compelling argument for the purchase of a music mobile phone.
Unfortunately, the offerings of the operators are meager and mostly limited to fast-paced radio hits.
The prices aren't the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this is the way music is sold (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) that will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their cell phones with them all the time.
Whenever you get the urge to listen to something, you pick up your cell phone in your pocket while your MP3 player lies at home.
But it also depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wireless hands-free.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost every cell phone has, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music phones is the cost to many.
The cheapest ones usually cost under three grand.
For three and four thousand crowns you can already buy a very decent walkman.
But most of the time, you'll be limited by the absence of an output on the regular headphones.
The best and most technically advanced phones, even with a 3.5mm hole in the middle of a regular headset, cost up to $15,000.
One advantage of the players is that they are easy to use.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players are really easy to use.
The minimum of function, the similarity of control with a previously ordinary cassette player or perhaps a phonograph is obvious.
There's no collision risk in the form of a mistakenly switched on mobile Internet and a massive data bill.
Which device to touch
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2 type, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the corresponding card, you will be able to enter two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported for basic models.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8GB of memory.
If you already have a cell phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach out to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Irriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't have to spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are a more demanding listener, you may want to use specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate MP3 controls and thus the user experience is similar to a separate MP3 player.
The next is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman phones have the same user interface as MP3 players sold separately.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand dollars, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), MP3 players from the above-mentioned brands will be provided.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe I did .
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
Still, we're missing something here-- a virtual operator to make the classics go down.
He might not be gone long.
We have written many times on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
Moreover, this was confirmed by the CNU, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher here than in the rest of the Union.
The latest steps taken by the European Commission to regulate roaming charges may lead to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that's really willing to go into battle.
This may seem paradoxical, but we have three cell networks and a penetration rate of well over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to play on the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák has often pointed this out, having said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a traditional operator with its own network seems to have little chance (after all, it would probably be difficult to find frequencies).
But there's another option - a virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market led to a significant price reduction, which was then also met by traditional operators.
And before the arrival of hamsters like Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile, there were voices in the UK that were similar to ours.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
Besides, we don't have to go far to find examples.
In February of this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the operator has managed to attract more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which owns U:fona in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate efficiently, they need far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the measure is compatible with the internal market.
In this world, virtual operators usually profile themselves as low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS, but this is often offset by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheaply as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on a raw target group can be a pretty good move.
This operator is specifically targeting men.
"The right guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and trust", says David Seibertz, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates the virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a similar concept to Poland could catch on here.
The Commission notes that the Czech Republic has not yet adopted a decision on the compatibility of the measure with the internal market.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated in terms of the range of services it offers.'
No chance in the Czech Republic, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about expanding this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic are not looking too promising.
It is more likely that Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region", Jana Studničková, a spokeswoman for Penta's financial group, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measure is imputable to the State.
Rather, they are trying to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor emerges.
GTS Novera has long been interested in launching a virtual mobile operator, and thus wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
'We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them we have already managed to negotiate with", says Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
So maybe he's looking forward to better times.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be here, perhaps by the end of the year.
But for now, his rise is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
'At the moment we do not believe that there is room for a full-fledged virtual operator on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no entity has approached us with a comprehensive and serious project in this area", said Vlastimil Sršeň from Telefónica O2's press department in a statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemr agrees with O2: 'We have not yet seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build.'
He adds: "It is unlikely that a virtual operator will appear on the T-Mobile network before the end of the year.
We would have to have a concrete agreement on the table at this point to think in this short term.'
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor principle.
Miroslav Čepický says: 'We are open to potential virtual operators, especially in terms of cost sharing and infrastructure.
That's what we consider the most beneficial from a customer perspective.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for high-speed mobile internet.'
Responsible authorities - one-handed with operators
The mobile operators' behaviour is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
Why, then, facilitate the entry of such a competitor?
The fact that operators can pull together when they want something is also shown by the tension around the creation of the U:phone.
Perhaps the biggest pressure on the CTU came at the time of the creation of U:phone by T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information on the ČTU website.
But now, it's U:fon that's the argument for not allowing a virtual operator.
Martina Kemr commented: 'The competitive environment in the mobile market has recently been further strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on it and in particular on its services.'
However, given this approach of mobile operators, the complete indifference of the Czech regulatory authorities is striking.
This is not just the position of the CTU, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the United Kingdom and other developed countries - does not have the power to interfere in competition.
These are exclusively the responsibility of the Office for the Protection of Competition (OCC).
But he took his typical stance on the whole issue.
'The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual operator for the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential bidders was probably not of sufficient interest to traditional operators', said Kristián Chalupa from the EEAS's External Relations Department in response to our question.
This statement from the operators' representatives is not surprising.
This is a big step forward for an agency that is supposed to represent consumers' interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position in the market.
In particular, as Kristián Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries where virtual operators are common, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower mobile phone prices".
However, it is clear that the pressure to correct the market environment and the decrease in prices is not in the interests of the GOC.
What's really shocking about the whole case is the touching consensus of the three cell phone operators that comes from their response.
The question of whether it is really a coincidence arises all by itself.
Like the exact same price of gasoline at gas stations, it is certainly a matter of chance and fierce competition.
'The Authority has found no evidence of anti-competitive conduct in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore no correspondingly increased responsibility for its market behaviour.
The telecoms regulator is also likely to lack the necessary tools to open up the mobile market to virtual operators,' Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position is one of the many points of dispute.
There is of course an analysis of the relevant markets by the CTU which shows that telecommunications is the only market from a competitive point of view.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the approval of the network operator is always required to establish a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has, quite logically, a monopoly on its network.
So in a certain segment, they have to be dominant.
Even if this argument were not accepted, the fact that the three mobile operators behave in a strikingly similar way should at least be a warning to the OHIM.
The complaints of a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when negotiating with all operators.
The shift of responsibility to the CTU is a fairly common trick in telecommunications, with which the CSA takes its hands off the whole matter.
We've met him on a few similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendments to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the CTU's competence to the area of competition in telecommunications had not been implemented, although many experts had promised that the situation would improve.
The U.S. Marshals must know better than that, but apparently their interests lie elsewhere.
It's all right when no one's looking.
The functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are quite a few in Czech mobile networks, is not noticed.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile phone services, but only partially public.
They're usually multi-level marketing companies.
It offers its own mobile phone services, such as Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the select few.
The magic is that the company acts as a classic corporate customer to the carrier who orders large quantities of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, he will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
'If the cases you mention were to occur, it could be a breach of the terms of the contract we were dealing with and could result in the termination of the cooperation with the company in question,' Martina Kemr answered our question on this issue.
However, it is unlikely that such action would not reach the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, the three companies mentioned above may have thousands of customers.
No operator is opposed to such a procedure.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established whether the measure in question constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
Miroslav Čepický points out the potential problems: "The law allows for such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name and cannot therefore be used in full as normal mobile phone customers.'
But that's what should be the least weird.
In addition, another question for the OHIM is raised.
If mobile operators are turning a blind eye to such a procedure, why are they blocking the emergence of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the OHIM has a fairly strong power to detect such activity and, if it does not wish to, it may not be satisfied with the operators' explanation that they have no knowledge of such activities and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As already mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant decrease in service prices.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators have emerged, traditional operators have tried to prevent them from emerging to a greater or lesser extent.
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - too small, too saturated market, quality of service problems, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at this point that regulators stepped in to protect the interests of their customers, not the interests of mobile operators.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they have succeeded in creating the first virtual operator and have followed up with others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case away like a hot potato.
In our experience, we cannot escape the impression that the lack of clarity in the competences is more than useful in these cases.
But let's not throw a flint in the reed.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and a virtual operator appears here really soon, the Czech mobile market may be rebounding.
If one operator has allowed the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the OTC will hardly be able to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we might stop calling the police as in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech national anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four renditions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech Statehood Day solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj.
The anthem was re-recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of George Whitehead.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, choral and instrumental versions.
The singing was performed by Katerina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz server.
The Whitehead considers the Czech national anthem one of the most beautiful hymns.
He told Czech Radio earlier that he had deliberately chosen singers with young representative voices who are distinctive and popular to sing solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them and the congregation had a clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they agreed", he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where is my home was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovsky Theatre in the original Czech play Fiddler by Josef Kajetan Tyla, accompanied by music by František Škrup.
It became popular and people spontaneously embraced it.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the formation of the independent Czech Republic.
What's the "new" anthem sound like?
Prague MHD will be bringing in a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will go down in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, tram and buses with an electronic ticket in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
It can buy about 100,000 people who own an OpenCard chip card right now.
Passengers can buy and have their 30-day, 90-day and annual vouchers (valid from 1 January 2009) uploaded to their chip cards at the Transport Enterprise's information centres and workplaces at the Museum, Bridge, Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
Coupons can be purchased online from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
Over 400 customers had used the service by this afternoon.
Those who start using online shopping can finally forget about the sales windows in subway stations, where they have had to regularly stand in long lines for paper tickets.
They buy a coupon online and have it uploaded to their Opencard card at one of the 13 City Library branches.
"At these places, passengers have a counter with trained staff to help them with their online shopping and to upload the voucher to their card", said Martin Opatrný, a spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to download electronic Opencard vouchers from the self-service machines installed in several metro halls.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, resembling ticket signs, and passengers may have noticed them at the underground stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the city, but by the end of the year there should be 80", added the Cautious One.
The coupon checks the driver's seat automatically
The machines, which will be operational tomorrow, are simple to operate.
You just insert an Opencard chip card into them and the prepaid coupon loads itself into them.
Electronic coupons will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding areas.
That is, on suburban trains and buses with the number 300 to 499, which are mainly used by residents of central Bohemian municipalities.
"On trains that are part of Prague's integrated transport system, the drivers are equipped with card readers to check the time and band validity of the tickets", explained ticket inspector Filip Drápal of Ropid, an organization that compiles Prague's public transport timetables.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the driver's locker.
The Opencard is therefore not only required to be shown to the driver when boarding, but also to be affixed to a designated spot on the side of the register.
This will allow the driver to check the validity of the downloaded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to check the validity of the downloaded coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information", he added.
Passengers who do not use the buses and do not remember when their voucher expires can go back to the vending machines where the vouchers are loaded onto their card.
Here, information about the validity of their documents is displayed on the instrument display.
Sudetenland wanted a referendum on the United States .
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked for the incorporation of the Schumacher Region into the United States.
It is clear from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States.
It was reported that in 1945 a group of Sudeten Germans appealed to the President of the United States for such a request.
This is shown, among other things, by a letter that was preserved in a private archive and is now in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from Czechoslovakia request in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Schumauer Dörfer" - seized by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and want to be sure that the American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", says the letter, signed "People who care about the fate of the Schumacher".
Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia supposedly gives the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national character - only hope for brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate over Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that, despite the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would grant this territory to some foreign state that oppresses and discourages minorities and has done nothing, nothing at all to help the Allies win", the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly fear of the vengeance of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States were supposed to question the minds of the Germans of Schumacher, all he had to do was hold a referendum in Schumacher County on whether its inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit naive in today's knowledge of postwar history, some historians believe it aptly reflects the expectations of Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans must have at least suspected that this would mean their expulsion from the republic, few of them even considered such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was a German builder assigned to the Baltic Navy during the war.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstynsk, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to learn Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would find Czech useful", said Chalupa.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be removed from the republic on the basis of Beneš's decrees.
You don't mean you'll pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive road safety event in Czech history.
Still, it's a characteristic of the emotional media campaign the Department of Transportation is planning to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleša Rybík promises to discourage drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will be on TV, radio, theaters, the Internet, and flyers.
It's supposed to discourage drivers from speeding and drinking behind the wheel.
And also remind them to fasten their seat belts before they leave.
It is aimed at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what's going to show up in the videos?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And that's what the campaign slogan "bloody" says:
You don't mean you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is in big letters on the spine.
And then in the pool of blood is the word "pay".
It's supposed to symbolize that a man can pay with his life for a moment of inattention.
The commercials will be "scare" the viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images of the victims of accidents are commonly seen.
He promises to reduce accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The commercials were produced by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whipping for the driver
"The driver is subject to a system of sugar and whips.
The candy for them is that if they run a red light, for example, they save time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk", says Martin Korán, a traffic psychologist at the hospital in Na Homolce.
That is why we need press campaigns and especially negative advertising, says a psychologist.
He says that the signs that warn drivers of danger are even less effective.
"If static warning signs are installed, they are likely to soon blend in and drive away", warns Korán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published Monday by the Jediot Akronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territory, if not all", Olmert told the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory) because without that there will be no peace", he added.
He admitted that the eventual restoration would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want to be run over by tractors or bulldozers, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem", Olmert said, referring to two July attacks in the city that killed several people and injured dozens.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites" that lie within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work", he added.
Leaving the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was an indispensable condition for a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing peace with Syria solely on the basis of withdrawal from the Golan", he warned.
"The Syrians know what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relationship with Iran; they will have to abandon their relationship with Hezbollah; they will have to abandon the ongoing support they provide to terrorism (Shiite movement) Hamas, Al-Qaeda (terrorist network) and jihad (holy war) in Iraq", the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: are bus stewards illegal?
The law doesn't know them, they can't ride the bus
In the wake of the tragic crash of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether flight attendants and passengers could travel on the bus while riding.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the steward's activity is contrary to the traffic law", says Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident that killed a 22-year-old flight attendant last week was apparently caused by a truck driver who crossed the road on a bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the least safe seat in the car at the time, although she has two other seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake violently even while the flight attendant is serving coffee or the newspaper.
The bus is equipped with parking spaces according to the licence.
If not approved on the bus, passengers must sit.
The Student Agency long-distance buses have no parking space; which Aktuálně.cz has also confirmed by the company's director Radim Jančura.
"We discussed this with the Ministry and at first they did not allow passengers to move.
They later reversed that and we came to the conclusion that passengers can use the toilet while driving if they have their seat", he said.
The steward knows no law
"There is no clear legal definition of the role of steward - no legislation deals with this role.
However, there is no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the term driver of the vehicle; it does not define his rights and obligations", adds Hanzelka's spokesman.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law deals with the issue sufficiently.
'It depends on whether the bus has parking spaces approved in the type approval.
That's the end of it", he says.
Buses are divided into urban buses with parking spaces and a speed limit, intercity buses with parking spaces with a higher speed limit and long distance buses without parking spaces with a maximum speed limit and seat belts.
It's like on a plane, says the expert
BESIP's traffic safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see the steward's movements on board the bus as a major problem.
"There are few dangers in smooth driving, as in a plane service.
"It's not even clear when turbulence will hit and the flight attendant could hit her head".
"But if the bus brakes violently, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or a streetcar.
The air traffic controller must deal with the safety of the flight attendants through internal regulations", he says, adding that the issue is not yet resolved from a legal point of view.
Yanchura is willing to cancel his service
Student Agency offers flight attendants as the only bus operator.
He employs 200 of them.
Even after the accident, the director doesn't consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward profession is risky, I will terminate it.
Coffee and newspapers are available for passengers upon boarding.
It would also save money", he says.
The absence of flight attendants in their cars was justified as a security concern by the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin, which operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
"We don't have flight attendants, we've been against it since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
A terrible tragedy has happened.
A young flight attendant from Pilsen, who had worked for the company for two years, died in a train accident.
The Slovenian truck probably veered out of the lane without using the direction indicator and blocked the bus's path.
His driver tried to avoid him with a sharp maneuver, but he hit him with the right front end.
The idea of two air hostess rest rooms being sold out is not acceptable to Janzura.
"These seats cannot be reserved for long distance connections, they are blocked".
The company's gonna sue the truck driver.
With the compensation to the girl's family, the agency won't wait for the court to decide, but it's also expecting financial compensation from the culprit.
Amend the law?
Out of sight
The amendment to the law, which has been in the works for over a year, could clarify the movements of flight attendants on the bus.
"But no concrete conclusion was reached.
Buses are not even much of a problem, but rather a points system, maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones while driving", says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of flight attendants to be something that would pose a serious threat to the safety of passengers", concludes Hanzelka, adding that police and occupational safety authorities are responsible for the safety of buses.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The letter from the board of WestLB to the bank's employees is full of big words.
The merger of the Deka-Bank and the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt will create the central institution of the savings bank group for trading on the capital markets, the letter said.
According to the letter, WestLB will enter into the transaction a 'competence pool' that will ensure long-term returns.
In general, such a merger could be a decisive impetus for further associations in the land bank sector.
These texts are produced when the board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, whose message to the Land government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, a link between Deka-Bank, which is known to customers of the savings bank for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been discussed for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
When presenting the half-yearly results at the end of August, Deka-Bank CEO Franz Waas suggested that he did not see the point of merging his bank house in Mainzer Landstraße with a Land bank such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is represented on one side by the Landesbank and on the other by the Savings Bank Association, has entrusted the Management Board with negotiating with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be capital market transactions or parts thereof.
But the talks have only just begun, the financiers say.
Deka-Bank, which is one of the most important employers on the Frankfurt financial market with its 3000 employees, is not mentioned for the first time in connection with the consolidation of the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that a merger could take place between Deka-Bank and Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
This trio was nothing.
Shortly after the merger plans became public, the Land of Hesse opposed the participation of Helaba.
The other two banking houses didn't join in either.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz has instead acquired the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, there has been repeated speculation about Deka-Bank's link with the land banks.
However, Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba Bank, recently expressed his negative opinion on the speculation about the merger of his financial house with others.
However, there seems to be a growing belief that the convergence of the various public sector banking houses is necessary.
Now, after the elections to the Landtag in Bavaria, the first thing to do is to draw up a merger between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure to merge increases, potential merger partners are gradually being lost.
In the south, she would only play second fiddle even though the financial crisis has so far been handled much better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was also banned earlier this year by the Hessen-Thüringen Savings and Loan Association, which owns 85% of Helaba.
Nord LB would be the most appropriate.
Geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, the question is how closely the business models of the various institutions are aligned.
In June Merl stated that the German savings and loans association had not yet answered the crucial question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of Landesbanks.
It could also result in the liquidation of WestLB, which is obviously not desirable in this institution.
The letter from the board of directors also states that it is seeking a "comprehensive solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how this will be connected to linking individual components to Deka-Bank, time will tell.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with Italy".
It's Elena's first time, Luc's third or fourth.
But this time, Elena's gonna be his girlfriend, and he says it's gonna be different.
Behind them, at the Kaiser's five-liter barrel, a more powerful bearded man demonstrates to 200 Oktoberfest tourists the depth of his throat.
Elena slaps Luca first and then she kisses him.
They've come to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus station next to the Puorta Nuova station, at 11:45 p.m. this evening, four buses will leave with the sign "Destination Monaco, festa della birra", expected to arrive at 6:30.
Three buses are mostly Italian, one bus is all Brazilian.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing their flag, already celebrating at night.
And this loud, says Marco Guarda, is not for Italy.
Marco, wearing a long coat with a faux fur coat and glasses with wide silver bands, owns the three buses.
He's been going to Oktoberfest with them for five years, and he's done three trips this year alone.
At night there, during the day between the beer stands, 10:30 a.m. return.
Marco says that overnight stays would be a waste of money.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast of Kaiser beer brewed strictly according to Bavarian beer purity laws, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco had been taking a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave at night, on the highway towards Brennero.
Beer's not coming, not yet.
The bus goes quiet quickly, the passengers are asleep.
They're doing well, they'll need their strength.
It makes stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where it makes another stop on the motorway number 8 just outside Munich, along with many other buses with Italian license plates.
When Marc's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 7:30 a.m., as scheduled, about 50 other buses from all over Europe are already parked there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco makes his final speech, explains the plan of attack.
One, put on the yellow hat.
It has the German word "Oktoberfest" written on the left, next to the Internet address of the March tourist office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the beer tent door opens, run!" Marco calls out into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and take your seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, so as not to disturb, and not all the yellow hats on the same bench, spread out in the space!"
The vase costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that we're being polite.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third: "Be back here tonight at exactly half past eleven!"
And up to Wiesn, the beer tent area.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs yellow hats as badges on trees, signs, and even on a campaign poster for a major Bavarian party.
We must prepare to retreat.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with Italy".
Exact figures are not available; it is said that 50,000 people set off across the Alps and crashed into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors arriving this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police force will be reinforced by seven officers from South Tyrol, and Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps national statistics, with Italians ahead of the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical treatments.
The Hofbrau tent is especially popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for the lender Hypo Real Estate
Just last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this politician used the word "relatively" and included in his statement the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared the crisis developments.
Because it happened last weekend.
The Dax index-linked finance house specializing in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a multi-billion-euro loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan aid would be up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will only have to pay interest on the amount actually used up.
The money is said to have come from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of Depfa's subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, this state financier has refinanced the long-term projects for which he lent money in the extremely short term, which is no longer possible because of distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves decreased by 95% to EUR 2,37 million and its equity ratio decreased slightly from 1,6% to 1,45%.
Current and net income from financial transactions decreased to zero year-on-year, while income from the appreciation of receivables and certain securities and from the cancellation of provisions for credit transactions decreased by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from compensation for the subsequent settlement costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from tax interest compensation and business intermediation for group companies was the 16% decrease on the revenue side still moderate.
The former state financier, after its privatisation in 1990, burned out on mortgages for businessmen, which were then removed from the service portfolio and continued to be managed by Aareal Bank.
As the traditional state financing was too low in return, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private investors and the state (PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to write down some of the value of its subsidiary and these write-downs will have a 'substantial material effect' on the profit and loss calculation of the whole group, as some have been vague.
The fact is, there's no dividend.
It was already reduced by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since the takeover of Depfa.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank lending practically dried up because banks are holding onto liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds annually for a part of Depfa's loan portfolio - around EUR 50 billion.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the group's financial need is covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is protected 'from the influence of the international money markets which are currently largely inefficient'.
Other sources have suggested that the money is used to secure refinancing until the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE's Chairman of the Board Georg Funke stated that Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the BaFin consider that the Hypo Real Estate Group's competitiveness on the market is now secured.
That's what the bank's shareholders and creditors hope.
But given the dynamics and the unpredictability of the crisis, there's probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan might not need to be fully used up.
However, the reverse cannot be excluded.
After the bank appeared to be on the brink of insolvency late Sunday afternoon, even a preliminary bailout will not appease the passions.
The stock price has fallen by 75% to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond prices held well.
While preference bonds have remained virtually unchanged, the secondary bond prices have fallen more sharply.
This concerns in particular bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, logically, bonds with a maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds initially appeared as an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability has to be understood in relation to the stability of the international financial system after the sharp exacerbation of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself, which brought it into the company by acquiring Depfa.
As long as issuing banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, repayment of the securities at maturity can be expected.
But it can also do what few people dare to hope for today - overcome the financial crisis within the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalization, the likelihood of a near certainty has now become a mere legitimate hope.
This is likely to set up a number of sleepless nights for long-term creditors in particular when deciding whether to waive their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the threshold line at least to create a carry-over of losses from previous financial years to exchange rate returns from later years for the purpose of future capital gains tax payments.
Sylvana and the secret of the bento box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop introduces herself on her first day at high school in Tachibana, the girls start to cry: "That German is so kawaii!"
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows this word from manga, and she writes about Japan on her new exchange blog.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was so tired on the way to school.
I live in the suburbs of Tokyo, heading towards Kawasaki, and I'm 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way, but luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of schooling in Tachibana is not as strict as it was in my home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin meeting after eight o'clock, and twenty minutes before nine a brief session with the teacher, called the home room, begins.
But before class started, I was supposed to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to speak in front of people, let alone a class of 40 students.
Since I had no school uniform, I put on my host mother's old skirt, a blouse, blue knee pads, and black leather shoes.
So I stood up in front of the bench and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayónara Wo se Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was so happy that I had started learning the language two years earlier.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering and giggling and waving and I kept hearing the word 'kawaii'.
I knew that from my manga.
It is a basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet.'
Then I quickly came into my seat.
The girl next to me smiled wide, considering it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the bell rang, I was literally overwhelmed.
They were talking through each other and giggling and asking me questions about the possible and the impossible - and Japanese English is really hard to understand.
Then, at halftime, everyone unpacked their things.
My host mom made me a box of these for lunch, too - and it's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice and herbs, small stews, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and some fish in tofu dough.
I don't know what I'm eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
The truth is, everything is really good.
Well, except for the salt-laden plums, bro!
Benta in Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a homemade bento, in this case a particularly artistic one, hoping to get to know him better at a lunch break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
'Cause it just fascinates me.
After all, for years, my favorite manga book was the one I read.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started learning a little Japanese one day.
So it was clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly regarded here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technology and trends, on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen".
Rats have feelings too
When a rat or a cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean that they too are afraid?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals have feelings.
But how could we verify that they feel the same way when they behave the same way as we do?
The online magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions from prominent scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you believe to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness that I or anyone else has not been able to prove, if we can't prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But once we start to look at another species and open up to questions of perception or consciousness in general, we enter into a very incompatible terrain because the hardware doesn't match.
When in danger, the rat will do what many other animals do: it will pretend to be dead, flee, or attack.
Humans behave similarly, which some scientists have concluded is a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to animal experience.
This is partly because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always involve the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and executive or management functions).
This vast area is far more developed in humans than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that humans are even different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature may be the linguistic nature of man: Because so much of his perception is related to language, consciousness is often said to depend on it.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if consciousness didn't matter to language, it would certainly be affected by language, so animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably be different from most states of consciousness in our own.
That's why it's difficult to know what consciousness might look like in other animals.
When, as something intrinsic and subjective, it can't be measured or, because of the special hardware, analyzed from our own experience, we face major problems exploring it.
Most of my conclusions relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to study the processes in the animal mind regardless of their content, and that's exactly what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially in the case of visualization.
But this approach, which was pioneered by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on neural correlates of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: both can be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the nonfrontal cortex for visualization.
What does that mean for feelings?
I'm guessing it's because an emotional system like the fear system is activated in the brain that's aware of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is a mental state we find ourselves in when the activity of a defense system located in the brain (or its effects, such as bodily reactions) exploits working memory.
And from this angle, sensation is closely linked to those areas of the cortex that are characteristic of primates, and especially humans.
And in connection with the nature of language, there is a subtle gradation of perception, because we can use words and grammar to distinguish and categorize states to attribute to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the cortex and brainstem areas devoted to bodily sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much over the course of human evolution, it could easily share the feelings of many animal species.
I can't argue with that, but I think it's unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what seems to us to be fear in rats and humans is likely felt by both organisms in the same way: But how can it be verified, Pankseep says, that rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
The cockroach fleeing danger - does it feel fear?
In my view, mere similarity in behavior cannot prove similarity in experience.
True, the neural comparison takes us further: Rats and humans have similar brain strains, whereas cockroaches have no brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if we could prove that in humans, how would we want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't really know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I'm more interested in emotional behavior than in emotional perception in rats.
Anyway, in this case, we can expect to see improvements at the neural level if we measure the same thing in rats and humans.
Just as I don't study language and consciousness in a rat, I don't study feelings, because I don't know if they exist.
It may be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly throw myself against a wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasyunyk said that the preparations will soon be directed by the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to co-host the World Cup with Poland", Vasjunyk said.
"But for our country, it is not amnesty.
The work has only just begun, and there is much to be done in both countries".
In keeping to the timetable for building or remodeling stadiums, streets, hotels, and airports, both hosts falter.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible", said Grigory Surkis, chairman of the Ukrainian Union.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time".
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
The Polish Olympic Committee dismissed the Polish PZPN's leadership after numerous scandals and replaced it with an independent administrator, Robert Zawlok.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport, Mirosław Drzewiecki.
There is a "serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules", Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have written to UEFA President Michel Platini to assure him that this step will not affect the preparations for the 2012 World Cup".
Several teams in the Premier League were sentenced to relegation last season for manipulation, and the start of the league had to be moved quickly.
An outraged Dennis Quaid returns the blow
She wanted to do a commercial for a new movie, she talked about personal matters in an interview, and now she's having problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan spoke of her ex-husband Dennis Quaid as a marriage wrecker.
He's furious and he's hitting back.
A belated war is brewing between ex-husbands Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are fighting an ugly feud - in full view of the public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine, Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for her marriage's collapse last week: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful".
She said she didn't learn the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The inspiration for this mental stripping was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - a story about a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his portrayal of him as an unfaithful husband was stark: "It's crazy", the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News, "Meg is repeatedly chewing on and editing the history of our relationship".
Moreover, it is "deplorable" that the couple's 16-year-old son, Jack, is again "publicly reminded of the pain and radical changes that divorce brings to every child".
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently fathered twins.
He concludes his reflections on avoidance: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself blessed to have a wonderful family that is doing well".
Airline and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights were even 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and hotel accommodations have fallen again, according to a study by travel and financial services company American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and, after rising prices in the first quarter, found a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation has already become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities monitored increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year from April to June.
The trend was most pronounced in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
American Express attributes the trend to a weak dollar, which has caused "declining travel appetite among American tourists".
The fall in hotel prices also affected more the financial centres than the industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne and Stavanger.
In fact, hotel prices in this Norwegian city rose a European record by 26.3 percent.
The price of air tickets also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
The price of kerosene has made economy class passengers pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, with fuel-intensive long-haul flights even rising by 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices of tickets in Economy class decreased on average by 12,5% compared to the previous quarter, while the changes in knowledge were less pronounced in Business and First-Class.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
They rose 11.9 percent from January to March, falling 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study cited above, prices even fell by half on German domestic flights.
One reason for this price drop is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any information on the measures in question.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
The cancellation of unprofitable routes by airlines and the large number of airlines which declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 in Europe alone - are indicative of the tense situation.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1-0
With one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV is at the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still failing to put together a working XI.
By Kristoffer Klein - enlarge failed landing for representative Marko Marin.
This Gladbach player got into the game too late and failed with a balloon stuck in the bar.
His message was precise and persuasive.
He just knew he was right.
"We need another goal", hissed Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the Hamburg Arena booths.
There was little activity in the catacombs, and the halftime break was over and most people were back in their seats.
Rieger was a HSV physical therapist for nearly three decades and is more respected than many of the occasional actors.
And so his request was heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb to the match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Joll.
His order was probably the same: come with the second goal!
It didn't work out.
"It didn't look good today", Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wish it was more relaxed".
The Hamburgers are 1-0 (1:0) thanks to the head coach Mladen Petriće (11th) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbašan could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory", summed up Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV is celebrating 121 years of existence this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and a live updated scoreboard on the video wall that featured their team as the winner.
It's gonna be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it", said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects the mid-table score symbolizes the league's unpredictability rather than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with the late arrivals of new players - Brazil's Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern's acquired Jansen - is slowly recovering but is not yet able to shine.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling", Jol said emphatically.
After losing the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
Initial reports of the sinking of the bailout package caused the Dow Jones to drop as much as 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day loss in his history.
Dow gained some weight later.
At around 8.30 p.m., this world's most important stock market barometer showed a 5% drop to 10,579 units.
The technology stock Nasdaq was down more than seven percent at 1,548 points.
The worst off were the Dow at this point, American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America, which lost about 12 percent.
None of the titles could make it stronger.
Goldman Sachs shares have lost almost 10%.
A few days ago, this company was owned by a large investor named Warren Buffett.
The rescue plan is to make funds available for the purchase of so-called bad mortgage bonds.
However, the entire amount should not be paid at once but in stages.
In return, the State is to receive share options of financial companies which could be redeemed in the event of a favourable exchange rate development, thus reducing the burden on the State budget.
Europe 's stock prices are falling sharply
Billions of dollars in aid to banks in Europe and the US are not without its doubts.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is falling sharply and the Dax index is being pulled down.
The US Dow Jones index is losing despite a planned bailout of the financial market by the government.
Spectacular losses in Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have plunged the German stock index (DAX) into a deep negative.
The shares of the Munich real estate financier in question lost up to three quarters of their value, Commerzbank lost more than 20%, despite the rescue operation of the Federal Government and private banks.
Dax has slipped well below the psychologically important 6,000 mark and is down 3.7 percent to 5,839 points.
Stock markets all over the world went to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street began the trading day with significant losses.
Investors are concerned that the US government's $700 billion bailout may not be enough to revive financial markets.
The Dow has lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, in the first hour of trading, to 10,809.25.
The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the bailout plan, and the Senate could issue a ruling on October 1.
Other European stock markets followed suit, too: the FTSE index in London first weakened by 3.2 percent, while the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's leading Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90.
In India, the leading index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 per cent and ended trading at 12,595.75.
In the MDAX, Arcandor's shares have lost after the announcement of the capital increase.
The private bank Sal Oppenheim has signed 23 million new shares.
The business and tourism group also announced that it would not sell its stake in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during a so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying through space.
Due to the soon-to-freeze fuel lines, she is now in danger of dying of cold.
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon - the gravitational pull anomaly.
A gravity flyby is a maneuver by space probes to gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space body, such as the Earth.
This can save the probes a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physics trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
But what scientists have been saying for years about this case is surprising: Flying objects do not behave 100 percent as one would expect under the good old law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are accelerating or slowing unexpectedly.
So far, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.
He was christened by gravitational wave anomalies.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was right, and he is trying to explain the gravitational pull anomaly by using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have discovered in the universe.
"Dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth, could be responsible for this anomaly", he writes.
Space explorers have only known about dark matter for about a decade.
It evidently produces a gravitational force that can be observed to affect other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, which means that it neither emits nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, let alone visible light.
Scientists calculate that this dark matter makes up a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Egypt: Kidnapped tourists are free
After 10 days in captivity, the Italian foreign minister in Egypt says the tourists are free.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
They say six of the kidnappers were killed in a shootout before they were released.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
I hear the ransom negotiations are already underway.
Germans are repeatedly targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists lured to the Sahara seem to be free.
The Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabiya and the Italian media reported the same.
According to reports on Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health status", Frattini said.
According to Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and well.
All 19 participants in the desert expedition are apparently on their way to Cairo.
The background to the shootings before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the hostages.
"The problem is solved.
They agreed to the ransom", the worker was quoted as saying.
He said it was "just about taking the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot and killed six hijackers and captured two of them on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, which was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
El Masri El Jom newspaper, citing a German intermediary, said the release of the hostages was being delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostage after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of stepfather "led to suicide"
Years of abuse by a stepfather led a woman to kill herself, it was reported in court.
After pleading guilty to eight counts of sexual harassment, 57-year-old Michael Trerise of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that he regularly bound his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death", Trerise wrote in his confession.
It was also stated in court that Miss Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth on 1 April 2007, aged 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise bound and blindfolded her and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was revealed in court that Miss Randle, who had spent a significant part of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the specter of abuse, which was perpetrated on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that in 2006, friends of Ms. Randle, who was also a keen surfer and cyclist, said she was "emotionally dead" and that she "gave up on life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
She's presumed to have choked on a plastic bag.
Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended: "I tied her up and blindfolded her.
"I did not abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even more frightening is the fact that if she had not done so, the case probably would not have gone to trial at all".
"I would like to emphasize the effect that Stephanie's parents feel your crime has had on their daughter over the years", he added.
"Obviously, she would have been a promising, successful, happy young woman otherwise".
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top secret documents on a train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top secret documents on a train at Waterloo while he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were obtained by the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It's the least serious violation of the above-mentioned law and there's no indication of criminal intent.
The BBC's defence correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would come as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry and the Government Office", he said.
An employee who cannot be named is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, a clause that deals with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution has recommended that the Metropolitan Police prosecute the officer based on the highly sensitive nature of his work with the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained classified analysis of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an undisclosed location.
The cooperative depository faces the debt of B&B
British co-operative savings banks may have to settle more than £80 million in debt after the bailout of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients at Bradford and Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be repaid by all companies that take deposits from clients, including 59 cooperative deposits.
Adrian Coles, the general manager of the Cooperative Depositors Association (BSA), said it was "humiliating" that the depositors and their members had to pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be paid off by the rescue of the Bradford and Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest accruing in the meantime will be paid annually by all 700 financial firms that accept client deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan Fund confirmed to the BBC that all 59 cooperative deposits are included in this figure.
It's humiliating that these institutions that have been so prudent... now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions that have been far from so prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay in proportion to the deposits they held, and that the collateral should pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the debt will rise to £450 million in 2009.
That means the depositors will have to find £81 million to pay the interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, the CEO of the Co-operative Depositors' Association, told the BBC that he felt it was unfair.
"It is humiliating that institutions that were prudent during the boom in the housing market now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were far from so prudent".
According to the BSA, no backup has fallen since 1945 when they were first discovered.
"We will need to explore all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what options are available to protect co-operative depositors and their members from a bill that could be substantial", Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, there will be interest to be paid for the entire year, and that could be almost double that.
Since cooperative savings banks are joint stock companies without shareholders, this account will ultimately be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
The milk goes up five pence a litre.
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that starting Monday, they will increase the wholesale price of their milk by five pence a liter.
This is the second price hike this year, after a two-pence hike in February, and it comes after a survey by a consulting firm.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want the price increases to be reflected in consumer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had last changed in 2002.
Bail for former Bangladesh Prime Minister denied
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajid's request for bail, meaning she could face arrest if she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said that the court had refused to release her on bail over charges that she had extorted more than fifty million tacos ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges brought against her.
Khalid Zia, a longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the local army-controlled government first grant her full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was released on parole to undergo medical treatment abroad, it is unclear under the terms of her release whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she's now appealing the Supreme Court's order.
"The Supreme Court denied Sheikh Hasina's bail request on the grounds that she does not need bail as she is already under investigation abroad and released on bail", said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We appeal the Supreme Court's order".
Her lawyers claimed she needed bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
A senior official of the People's League said Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the military-controlled interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khalid Zia both deny all charges against them.
Fears about polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children were not vaccinated against polio in the recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban-linked violence.
The UN last week conducted vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says she was unable to reach children in the southern parts of Helmand and Kandahar for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said this happened despite Taliban promises not to attack or interfere with the work of thousands of vaccine workers.
BSkyB lost a court case against ITV
BSkyB lost a court case to review a Commission decision ordering it to reduce its stake in competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17,9% to 7,5%.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB's stake was dampening competition and giving the company a disproportionate influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a transaction which prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading announced that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV had raised doubts about ITV's independence and invited the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin Consortium chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its stake in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution - mainly because BSkyB had previously said that it was willing to relinquish its voting rights.
New investigation into the American lawyers affair
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the 2006 release of nine American lawyers.
The move came as a report on the affair by the Justice Department's chief inspector was criticizing government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Albert Gonzalez.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that the lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine stated in the report: "The serious allegations, including potential criminal activity, have not been fully investigated or explained".
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to compel witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice fired nine U.S. attorneys in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the lawyers were fired for poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the lawyers' dismissals were not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissals were politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican lawmakers and senators, while others refused to investigate voter fraud charges against Democrats.
American lawyers investigate and prosecute cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but they may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Ministry, Minister Alberto Gonzales, was fired upon for his dismissal and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The inspector general's report was highly critical of Gonzalez's role in the scandal, saying he bore "primary responsibility" for the firing, that he had "resigned" his command position and was "remarkably disengaged".
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be honored
Rock star Meat Loaf is getting one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will be attending a ceremony in London next weekend to claim his special gold award, said he was "honored" to receive the recognition.
The song, which runs for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year's nominees are Coldplay, who have come in as the shortlisted band in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said, "There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them".
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single, peaking at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell stayed on the charts for about nine years and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - had been suffering from health problems in recent years, including having surgery in 2003 for an irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later turned out he had a vocal cyste.
A dark street, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, highways, and other land routes, some famous, others merely useful.
But even many veteran cab drivers and longtime locals have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This little alley is in the East Village and it goes north from First Street -- without going to Second Street -- between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
At about 30 feet [10 m] wide and 130 feet [40 m] long, it resembles a dusty passageway rather than a traffic lane.
There's no street names on the signs.
It's virtually invisible in a regular atlas.
But he still has a fan base.
Avalon Bay, for example, a developer of newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
Extra Place wants to re-pave and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques that are to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were enchanted by the shortcut simply because it was one of the last remnants of the era before the block was ennobled.
But the city's Department of Conservation and Development, which owns the street, has no interest in keeping it.
At a meeting of the city's community land committee, representatives from the city and Avalon Bay outlined a plan for the developer to buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, district manager of Community 3, the committee prefers a street-level option, with the city in charge, and has requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city now owns very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession", she said.
"There could be proposals for repair and management, which Avalon could do, but we also want to ensure public access".
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced plans to re-pave a small street and set up seating, several of which would be used by a cafe, which the developer is expecting to lease.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this deserted alley and make it a beautiful place for the public", she said, adding that the sale was proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Department of Conservation, said the city did want to sell the street, noting that his office's job is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark on history.
Some people think the street got its name in 1802 when Philip Minthorne's large farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
Extra Place was the back door to CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, and the alley is perhaps best known as the backdrop for the cover photo of the Ramones' album Rocket to Russia.
"The place was amazing", says Ramones manager Danny Fields, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes".
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, however modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - a piece of the city that has been left almost unchanged and should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who blogs under the name Jeremiah's Disappearing New York (subtitled "Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Dying"), posted a portion of the Extra Place story from the Talk of the Town column that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark even in the daytime, bordered by razor-sharp iron warehouse doors and slammed windows, where a week's old newspaper is sliding through the bars".
With a few exceptions, the alleyway looked exactly the same one night.
The rat ran across a dead end near the door that once led to CBGB, now a high-end clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle next to a fresh batch of discarded newspapers.
A couple of passersby said he rarely thinks about Extra Place, but suggested he could use a little spring.
By contrast, Fields said he thought some people underestimated the impact of the alley in its current state.
"The best years of my life", he said, "were in dark, damp, and disgusting places".
The debate on bilingualism: immersing yourself in English
In this edition of Focus on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the attitude of candidates to bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a California academic and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of "Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools".
Effectively reaching the Hispanic electorate is a tricky business.
Barack Obama's education agenda just proves that.
The Obama campaign notes that "African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students", which is true.
To combat such performance gaps, the Obama education agenda specifically promotes, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are still learning English.
The question for Barack Obama, however, remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in East Los Angeles County.
The vast majority of the students at this school are Hispanic from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
And yet, in the 2008 state math tests, they got the top score of an incredible 100 percent of fourth graders.
Almost as amazingly, 93 percent of fourth graders scored high on the state's English and literature tests.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than the one Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of ability and no-excuse approach.
Furthermore, and Obama should note this, according to Linda Mikels, the head of Sixth Street, the school's approach to teaching English to newcomers is "totally immersive".
The immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me, "We had a huge success with one brand-new student from Mexico -- you'd walk into a classroom in 12 months and not know which one it was".
"It works", she declared, "it works for us".
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for what other schools with high percentages of Hispanic and English learners should look like?
The results the school achieves should be taken for granted, but the educational agenda of his own party (the National Education Association is a longtime advocate of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education cloud Obama's predictions of an answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue when he said that people should stop worrying about "English-only" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish", he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance gaps, he should be thinking about the educational models that work, rather than ridiculing and trivializing them.
Oil plunges as economic concerns flare
Oil prices plunged sharply on Monday amid concerns that even a U.S. bailout of financial markets might not revive the economy.
Oil futures prices fell as much as 7 percent in early morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange to $99.80 a barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than 20 dollars a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street and two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After hitting a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, again boosted by a wave of enormous financial market uncertainty.
Anxiety reignited investors on Monday, even after the House of Representatives announced that it had reached an agreement over the weekend on the largest bailout in history.
This report was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the ongoing decline, the government announced that Citigroup will acquire the banking arm of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said the frenzied weekend of trading that led to the bailout plan "are proving unable to revive market sentiment".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decrease.
"The outlook for global equity markets, interest rates and exchange rates are highly uncertain", Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the contagion.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread around the world and especially to China".
The bank's analysts have reduced their expectations for next year as oil consumption has fallen due to slower economic growth and have cut their 2009 petrol price forecast by about 20%.
The wild ride in the second quarter broke the team record.
After spending more time in the Jets' jersey than anyone else in the last eight seasons, defensive end Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then on Sunday, he watched the second quarter unfold as the Jets turned a scoreless game into a sleepy ride.
"I've never seen anything like it", Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played their agonizing game against a gloomy cloud overhead.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Coles to a 12-yard touchdown sprint, perfectly foreshadowing an afternoon in which their evolving partnership moved a mile forward.
Favre sent Coles to two more touchdowns in that quarter, including the one that knocked out the cornerback, and another 10 seconds before halftime.
"It was nothing extraordinary", Favre told Coles of all his mishaps.
"He's a hell of a player.
We communicated well, no matter what people thought".
As Favre and Coles threw, the defense attacked Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a pass and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith spotted another oversteer and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds into the game, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal to take a 34-0 lead.
That's the most the Jets have ever won in a quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "Second quarter, or third quarter?"
When told that both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than the third.
Many points have fallen in a short period of time".
The reckoned Gebreselassie has improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why he is considered by many to be the greatest distance runner of all time when he broke his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first man to run a 26.2-mile race in under two hours and four minutes.
By winning the pleasantly flat course in 2:03:59, he beat his previous time of 2:04:26 from last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
Gebreselassie, 35, set the 26th world record in a career that is truly incredibly long - he broke the world record or at least is the world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month Gebreselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon because he feared - perhaps too much in retrospect - that air pollution would aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - he won Sunday's Gebreselassie with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
With track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya moving to longer distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in a time of 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had a calf cramp two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break obviously stimulated him more than it delayed.
"I'm so happy", Gebreselassie said to reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little hesitant today, but everything was fine".
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for allegedly over-planning his races, generally avoiding world marathon top finishes, relying on drivers as if it were a race on a track, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly diminish Gebreselassie's tremendous running skills.
Maintained in pace by four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached the halfway mark in 1:02:04.
After the drivers passed out, Gebreselassie was constantly being overtaken by two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
Just three miles before the Gebreselassie finish, he took a last-ditch run to Kwambai, who then finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, finished the year with the seventh fastest time in history at 2:19:19.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliff of Great Britain.
The 36-year-old Mikitinenko surprisingly won the London Marathon last spring in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games because of what was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin, improving her personal best by almost five minutes in the third marathon she ever ran.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully, running a long lead on four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners and then overtaking them at about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askalefa Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The pride and obstacles of black life in a segregated city
Hidden among the sprawling theme parks of Greater Orlando, miles from all the glitter, noise and giganticness, lies a quiet city that is alive with the pride and the challenge of African-American life.
Eatonville, the first all-black city to be incorporated and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred browns, three hundred good swimmers, plenty of queue, two schools, and no jail".
It's a pilgrimage site now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Eatonville Festival of Dawn! to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The town she described remains out of the picture, even though she made it a tourist stopover by including it in a Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers Project during the Depression.
It is still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he does not know what he is missing".
Even today, in a year when black presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama is calling for an open discussion about race, many residents remain wary of the gaze of strangers.
"We're very careful about how our story is told", says Hortense Jones, 59, a native of the area and a member of the city's oldest parish.
"It has to be right".
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It's both a historical model of black upward mobility and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It's a literary center, but it's also a shadowy example of the Southern rural black culture -- sometimes despised, sometimes praised -- that came out of American slavery.
It's not surprising that the locals are both proud and protective.
And the concerns about the image of Eatonville really didn't start until Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced the world to her hometown through heartfelt books full of dialects such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
Five paragraphs of a Florida tour guide turned the town a short distance from Highway 17, which runs through the often-drifting downtown area of Florida, into a stage for black history and human drama.
With the big drum in life and literature in the air, Hurston introduced readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"On the left side of the road", she wrote, "is a white, brown, modern public school with well-kept courtyards and playgrounds, always looked after by Howard Miller, though he is not very good at reading or writing".
She also mentioned Dash's new widowed husband, writing that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits in a clock hotel".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to local government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
This was obviously not typical of Fodor's publishing.
It wasn't really a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora told it like it was", says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, a member of the Johnson Girls, whom Hurston immortalized by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it", she added.
Hurston is still remembered as a cypriot freak who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin recalls that most of her rushes into town were unannounced in a huge Chevy, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on its decent dress.
Most of the inhabitants were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were reluctant.
"The people of Dawn have always been happy to see", Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back porch overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or major public readings in Eatonville.
"I think they didn't understand her significance to the world or her legacy at all", said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography, Wrapped in Rainbows.
The change came in the 1980's.
Orange County officials wanted to run a five-lane freeway through the city instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-lane highway.
Orlando's erosion has already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, among other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle to interracialise brought hatred to the doorstep of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white guys, they came and threw oranges and stuff at people who were sitting on the side", Franklin said.
"We actually had a lady here who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration, calling its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "more offensive than glorifying to my race".
Residents now say that desegregation of schools, while positive in some areas, has diminished cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the youth.
"Black kids were used to hugging - I remember - you hug your teacher in the morning, you hug your teacher in the evening", said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted until teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
"You don't hug your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there's a cultural barrier", Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many other Neale Hurston Zoras - black writers, actors, and artists who, like her, rose above prejudice with reckless self-confidence and quotes like "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand that".
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, the highly praised biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway came onto bookstore shelves, re-classifying her as an American canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was rediscovering the lights of the ramp.
Hurston's former neighbors now saw her as a savior.
To show what can happen to their highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived for the inaugural event two years later, and many return to celebrate every January.
The state backed out of the highway proposal after a few years.
"The five streams of the highway have revived, you could say they have really set off, a real civic pride", Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the local church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to reevaluate their past.
Eatonville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes seem like a backwater in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, 90 percent are black.)
Strangers who come to Eatonville seeking the history and significance of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Most interviews require prior permission, and certain things - like the murals in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by white people and showing blacks in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a bold, confident teacher who loves red, still fear that their isolated community will be misunderstood.
And as the Hurston Festival grew, so did the local pride.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, troubled and all, but no better, no worse, and as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, has a heartfelt love of the community as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for local government or the police, which he says he could use some help with.
And even the younger ones, like the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they pass by, think, 'Hmm, this town is nothing compared to the others,'" said Alondra Kenon recently after church on a Sunday.
"But if you really stop and look at the history for a moment, it's a very nice town".
Here in New York , we all speak fluent financial
Nothing has changed at first glance.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newsstands and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in the glass beehive of offices above them, every day the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York have their worst "bad day at the office" since the 1929 crash.
The couriers are still rocking metal trolleys on the sidewalks and carrying muffin makers to the breakfast meeting.
The Spanish still move between the towers, carrying, like human mules, fifty ironed shirts hanging from the pendulums on their backs.
Office rats still waiting in line for their morning bagel at street food stands, and it's still impossible to get a yellow cab on a weekday between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m.
It didn't look like a crisis at all until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to open a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this assignment to coincide with a late afternoon siesta at my local JPMorgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people waiting in line.
Not in front of the cash register to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of the ledger where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy's mixed-use store and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason I did.
But unlike me, they've already taken their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Staten Island.
They took money from thrift banks, credit unions, and those types of savings banks that have branches in only one state and that claim to care for their customers like family.
In the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly gone bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, was trying to find a buyer.
The office and store workers who were standing in front of me, afraid of another collapse, were moving their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe haven and that does most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
Average New Yorkers have learned their financials in the last week.
Some woman at my local Chinese supermarket was on the phone and talking to Lehman Brothers, that failed bank, and her skinny CEO Dick Fuld with such familiarity as if she was gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed housekeeper of my tenant's, about 50, changed the subject of our usual conversation-- Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she said: "I have my savings in money market funds now.
I moved it. I'm not taking any chances".
Muslim graves desecrated after Austria's right-wing breakdown
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian right-wing Free Party and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party take part in a demonstration presented by the organization Cities Against Islamization in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that show mosques crossed by a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right parties made huge gains in the general election.
More than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun, near Linz, were badly damaged between Friday night and this morning, and police believe it was an organized act.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols on some of the graves, such as the Star of David, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to cover up the motives of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It's not clear if this incident was connected to the election in any way.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of the desecration, which comes as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan draws to a close.
Austria, meanwhile, is entering a cycle of soul searching after the right-wing swing in yesterday's general election.
The two far-right parties, which collectively won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Free Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, waged a fierce anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the Free Party, which won over 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against scarves and burqas, and even expressed his dislike of foods that were perceived to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are seeking to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the far right in the position of the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this change was mainly caused by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad
Gary Glitter, a glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the monitoring authorities that he was planning to travel through France to Spain.
Kent Police were granted this travel ban last Thursday after they handed over evidence to officials of Glitter's past convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford, Kent's lowest criminal court, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A Justice Service spokesman said: "On Thursday 25 September, Kent Police applied to Ashford Criminal Court for an order preventing Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not attend in person".
Glitter, 64, has informed authorities that he wishes to travel abroad, according to his sex offender registry.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also notify the police of their planned departure date a week in advance.
If he failed to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent Police have announced they will not be investigating individual cases of Glitter's possible travels around the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad.
From our perspective, it's easier to track someone who stays in the UK because we have extensive systems here that handle potential threats more effectively.
Protecting the citizens of Kent is a top priority for Kent Police and we are working diligently to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders to minimise any danger to the public".
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for molesting two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities refused to let him pass passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he be returned to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge, the lowest criminal court in west London, and at the same time, Scotland Yard successfully sought an injunction requiring him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously jailed in the UK for four months for possession of child pornography.
A Home Office source said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, is calm and happy that Glitter has been prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"To capture the true character, I photograph the master off-scene".
No heels, no calls or costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, detached from the focus of interpretation, will achieve the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On one side, an artist.
On the other, a human.
They're indiscriminate, if you leave privacy out, in those moments away from the audience -- where you can see a gesture of intimacy, the depth of a glance caught in a flash, or the passionate gesture of hands that are casual because they're not going to step on stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates the theatrical performance of "Flamenco-people" with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer assembles a unique iconography of flamenco from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which is part of the Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca (Flamenco Photography Month) programme, "reflects the ever-growing international importance of flamenco", says the author, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people, but when you look at the photographs, you find that they are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists who are able to bring passion, sadness, joy... to the stage and completely captivate the audience.
It's not necessary to take a picture on stage to capture the personality of these artists.
He carries his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco greats.
Fascinated by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer began a long journey of portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on the record camera in 1997.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
The use of different stylistic means contradicts the classical basis of the picture and gives it a contemporary spirit, an idea that Bauer himself says is reflected in flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which never ceases to surprise and evolve".
What draws the audience is not the performance of the dance, the singing, or the play itself but the personality and character of the performer.
Finding the moment to encounter the most essential, the spirit that manifests itself in the way of perceiving, being and experiencing, was and is a constant in the work presented during these days in the El Fotomata gallery.
This selection of almost seventy photographed artists is made up of well-known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, which will contain the exhibited portraits.
Two years ago, Bauer's passion for portraiture led him to the idea of repeating it in "Portraits of Sports Veterans" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from that of "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "photographing people, getting to know them and being able to step into their lives for a moment, whether it's longer or just a short one - that's my passion.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or clash with people, personalities that you sometimes don't even know or that only give you a few minutes to photograph.
Despite similar circumstances, I always try to make my images come true as a photographer".
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco artists entitled "Flamenco-people" is on display at the Galeria El Fotómata at 20 de la Mata Street, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he's writing is "boldness"
Set in an environment he does not yet know, and telling of events unknown to him, Mario Vargas Llosa is about to successfully realize his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose protagonist is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and also traveled in the Amazon.
The eternal favorite for the Nobel Prize in Literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia that the project he is currently working on is "a boldness" and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had my head, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe I will finish it one day", he concluded his speech at a festival of ideas, thoughts and words that saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of others gather in the Aqueduct City over four days.
The author of the novel "The City and the Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the Festival of the Word and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival's prize for best-loved novelist, an old edition of Dickens' Our Mutual Friend, filled the Juan Bravo theatre to the last spot.
With Félix Rome, who introduced him, he had before him a devoted audience whose time ran like water - the Peruvian with amazing precision and a noteworthy dose of humor recalled how he had gone from his original "incredible adventure" of "the pleasure of a passionate reader" and "the ability to live more than I have ever lived" to a literary mission; how he overcame "the lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinedly", carefully arranging, correcting and transcribing the text; or how his writing was influenced by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what "memorial images" are the basis of his stories.
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to know whether and to what extent books can change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is merely entertainment, a fleeting experience", stressed Vargas Llosa, saying that "it works on people" and "the movement is to try to stand out", and urged writers to "not succumb to frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their mission.
The weather is making the festival in Pozoblanc go down - the spears are missing
The spear show that closes the ceremony in Pozoblanc was canceled yesterday morning after the announcement of the performers that the surface of the square is not in good condition was confirmed.
Therefore, the company, together with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
The festival has been plagued by bad weather for a long time, and two of the three festivals have been canceled.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second scheduled bullfight.
During these, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to face the bulls in the arena at Castilblanco.
But it was only on a Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and was carried on his shoulder as a reward for his dynamic and aesthetically pleasing performance.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante traded two spear blows for greetings and an ear that was more from the bare seats in the arena than the art of bullfighting.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the bullring of Los Llanos unsalted and greasy.
In the second round of the breathless grind, he earned a sharp rebuke from most of the audience.
They got away in Alava in a van with 2,000 kilos of hashish.
In ten minutes, five.
Road control of Ertzaintza in the city district of Armiñón (Álava).
Officers stop two people in a van and they run away.
The cargo, over two tons of hash, is unstoppable.
According to a report from the Interior Department of the Basque Government, officers chased them and detained one of the people in the van, a 38-year-old man identified as A. A. J.
The man was arrested on charges of drug trafficking and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transportation Unit were conducting a road check on the N-1 at points where it crosses the border of the Armiñón municipal district.
They were about to stop the van to check, but the driver disobeyed instructions, accelerated, and drove off.
The car was immediately chased, and when it stopped at a roadblock a few miles away, both passengers jumped out and ran into the woods.
Ertzaintza agents eventually caught up with one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish that the suspects were transporting, as revealed by a search of an Iveco Daily van.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with packets of hashish, which were then transported to other police stations for detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "spotted" and did not match the information on the delivery documents, so the arrested man was also charged with falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the search for the second suspect, who, as mentioned, managed to escape, in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drugs.
Detainee A.A.J., 28, has been taken to the police station for formalities, pending further investigation.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence
Actress Heather Locklear, Amanda's favorite character from Melrose Place, was arrested in Santa Barbara, California, this weekend for driving under the influence.
A witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to exit the Montecito parking lot, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness stated that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "stepped on the gas, went back and forth in a loud roar, and tried to get out of the parking lot - reversing several times over her sunglasses".
A witness who apparently didn't recognize the actress at first saw Locklear moments after she pulled over on a nearby freeway and got out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the emergency services because "she was afraid for Locklear's life".
When a police patrol arrived at the scene, they found the actress inside a vehicle that had partially blocked the road.
"She seemed disoriented", so the authorities took her to a specialized drug and alcohol treatment center to undergo a test.
A police spokesman said the actress cooperated and the excessive alcohol was subsequently ruled out, but "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, as was apparent to officers at first glance".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and taken into custody at approximately 7:00 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a convalescent home where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
IU general manager and United Left MP Gaspar Llamazares said today that the final decision in the case of former Seville City Council member for Youth and Sports Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of acting in favour of his family, will be up to the regional party association.
"I am too federalist for that, it is up to the Andalusian organisation to exercise its powers", Llamazares suggested, a negotiation the party will have to make with the former Seville city councillor.
However, the IU chief insisted that "transparency" was absolutely necessary in the case of investigating illegal conduct committed by Silva: "IU has always fought to make such matters as transparent as possible".
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public offices".
"Sangre de mayo", the epic bet by Garcia.
José Luis García's film Sangre de mayo, inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's Episodes of National History, recreates the famous Spanish uprising against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography, with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "represent the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of society" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, during the presentation of the film to a large team of interpreters.
The two-and-a-half-hour movie Flower Blood will be released this Friday and will be followed by a four-hour TV series, Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of Galdosa's literary work, José Luis García claims that he fulfilled a "childhood dream" by making this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the Autonomous Province of Madrid to make a film for the bicentennial of Madrid on May 2, he accepted the offer, with the understanding that the plot would be based on the Episode of the National Past.
The 15 million budget, entirely contributed by the province of Madrid, represents a "unique opportunity" for García to create an environment with sets and costumes that reflect the image of "a thriving Spain that was mistaken for the leader it was worth fighting for - the struggle for independence led to the decline and backwardness of the country under Ferdinand VII", he said.
However, the director regrets that he could not count on the financial support received for the films Ala triste (The Sad Wing) or Goya's Ghosts - almost twice as much as Flower Blood - so he could not film some scenes from the script also signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has worked for almost his entire film career.
The director of Volver a empezar works as he normally does - on stage with actors he usually rehearses with before filming and does not cast them because he finds it "humiliating" and also believes that "part of the director's job is to go to the theaters and cinemas and find out what is going on in his trade".
Many of the actors he chose for Flower Blood have appeared in front of his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia, who has four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, believes that none of the three candidates representing Spain at the Hollywood Academy this year, Flower Blood itself, Seven Tables of French Billiards and the latest chosen Blind Sunflower, represent the younger generation of the Spanish film scene, but says that "it is yet to emerge".
Garcia is not expecting any awards for this film.
"At first you think you're working for what's next, but then you realize you're just working for the money, and you're just going to make one more movie", explains Garcia, a director for more than 30 years.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of the Sevillian dancer Tortola Valencia
The Sevillian flamenco dancer will pay tribute to another Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, born to a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and moved to London with her family when she was three.
She was a modern dancer, and she was a dancer who specialized in oriental dancing.
She lived a life of passion, she was a pioneer of women's emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and she fought to abolish the corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, was enchanted by Isabella Bayonne.
"I wanted to work with Peppa Gamboa and she suggested this character - I thought it was incredible".
According to the dancer, "we're not about telling her life story, we're about capturing her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So "butterfly dance" reminded me of guajiro or "serpent dance" a tango.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance was also in line with this aesthetic", she says.
The performance features two exceptional personalities: Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabela in one performance, as in "La puerta abierta", and dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to collaborate with her former pupil.
"Matilde is the elder Tortolo, a mature figure.
I am happy that she accepted the invitation to participate in my project, and I consider it a great honor".
The performance also features music and guitars by Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, vocals by Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; drums by El Pájar, viola by Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actor Juanfry Juarez, "who plays the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artists who are primadones with everything and always in love with everything".
The play also takes into account the life of this woman, who lived in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, as she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at a certain time, but no one knows her today, much less appreciates her work", says Bayon.
The show starts at 8:30 tonight at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "Diary of a Newlywed" closes the triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the Newlyweds' Diary in Saint Stephen's Church, New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their deaths.
The "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" is coming to a close with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the renovation of the Nobel House Museum and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Ray of Sun", which opened in May of this year and, after visiting various Andalusian provinces, is scheduled to move to New York in time for the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia also ordered 800 copies of the "Diary of a Newlywed" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue spreading awareness of the personality and work of one of the world's most famous Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman is not so much like each other anymore.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them".
Those are the words of actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "No Evil Intentions", and under the weight of the knowledge that Newman is gone, she reveals her disheartened vision of abandoned American cinema and America.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
And that he was retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be seriously ill.
Still, he was a big man to everyone.
"Sometimes what a man feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend", said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my country were better because of him".
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or overreacting.
The father of film and country died at a particularly dark time of fear of terrorism and financial markets, a time when American self-esteem is at an all-time low, a time when people are desperate for reasons to be proud.
When times are rough and people are devoid of virtue and only a handful of those you admire - you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all of us, he embodied an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a champion of lost and won cases, from the drug addiction foundation established in honor of his firstborn son who died of an overdose, to his own brand of home-cooked and organic food.
A treasure trove for a country that has struggled to rid itself of a suicidal food culture.
A storm of admiration swept Hollywood regardless of nationality or citizenship.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner for directing Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was without question the pinnacle of his career.
Bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"That fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us", observes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few people today who has the courage to try to live the life Paul Newman lived - one based on honesty and a serious private life away from the camera.
In today's media jungle, that is not always easy, sometimes even impossible.
But fortunately, there are such people, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he's been married for 50 years to Joanne Woodward, who he's been faithful to, even though he's certainly had more than enough opportunities not to.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have steak at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him be proud in heaven that on earth there is harmony between his daughters and admirers, which is not very common in America.
It has been said that "of all the great roles he played, he was most proud of being a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a self-sacrificing philanthropist".
The Imperfect Race of the Madrid Olympics
Yes, many of us are eager for the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after a failed 2012 it may be 2016.
But I ask you, are we ready?
If we're going to follow yesterday's race, I say no!
It was referred to as the perfect race, and in my judgment, it was the worst I've ever been to.
It's such a load of crap that if it came to an evaluation and I was an examiner, it would be clearly inadequate.
But let's take it from the top, one step at a time.
The nonsense starts with picking up a race number that makes you have to leave early.
I don't think it's a bad thing, but if you're going to go there, you should get everything you need (including a chip to prevent congestion).
No, you didn't.
Here, you had to pick up a number first (first nonsense, just to go there) and (after standing in line) - what a surprise! - they only had an S-size shirt (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
Where do we live?
Is it because of the recession that they decided to buy only small shirts because they're less fabric and cheaper?
Okay, well, that's nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Besides having to go very early for the chip and the line took over 15 minutes, he had to hand over the backpack.
The wait time was over 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we hadn't even unpacked, and once we did, the pickup was a lot worse.
The wait was extended by 40 minutes by the rain, which led to a general riot and an attack on the cabin.
I believe 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow, and some, like me, will not be able to get the right timing on the results because of the chip they gave me, which I assume didn't correctly mark my time of departure.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this one wouldn't come to mind.
So I guess we're just gonna have to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a virtual receptionist.
At the MIT New Technologies Conference, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in a new system for image recognition and human interaction in the form of artificial intelligence - not very intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks like calling a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a courier that would move around the company's premises) and perceiving what they hear in conversation.
Using a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, the receptionist can see how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they're wearing - and listen to and understand key words in their conversations.
He can also sort the audience by conversation groups.
In the demo video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that he is not part of the group talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she's seeing someone, and he tells her he'll be right with her.
All without a blue screen of death.
That's wonderful.
But of course, this is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to work on, like a new version of the Windows operating system.
There's been a lot of talk this week about Microsoft changing its strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will have fewer associated programs.
Steve Ballmer figured out that if computers had only the basics, without the burden of commercial redundancy, they would be five times more powerful -- man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
A breakthrough, considering that Microsoft is adding new features and extras to Windows version by version.
A change of course would be a merit.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its relevance and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came on the web, I became one of those who leaned toward the theory that it was Google's first step in competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it's the necessary layer for communication between hardware and software.
It's the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right, I did.
It never goes away, but you have to think of the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that point.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the web browser.
Your computer turns on to run Firefox or Explorer or Chrome, and we spend more time online every day than we do in front of our windows.
What's half the applications that come with the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a little example.
I took this picture in a Microsoft employee lounge in Redmond earlier this month.
There was a sign on the vending machine asking people to use their search engines: "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
By the way, last week, we confirmed a delay in the release of the new Windows Mobile 7 version.
It's not coming at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's just wait until 2010.
I'm sure Microsoft will be trying to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more of a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they'll have to pay dearly for the delay.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo DiCaprio shone in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond", as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "Godfather", and it's part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to delve into his life roles, we can dive right into the image of the typical muscular, pointy-moustached man lifting the dumbbells in a nomadic circus.
It's basically nothing more than a typical cotton underpants, fitting and sleeveless.
English speakers call it a tank, but le Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels stands above all others.
First, for his name, which is a nickname - although he is popularly called 'Marcel' - which is linked to sport, because, according to legend, he was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out for its high-quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost imperceptible) Belgian flag, which is a neck detail of the most iconic models.
And be careful, because the Belgian company doesn't just specialize in tank tops.
It also makes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, kids' suits, mini-shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, I don't care who the father is".
Her great likeness to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though a small character, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are taking their new fashion roles very seriously now.
For Monica, it means a lot more than just having some pretty, famous girl lend her name.
In Paris, she attended a promotional event organised by Mango at its new headquarters and the announcement of the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
She's warm and shy and she'll get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I'm here to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for Mango for this fall-winter season, and I'm also attending the second annual Mango Fashion Awards and a dinner at the Opera House in honor of Valentine.
So it was a hard day, but it was also an exciting one.
What's your new collection for Mango, where you've been working for four seasons?
My sister and I love movies from the '50s and '60s, and we've been inspired by them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk around in their clothes, combine and layer their clothes, which I do very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, so you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but in the end, everything is connected and has many connections.
I was a child who loved clothes, and I always wanted to go to my grandmother's house and look through my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to be careful about how I dressed.
You know, we dancers rely on how we're groomed to feel good in our classes and rehearsals when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, when you get a costume, that's when you really get into character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for the designers and the professionalism.
You just turned 30, you're having a crisis?
No, I'm not going to.
I feel better than I've ever felt before, 30 is fun.
I find that a woman is already done, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not scared of the biological clock.
I've been doing what I want since I was a kid, and it gives me a lot of inner happiness.
So are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course I know I'm gonna be a mother because my body wants me to be, and besides, I want to be a young mom, and I don't want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But I know one thing for sure, I will make my child feel happy and raise him with great love.
As for the movie, you're about to see the premiere of a couple of movies you made last year.
I am, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I come from the theater world, so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything now, and that's obviously not possible.
I'm looking forward to the premiere of "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ".
I'll tell you how you like them.
You had your premiere on the fairground a few days ago alongside Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to walk up to the pier like a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to attend a benefit show for her organization, Women for a Better Life, and the clothes we were showing -- I picked two models from our Mango collection -- went up for auction and the proceeds went to Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There are many rumors about her, and I, as someone who knows her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good stuff he's into.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asks me to do a stand, I'll do it.
For the sake of the women of the Third World, I will do whatever it takes.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install an "alcolock"
The Home Office requires drivers with three administrative penalties for DUI to have a system installed in their vehicle to prevent them from starting the car while drunk or not breathing.
The proposal was made public in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the Prosecutor General's Office, which states that it is a pilot project for a period of one year.
The aim is to get drivers back behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to undergo a road re-education course.
The experience will involve the National Road Safety Authority (NTSO) as well as the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Motor Vehicle Safety (FITSA).
Statistics show that between 30 and 75 percent of drivers who are accused of drunk driving more than once will get behind the wheel again.
Alcolock should prevent this as it is a vehicle-mounted system that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe first or if an alcohol concentration is recorded above the permissible level.
The price is over 1000 euros and the offender will have to pay for it.
A study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that the number of offences for vehicles equipped with this device fell by 65% in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that it could save 115 lives each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate its introduction, since legislation can be implemented in the usual way, the necessary adjustment of the penal provisions requires an amendment of the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has been tested on some commercial and public service vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on a proposal by the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) to install the system in school buses, as it is in France.
In Mexico and without peeptoes
At 5:40 p.m. British time, as scheduled, a Spanish Air Force plane carrying the Prince and Princess of Asturias landed at the presidential hangar at Benita Juarez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun had just set, but its rays still forced the hand to cover the eyes so that the following couple could be seen exiting the plane.
The Spanish ambassador and other officials were standing under the stairs.
A few hours ago, I asked a cab driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, it's not like she's gonna be able to get to the airport to pick up people...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's what I...
But the Mexican press knows who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and the significance of their visit.
Many people are waiting in the airport hangar, right by the red carpet and the military cordon, which is made up of 27 Marines ready to fire the honor salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on his face in a dark blue suit and the princess, very modestly dressed and with her hair unbuttoned, not wearing her usual peeptoes, apparently having been told that a storm is coming in D.F.
Before entering the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and pose for them.
At the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city, they are met by a chatty Mexican TV reporter.
Best subsidised fashion price
I don't think there's a better place in the world to announce a fashion award than Paris and I don't think there's a better designer and a better Bonvivan than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second annual El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow international exposure to new fashion talent.
The price is subsidised at EUR 300 000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, first year winner, was looking at her designs yesterday in the Manga gallery at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
Sure, it's the company's second largest store in Europe and it just opened on a 1,335-square-foot lot.
The biggest one is in London.
A series of events, coupled with a desire to thank the designers, Valentino, for presiding over the competition jury, led us to a lavish dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
The Mango-decorated chair table looked even more amazing compared to Chagall's most famous works.
With her heart broken and her brother's recent death, Nati, who had kept quiet, put on a dress of this brand and the breathtaking ELAH jewelry and, hanging on her son Luis - a nearly six-foot-tall, elegant man - accompanied Valentino to the head of the table at the dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took up the welcome and, like a true gentleman, he and Baron Rothschild were left without a jacket, as they both offered it to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who arrived at the store in hand-designed pants and shirts and dressed in a long, sexy black dress for dinner, was moved by the night walk around the Opera House with Goya Toledo, showed us the ballet rehearsal room, and in remembrance of other times, she grabbed one of the poles and pointed to the "grand plié".
Inés Sastre did not stay to tour the palace's outbuildings, but before leaving, she showed us photos of her son on her cell phone.
The next morning we were able to admire the presence of Oliver Martinez - another young man on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance that no scent be used in his rooms.
The stars under the starry Paris sky.
Oh, my God, that's life.
The amount to be reported in column 060 of this row: Original deduction according to Article 147 (2) (b) of the CRR.
Not a thousand, but a thousand plus one way to forget the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And to top it all off, they're all summed up in one book that will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30th.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 a.m. as punishment, but even worse is imagining yourself engulfed in the rushed rhythm that contemporary life brings.
The office is called tension and the computer is a pain in the back.
Stress is the disease of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
No, that number is not any more or less than 1,001.
Susannah Marriott, in addition to yoga poses, massage therapy, and spa therapy, has put together a menu of options in the pages of her book, tailored to each individual's taste and time options.
The book is called "1001 Ways to Relax" and is being published by Pearson Alhambra and DK to bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone feels that peace cannot be attained in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" contradicts that view.
It also offers other ways to be in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If your adrenaline, which helps restore balance, is no longer circulating and stress is a problem, it's time to sit down on the couch, shut down, and focus on reading.
Sleep-talking
Some children talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something about the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may scare you, but it's actually nothing.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called somnolence.
It's quite common, especially in children and teenagers.
I'm sure many of you have been told that he spoke in his sleep last night.
This may occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with a high fever) or more regularly (every day, once a week, once every few months, etc.) and the child does not remember anything the next day.
There's not one single reason for her coming.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (night-time urination), or sleepwalking, but this may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful situations, or a heightened mood.
In any case, it is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears also varies.
The child may speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or vice versa (screams, cries, long speeches, etc.).
In cases where it is strong, it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if there is a problem that causes the child to have a high level of anxiety and manifests itself in this way.
We said it's a harmless disorder, so it's not treated unless it's associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (like if it's associated with apnea syndrome or chronic stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to disturb the child too much before he goes to sleep.
So seek out peaceful games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who are given work to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the baby to sleep more peacefully.
If you have sleepwalking, try to stay calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything.
Useful Advice
Don't be him.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even though he talks, he's sleeping, and therefore resting.
Remember, if you repeatedly find that your child seems to be very distressed, it may be wise to seek counsel or to find out what is causing the child's anxiety.
If he understands what he is saying (which is not always the case), avoid the temptation to question him and extract information from him.
It's no use, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious enough to organize his thoughts.
Furthermore, you can hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming about or why he is saying it, so be very careful about how you interpret the information and draw conclusions.
Never tell a child that you can ask him his secret at night.
Not for fun.
It causes a lot of anxiety.
Don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's just an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last
Illhaeusern finally found a way to win again after a long period of lean.
Without playing a particularly big game, the Yellow and Black created more chances and managed to turn one of them into a victory.
The game was not very fast during this encounter, in which the attackers were only struggling to advance.
After the first attempt of the captain of the guest Kauffmann, who missed the clutch by a hair from a distance, Illhaeusern began to have a slight advantage and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne in the air, Romain on a long leg or Diebold gradually came to tease the defense of Dannemarie.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the field, leaving only the agile Riahi on the edge of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, firstly thanks to the two chances of Dannemarie with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the scoring for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well placed to handle the ball bounced after Diebold's previous attempt (53').
However, Gólman Illhaeuserna did not enjoy the joy for long, and after about 12 minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room, leaving his teammates in a state of weakness.
Dannemarie was unable to take advantage of this and the Illhaeusern XI, which had only slightly retreated to "thicken" the defense, caused no further problems, except for the very last seconds of the match when the ball passed very close to the stump after a great confusion.
Sarkozy goes to the angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride through Brittany.
To counter a show of force by fishermen who severely disrupted access to several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French president decided to head to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to be received "in a constructive spirit" and hope to "come with concrete proposals".
The President's visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the 'crisis committee' set up by Breton fishermen to seek action against the sharp rise in diesel prices, which have peaked at an average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysee Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the employment and pay conditions of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is a fisherman who is expected to be relentless.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out a "slug operation" in the Morbihan and Calvados departments, causing almost 10km of traffic jams.
The recreational port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-Île were not interrupted.
A filtration dam has been put into operation on the Quiberon Peninsula.
Seafarers showed their determination as early as Monday when they set fire to tires and pallets at dawn in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where trawlers remained in port, or Le Havre, where some 20 vessels blocked trade traffic.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisique in the Loire-Atlantique region stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer people have decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before they decide to act on their own.
The 'crisis committee' is due to decide on Tuesday in Guilvinec on how to proceed and on its participation in a planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the state fisheries department, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give up" and "they do not want to come to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, chair of the fisheries department in Laurent.
Professional fishermen who do not pay diesel tax currently pay about 50 cents a litre, but they feel that the threshold for a ship's profitability is only reached when the diesel is below 0.30 euros a litre.
Paul Newman is magnificent.
The unforgettable Butch Cassidy and the Kid star has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes paid tribute to the legend of cinema and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on the delivery of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of recession looming over the global economy.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, is maintaining its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer has a lot of promise from the Chinese market, especially given the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers over a period of eight years.
AIG is reportedly considering a 15% asset sale.
American International Group, an insurer that has been bailed out by the U.S. monetary authorities, is considering selling more than 15 percent of its assets to pay off $85 billion in down payments, reports the Financial Times on Sunday.
AIG is prepared to consider selling off most of its non-life insurance business in the international field and its pension business in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources familiar with the ongoing negotiations.
France Télécom's comments were therefore rejected.
No confirmatory statement could be obtained from AIG.
The assets to be divested by AIG include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision on these transfers has yet been taken, France Télécom continues.
AIG needs to raise cash quickly to repay an $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve, at the risk of the U.S. government seizing 80% of its capital, diluting its current shareholders to a proper degree.
Paris: analysis of the historic morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange fell to a record low on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's bank bailout plan: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen 777.68 points to 10,365.45.
The biggest drop in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, the day trading resumed after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index with a predominantly technology component lost 199,61 points to 1 983,73 at the close of trading and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,55 points.
Dejected from the start of the session, Wall Street has literally collapsed after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected a bank bailout plan that was supposed to allow markets to regain some stability.
By a vote of 228 to 205, the House of Representatives has refused to grant Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson the funds he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal to the market that Congress is not able to pass a plan", believes FTN Financial's Lindsey Piegza.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan", she added, expressing concern that the project, adopted in a few days, might come "too late".
"If this project is really doomed . . . , the baton will be immediately passed to the Fed and other central banks to stoke the crisis, further tightening credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And stressing the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States "every new day brings the downfall of a financial institution".
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities arranged for Wachovia Bank's banking activities to be purchased by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has taken a sudden turn and called for urgent intervention in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are facing 'not just an American crisis but a global crisis,' added an FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The 10-year treasury bill yield dropped to 3,632% from 3,827% on Friday night, the 30-year yield to 4,161% from 4,357% the day before.
Obama won points in his first televised duel
After Friday's first debate between the two candidates in the White House, the second debate was held to determine who among John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters were not surprised when both declared victory in a televised duel that was watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to halt, five weeks before the presidential election, the decline in opinion polls.
Gallup, whose opinion poll released Saturday puts Obama five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), says the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters who matter, Obama is the winner for 39% of those polled, while a CBS poll puts McCain at 25%.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected performance of his running mate Joseph Biden in his first and only public debate with his opponent Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's gifted", noted Bill Clinton, however, about the weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while also highlighting his opponent's "naivety" on the issues that were at the heart of the first encounter.
"It seems Senator Obama has failed to understand that"... was the repeated charge.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president", he added.
That's the offensive spirit that's been going on since last night's Republican TV commercial.
Obama, on the other hand, insisted that he was the future.
He didn't lose his head and he proved to be concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make good decisions and restore the good name of the United States to the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, while Obama does", a Democratic commercial responded over the weekend, blaming the Republican for not taking the impact of the crisis into account enough for "the average American".
"In the 90-minute debate, this John McCain guy had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama told a crowd of 20,000 at a rally in North Carolina yesterday in a downpour.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "working class". Financial decay clearly benefits Obama, who the Americans see as more likely to save an economy on the brink of collapse.
"Next week could be a watershed moment", predicted influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to that of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is "the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policies as implemented by George Bush and as supported by Senator McCain".
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite Wall Street's unexpected jumps, he should be able to reduce taxes for 95 percent of Americans, and also pointed out that realizing the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with introducing a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, plans to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates have carefully avoided questions about the $700 billion bailout plan passed by Congress last night, which is highly unpopular.
"What, did you notice there was an election in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the results of the parliamentary elections.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after polling stations closed on the main square in Minsk to protest the irregularity of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been announced yet, many young people have come to demonstrate against the regime of President Lukashenko: "dictator, resign".
Some admit that they did not even vote: "What's the point of doing whatever they want with my vote anyway", says one youth.
He does not believe that the regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian leaders and asset freezes, could be lifted if the election is deemed clean by election observers.
According to the opposition, it was not.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes", complained Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse grouping of 12 parties.
"It is a cosmetic change", stresses Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, "because who counts the votes is important, and in our country it is the executive.
If any opposition MPs get into Parliament, it will be by being nominated, not elected.
Their entry into parliament, however, may mean television space, regional meetings and draft laws".
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political process because "a dialogue with the European Union is needed.
Because if our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we don't reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
But we want to be independent".
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been monitoring the election, will not declare the election valid.
It stresses that turnout appears to be too high and that the widespread introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way to all possible manipulations.
"Did you notice that there were elections?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was not a foot in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five opposition MPs in Parliament, those who are most in line with the regime".
The night silence has once again filled October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Conversation - Blood That Is Sure Again
Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly delighted that Héma-Québec had become one of the most reliable and efficient blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he has regained the public's trust, which was seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
It is well known that the national blood bank administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service was contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980's.
In response to this drama and a wave of public disapproval, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, presided over by Justice Horace Krever, to explain the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to recommend that such a disaster not be repeated.
While Judge Krever delayed in delivering the report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood administration system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélinea Committee took on this role.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, to manage Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Company to supply all provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Québec began operations in 1998, only 38 percent of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system", recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was depressing.
Through our continuous efforts to improve the safety of blood products and our continuous work in this area over the years to come, we have rebuilt public confidence", he says, proudly adding that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population had trusted Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is a very fragile thing".
The principle of prudence has been applied by Héma-Québec since its creation on 28 September 1998.
"At that time, we were seeing many cases of a human-like form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease", says a woman who has been running the company since its inception in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could be spread through blood.
We therefore based ourselves on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report, which states that, where we do not know and where there is a risk of spreading a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterised by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, exclusionary measures should be taken.
So in April 1999, we refused blood from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Then, a few years ago, it was safely proven that the disease is transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that the precautionary principle made sense".
In 1999, a much more accurate HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which directly detect the presence of the virus itself in donor blood rather than the presence of antibodies on which previous tests were based.
NAT tests have shortened the deaf period between the time a patient is infected and when our blood tests can detect the first viruses, explains the specialist.
We've managed to shorten this period to less than a week.
We've reduced the risk of some donors getting infected without them knowing and without us knowing.
This improvement has made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of contracting HIV-tainted blood.
"In other words, it would take 12 million blood products to be distributed before someone could become infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission via a blood product is detected.
I think we can now safely receive or prescribe blood transfusions needed for healing", says Héma-Québec's chief executive.
"The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
You never know what pathogenic element might show up in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus, like the West Nile virus, was discovered on Réunion Island and is transmitted through the bloodstream by insect bites.
"We need to be vigilant at all times", she continues, stressing that Héma-Québec must not only have a secure supply but also a sufficient supply.
"Needs are increasing as the population ages.
Because of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has implications for the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of eligible Quebecers".
Any healthy person at least 18 years of age who meets the eligibility criteria but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people who donate blood are not accepted because they have, for example, AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where the mudslides are common, they are banned for a year.
"With this 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
The flaws are very rare.
However, the number of members of the donor network should be increased in proportion to their age and to the extent that they are no longer able to donate blood.
However, persuading people to donate blood is difficult, especially when it comes to keeping and encouraging them to become regular donors.
Life is so unrestrained today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood", sighs Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is used almost exclusively for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also operates the only public cord blood bank in Québec.
The umbilical cord, once considered biomedical waste, is now teeming with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated the deposit of our first 1,000 cord blood samples a few weeks ago and expect to collect over 1,000 a year.
We should start offering them for transplantation early next year", says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood program as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it", because Héma-Québec does not have the resources to offer this complex and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montreal qualified for the semi-finals of the USL First Division knockout round yesterday at Saputo Stadium in the second and deciding game of the quarterfinals, with a 3-1 victory over the Seattle Sounders.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a goalless first half, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino added the Montreal formation's two remaining goals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could beat Matt Jordan to the Sounders.
On Friday, in the first of two quarterfinal games, the Impact were defeated 2-1 at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder tied the deficit 3-1, and eventually won 4-3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinals with a 5-4 overall record.
The Impact is scheduled to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will not be confirmed until today.
In short, Kovalev's winning goal.
The first three offensive linemen of the Canadiens are ready to start the season.
A squad of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekance and Andrei Kosticin last night at the Bell Centre encouraged the offense to win the Canadiens 3-2 on a home run.
Kosticin, the star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists and Kovalev collected one assist in this fourth victory for the three-color out of six preliminary games.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during the separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet", the Russian warned.
"I need one more fight to feel good".
"He tried to do too much in the first quarter", Guy Carbonneau remarked.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a big round of applause".
Charest is betting on the north.
The Prime Minister has not ruled out calling an early election before the end of the year.
Immediately after the Liberal Party congress, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is running in today's by-election.
"Remove the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually compelling way at the conclusion of the Quebec Liberal Party Congress in Lévis, without giving any details.
During his speech, pictures were projected behind his back in a sort of picture mill.
There was a loop of three huge screens with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from Google Maps, maps, etc.
Generous funds, just like the election period.
At a press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out an early election in the fall, although he did note that he has a very busy schedule.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth dimension of the Prime Minister's vision for Quebec, a vision of a "new economic area" that includes a labour agreement with France, a Canada-Europe Convention and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the opening up of the North - the Northern Territory at the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has often mentioned in his statements recently, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, merely explained why the North is a "jewel of enormous potential", but did not give a timetable, the amount of investment or a clear priority for future projects.
He mentioned at most a few approaches to the points that could be further diversified: in particular hydroelectric power plants, forests, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the rapid growth of developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
The North, Charest's list says, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "area twice the size of France is here", is in Quebec.
And it's not just with us, it's in us", he stressed, as if to show that he was invoking a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built largely in relation to the North, the Prime Minister pointed out: the Abitibi gold rush, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future", he added after theatrically silencing himself to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70 percent of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always claimed, the premier said during a press conference.
"This is a traditional position that has been repeated by all previous governments.
There is one boundary line which has long been without a convention and if the opportunity arises, I will take this position again on behalf of the government", he indicated.
Otherwise, "we also need to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change", he said, referring to the north-west passage that will open year-round as a result of melting glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the land, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former Pequista member of Parliament from Ungava), have already started negotiations with some 30 communities.
The Interministerial Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier and with Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) in a key role, launched the work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a shared vision will be outlined".
The development of the North should, moreover, be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "co-designed, structured and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a seamless continuation of the vision of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals before us, we have changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
That was one of the more heated topics of the weekend, which kicked off Friday with a big cocktail celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's rise to the party's leadership.
One of the resolutions passed proposes to rename the Beauharnois plant to the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who led the Quiet Revolution and nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourasso, who created James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future", said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he referred to another authority, this time a conservative, and that was the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it came time for the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"Just between us, but I plan to be there", he told his membership, prompting a standing ovation.
The same Prime Minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and no doubt in 2009 did not rule out the possibility of calling elections this autumn, which is allowed by law.
However, he stressed that his agenda was full, especially the Federal Council's mission to China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend's convention provided the Liberal leader with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "attempts to amend the constitution", which passed very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) specifically demands recognition of "the specificity of Quebec" in the constitution.
It also wishes Quebec to appoint a section of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council who would have the right to veto decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition was skeptical of the North Plan in its main features.
The leader of the PQ (Parti Québécois) Pauline Marois has reiterated the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it abandoned the implementation of this policy.
If she had kept her word, "we would have gone on today", said Marois, standing next to her Jean-Talon candidate, François Mercure.
ADQ said they would support the adoption of the Plan North in the government.
"But we hope it is not just a theatre", explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from holiday today.
Letters - The Unhonored Land
It was Vic Toews, former Justice Minister in Harper's cabinet, who dared to say last summer that Louise Arbour was a "disgrace" to Canada.
To humiliate a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration in this way says a lot about the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government that is the only Western country that has not deported a citizen of its own country from Guantanamo Bay.
A government that ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager when the crimes he is accused of were allegedly committed.
The only government that, despite Canada being a signatory to the Geneva Convention, is denying its word and letting a child soldier rot in inhuman conditions.
The only one that relies on a mock trial to determine the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and especially the Canadian Bar Association are advocating for Omar Khadr's repatriation to Canada to await a fair trial.
The same government is turning a blind eye to torture: it cares little that this young man is now psychologically destroyed, and no doubt permanently, after so many years of torture.
We may not realize it, but we are witnessing a creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", words that Harper so proudly uses and that come out of his mouth so empty.
The time has come when there is no morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to mistreat him, to imprison him at the whim of the head of a minority government (as it will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe they can find salvation in a party that preaches Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Opinions - The Orwellian Discourse of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir, a letter was printed by Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of Barrick Gold, a Canadian mining company.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has filed a defamation suit against three authors and a poor little publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate" and demands $6 million from them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truth, especially in the case of defamation, but the law.
Not surprisingly, Garver completely ignores this essential distinction.
Or is the best way for Barrick Gold to conduct a public debate to bankrupt anyone who dares to take a different position?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada will be forced to spend a respectable sum of money to be prepared to defend and fight a very uneven battle with an army of lawyers backed by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
The tactic in these unbalanced battles often involves bankrupting the defendants in order to secure a settlement that will silence the other side and, moreover, frighten anyone who dares to take up the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, they should have put their views on the whole thing out there.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada the debate is normally an exchange of ideas, not a whipping.
So the mining companies were not satisfied with just opening their books, opening their documentation and setting up a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding independent scientific teams that could shed light on the whole thing.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to lack public confidence and has been ruthless in rejecting petitions and letters in support of the Noir Canada authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand "public debate" and at the same time despise the views of the same public?
It seems that in the vice president's world, that word only refers to the high-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; that's a pretty narrow definition of the term.
In a democracy, even the lawbreakers have a right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada is doing so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of the mining company.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge the case, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant is to be silenced (in its prosecution of "public debate", Barrick, by the way, has just issued an official appeal to the authors of Noir Canada to officially notify them to stop using the term...).
If we leave aside Garver's surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university's freedom to investigate and seek the truth, which is fundamental to any democratic society.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual activity.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss topics that are not popular with the rich corporations of the world without being subject to repeated prosecution, who else can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have had one if it followed the scientific standards that the authors of Noir Canada use.
He's entitled to an answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debate and disagreement and resolve conflict.
Barrick Gold's overblown lawsuit makes it clear that despite what it claims, it has no desire to have a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it's time for governments to put in place measures to curb this type of unwarranted prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally agreed yesterday on the largest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the $700 billion plan to contain a financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
It provides in particular for: better control by elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money deposited, new measures to capture the number of houses seized for non-payment and also the right to monitor the salaries paid to managers of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican House Majority Leader Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news yesterday just minutes after midnight, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective in markets", said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Everything was done to keep the real economy and ordinary Americans safe from the crisis that is now taking place on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"That's the bottom line: If we don't do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption to the American everyday life will be huge", said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the past few hours, negotiations have been going to maximum speed for fear of the effect another failure would have on investor sentiment.
The deadline was for the markets to open this morning.
Both candidates for the US presidency were invited to negotiate later, and both spoke more in favour of the deal, but without neglecting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama credited the amendment to the agreement with some measures, in particular the one aimed at allowing homeowners to keep their homes and the wage measures for the heads of state-bailed-out companies.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is no need to congratulate them.
But these measures are necessary", he explained on television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so".
"The rough features I have read [show] that it is something we all will have to deal with and move on with.
Choosing to do nothing is simply unacceptable", he said.
The goal of the $700 billion plan is to use taxpayer money to buy back dubious claims and risky and unsellable assets of U.S. financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of the housing bubble, which first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages, then moved to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA), and resulted in a cash freeze and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
The failure of last week's first draft of the agreement is on the Republican side of the House.
Once the Democrats have accepted that some of the "toxic" assets of troubled companies will be only guaranteed by the government, not bought, there is a belief that a dead end is being avoided.
In an effort to reconcile conflicting views in Congress, a provision was added that would allow the government to introduce new fees to help it recover its deposit if it had to take losses for five years as a result of the program.
The new plan calls for a first payment of $250 billion, with the possibility of an additional $100 billion if the president sees fit.
The additional $350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire shares in the rescued companies, which will pay dividends if they make a profit, and which it can sell again when it's all over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the impoundment procedures for loans covered by the plan, as well as set limits on the amount of valuation and compensation paid to executives of affected companies.
The plan's makers would like to put it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it's not clear if their plan will be greenlit.
Yesterday, the vote against this bill continued to rise in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
"It's obvious Washington can't hear you", Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But making money off taxpayers is not the answer".
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, moderator of a congressional group dubbed the "Skeptics Committee", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred respected economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us asking Congress not to rush too far and to carefully consider the way forward", he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe has reaffirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
Following the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the acquisition of its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since losing EUR 2 billion (USD 2.9 billion) as a result of the US housing crisis.
Fortis employs 85 000 people, is among the 20 largest European banks and one of the 10 largest insurers.
"We will not lose this money", Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we gain voting rights in the bank and influence.
And that is what savers and households can appreciate in these uncertain times".
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government appears to have begun nationalizing another bank hit by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) were real estate loans.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will acquire the branches and accounts of the British bank's clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalised by the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - The death of a socially engaged icon
His beauty with his blue eyes had long been his trump card, others said his weakness.
Has this American actor with a charming smile escaped narcissism?
Yes and no.
His shyness, his sensitivity and his unrelenting talent also kept him from the power category that breeds true stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died Friday at the age of 83 at his Connecticut ranch from lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the "fat years" of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, to whom he was similar and long a rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots, one of the most famous faces of the American dream was born.
Without the over-the-top ego, which is the ultimate mark of quality.
Because he was the face of this entire country in love with a self-made man, a war veteran in the Pacific, wounded in battle, who studied acting at Yale in the early '50s, went to the Actor's Studio in New York, and celebrated triumph in theater, television and, eventually, film.
The same civil rights activist was also a race car driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans and a sex symbol, despite having been a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
And with it, the shadowy places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the noise of her own show business, which will forever remain somewhat mysterious.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend has caused film buffs to feel dizzy as his big roles compete on the dark screen of memory.
It's been a parade of more than half a century of ever-changing American seventh art.
The charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, a 1958 adaptation by Tennessee Williams, reemerges in memory.
From a more recent past (1990) we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not live up to all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Rocky Graziano, the repressed, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role originally intended for James Dean, taken over after his death, which brought Newman to real fame in 1956.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
The bitter and vindictive billiards player in Robert Rossen's amazing The Hustler (1961), he would play the same character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which would earn him his only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face that's been traveling for ages, that was him.
And he did.
He's had a career that's been a rivalry between different eras.
Young people know him best from the cult classic Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977) as Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
He then closed his career playing the Irish mob godfather in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003.
Unlike a few film legends who left the business fairly soon, Newman remained in the business long after, though he denounced Hollywood for its glitz, glitz and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, considered it "a lively challenge to underplay", judging that he was pushing the envelope too hard in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom roles came like a tray, the profession was not always so tender.
But he played first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, thugs and desperados, whose declines and rebellions were reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed the little-known side of his shy sensibilities.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian author Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
He dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to his son Scott, who died of an overdose.
In a tribute to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former fellow fighter Robert Redford (the two starred in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) lamented, "His presence made my life and this country better".
Generosity, love of life, these are the main qualities of a deceased actor.
If we leave his legendary career behind, we also leave a great civil rights activist, environmentalist, independent filmmaker, anti-Hollywood decadence.
We were used to seeing his image on bottles of vinegar, sauces, cookies, and other foods, which might have seemed rather tasteless, although it was a gag at first.
However, the proceeds from the sale went into his Foundation for Troubled Childhood.
So, rather than be swayed by fame, Newman stayed involved in the community until the last minute.
He left a letter to his five daughters that included these words: "Always and to the end, your father was grateful for his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here".
And it has been an honor to follow the career of such a visionary and generous American artist.
And, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced at the Zuschlag & Co. invoicing factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial will begin in the criminal case against János Zuschlag and his associates.
The politician and his accomplices are accused, among other crimes, including forgery, of a long-term and systematic fraud by a criminal organisation, which has caused exceptionally significant damage.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, they used the money raised in public tenders for their own purposes and often used fictitious invoices to prove their tasks.
The money from the state and local governments - some 65 million forints in total - went partly to the treasury of Fiatal Baloldal and partly to the pockets of individuals.
The methodology also reported by the Office was that the money raised in the public tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real consideration and the commitments made were never received by the association.
According to the prosecution, a large portion of the invoices were forged.
The forms for these invoices came from the market in Józsefváros, the round stamp was made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names of the companies in which the invoices are to be produced were decided, among other things, on a circular route along the northern shore of the Balaton, on which István Lados was sent by János Zuschlag.
According to his statement, the first appointment was to look for guesthouses and restaurants.
In these documents, he requested invoices for his consumption, which were then used to produce invoices submitted in public tenders drawn up by, inter alia, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of the Capital respectively.
The invoices were mostly issued by István Lados with his partner András Őr, who according to our information wrote most of the reports needed to obtain the subsidies.
On his "study trip", Lados saw a basement.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, the establishment catered for a group of 90 members of Biztos Pont.
But the company executive said that so many people would not be able to fit into the facility at once.
The invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later to Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was also full of formal and substantive errors.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, and more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet the bill listed 130 guests.
However, the imaginative printers went too far when they listed a company also engaged in hospitality, Pigal s.r.o., whose accounts did not even contain documents bearing the names of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá, according to information provided to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Győző Farkas, the head of the company, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
"Our business name and tax number were on the stamp in the wrong place".
He added that, in addition to formalities, the fact that they accommodated 100 people according to the invoice was also not acceptable, since they only have 11 rooms, which do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the invoice also listed the food, and their restaurant has not been operating for a long time.
The eager invoicers were also not convinced that the prominent Budapest travel agency only organised international trips and mistakenly listed the cash-only invoice as a travel agency in Hungary, which was also inconsistent with the company's invoicing practices.
Moreover, as was revealed during the investigation, VAT was also mentioned in the document, although the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
In the four documents issued to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s.r.o., Hotel Révfülöp s.r.o. also disagreed with the amount of VAT, since the company's activities are not subject to the 25% VAT rate but to the 15% VAT rate, and the hotel staff only issued printed invoices, but the invoice produced was handwritten.
Moreover, the 'issuers' distorted the invoice, for example by stating that one company was carrying out, as revealed by the investigation of the Public Prosecutor's Office, a road haulage activity which the company originally based on investment advice did not carry out.
The fact that the invoices issued to the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért foundations and to the XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont associations are false was also revealed by the formal deviations - the incorrect format of the invoice and the incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna K.S. or the Kunfeherto Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they issued the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that HIB s.r.o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001) when it was catering to a group from Fiatal Városért, which is why, according to our information, the company's liquidation commissioner also denied that he had issued the paper.
They're knowingly issuing invoices.
The second group of invoicers is those who knew they were to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for around HUF 4 million for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták organisation.
The head of Collab s.r.o. was, according to the indictment, induced to issue a fictitious account by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Biogate s.r.o., currently in liquidation, also cooperated with Zuschlag and its partners and supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő associations with invoices worth around HUF 5 million in 2003, which were not actually economic.
Nor the movement of money, because the invoices generated were later cancelled, which the organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
The other group of invoicing firms included those with ties to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was an authorised representative of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trió s.r.o., a company engaged in the trade of fuels and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, but not located there.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the information obtained by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment s.r.o., a company in Kiskunhalas which was in liquidation as of 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian man to whom, between 2002 and 2005, Ivan Kubatov was also alleged to have handed over documents related to the company.
As we know, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted to issuing invoices on behalf of the company to the associations Atlas, Hoppa and the foundations Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and to accepting their consideration himself.
The Romanian masons established Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k.s. specifically at the request of Ivan Kubatov.
In fact, none of the companies were working, according to the defendant, because they were not getting jobs.
Nevertheless, the undertakings were in favour of him, since, at the request of his co-defendant, Zsolt Szente, who also drew up their instruments of incorporation, he issued invoices on their behalf to the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció, which were affiliated to Zuschlag.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov has issued a total of 15 invoices to the organizations, worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor's office determined that Kubatov had obtained 10 percent of the amounts shown on the invoices and VAT.
The man also used Szi-Beri k.t. to issue fictitious invoices, this time for the Biztos Pont tender.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért associations submitted proposals to the public tender of the Mihály Táncsics Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organisation of the Socialist Party.
They each received 500 thousand forints, but they did not use the amounts for the purposes set out in the proposals.
To avoid this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s.r.o.
These invoices were found during a search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants will likely describe the process of producing invoices, as they did at the prosecutor's office.
What may be more interesting is if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to reveal everything himself.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to explain everything in detail, he has not done so yet.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, 50 million forints, maybe the Socialists have made a deal with him and Zusi will take it.
He could have been offended, for his requests for a reduction in the conditions of his detention, namely house arrest, have so far not been heard.
While economic offenders who have committed much greater damage and have not yet paid for it can walk around freely or at least wait for the end of their proceedings in their homes, he does not have that option.
The psychology of bullying: Why are we spending more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overpriced goods.
The neurological and economic underpinnings of this familiar - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been revealed by researchers at New York University's Department of Neuroscience and Economics.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to fall behind in eBay-style auctions, so they pay too high a price.
Researchers have used an experimental auction to try to map out the pattern of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in a simulated auction, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine the active areas of the subjects' brains.
In both games, the participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the important element is to beat the other side, the whole under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to work intensively when the loser lost.
This area of the brain plays a role in the "self-reward" mechanism of the nervous system, among many other functions.
The researchers therefore believe that the price escalation can be explained by the effort to avoid a sharp reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the members of the research team of economists conducted a financial cross-sectional study.
Three groups competed against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, the other group was promised an additional $15 reward if they won the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but if they lost, they lost that money too.
So the difference between the two groups was that one group was emphasizing winning and the other group was emphasizing losing.
However, the members of the "loser" group were willing to go higher than those in the control and "winner" groups, confirming the neuroscientists' hypothesis.
"These results cannot be derived from any pre-existing economic theory.
They have so far explained the phenomena of winning and risk-avoidance.
Neural imaging has helped us resolve the discrepancy between the two theories, and we have now come to a third explanation", says Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Some half a billion people worldwide have chronic hepatitis B or C infections, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is listed as a leading cause of death.
The estimated number of domestic cases of hepatitis is 100,000, but only 7,000 are treated because patients often do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is a collective term for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
Although the symptoms are similar, with hepatitis and jaundice being the most common, the causes and the diseases they cause are different.
Depending on the source of the disease, hepatitis viruses spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretions, saliva).
Travellers should in any case protect themselves by vaccinating against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against virus C.
Hepatitis A symptoms appear two to three weeks after eating an infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, stomach problems, and vomiting.
Then, the skin and eye whites will turn yellow, the stool will lighten and the urine will darken, and the treatment may take two to three weeks.
Each year, a million people worldwide die from the more serious form of the disease, liver cancer and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that only one in ten infected people is estimated to be receiving medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer.
Most people who are infected are unaware of their disease, and the disease destroys liver cells in a subtle way, so the first symptoms often do not appear until 20 or 30 years later.
Therefore, early prevention and regular screening are very important.
Three groups of people are much more common than average: people who received blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can be detected by routine laboratory tests, a person should contact his or her doctor if he or she experiences any symptoms of unknown origin.
If detected early, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, and infectiousness and cancer can be prevented.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, which was first celebrated globally in 2004 by organisations representing the sick.
It aims to draw attention to the chronic hepatitis caused by these viruses, its causes and the importance of early detection.
Who believes in God, doesn't it hurt so much?
According to recent research, faith in God acts as a kind of painkiller that may have eased the death of already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment to examine how belief in a god influences a person's perception of pain, reports Britain's Telegraph newspaper.
In a rather bizarre study, they subjected 12 Catholics and an equal number of atheists to electric shocks while all of them were looking at a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholics were able to eliminate much of the pain.
A technique that examines the human brain in detail has also shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
The research is the first in a series of studies involving academics as well as scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The test was carried out with precision by attaching a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the subject that gave electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to look intently at two paintings: Sassoferrato's 17th-century Virgin Mary and Leonardo da Vinci's 15th-century Lady with an Arch.
The authors hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a certain state of piety in believers, whereas da Vinci's painting was chosen because it is not too different from the first and, they say, has a soothing effect.
Subjects spent 30 minutes in an MRI scanner and received 20 electric shocks in four successive sessions while separately viewing a religious or general-themed image.
Catholics reported that looking at the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "taken care of", and "calmed down, filled with peace".
They reported that when they saw a religious painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they saw Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the study, believes that any highly impressive image can have a similar effect on atheists, as long as the right photograph is found.
"We need to find an image that they will see very positively, from the mother's or father's perspective", said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the study.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases change our personalities", Wright added.
After such excellent results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the pain regulation of the faithful if they were shown a Madonna by Leonardo or a painter of similar calibre.
Would looking at a quality Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you give
On its tenth birthday, Google can say that people can find it in their pockets at least as easily as in the sky above them; they know where they've been on vacation, what professional exams they're taking and what they're interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, that's still not enough.
But for the skeptics who are drawing parallels with Orwellian darkness, the very nature of Web 2.0 is not clear.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about its users, which is necessary to keep up with the original goal of the founders: "Let's organize all the information in the world!"
According to a confessed Google official, after ten years of world-class work, the company is still at the beginning of its ability to handle all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "what should I be doing tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would I be doing?" - seemingly simple questions that software won't be able to answer until it knows enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the exact words they search for are captured during the Internet search, as well as the IP address from which the search was made and the pages to which the searchers have moved after the search.
The Personalized Search service, launched two years ago, allows users to save their browsing history, look back at what they searched for and clicked on, and in the long run generate results that are more tailored to them. The Recommendations service will also be based on the same logic, offering products and services based on previously stated and stored preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm doing? - users who are afraid of Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the scope of the potential power represented by the company is more intimidating, the backlash does not evoke guilt, fear of punishment, a desire for freedom or even rebellion against power in Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that all search terms are not only intercepted but can also be released to a third party in justified cases, in which case the privacy rights of internet users are not protected by law.
Perhaps the most famous recent example was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from Orkut community sites it had set up.
But Internet users who are concerned about privacy rights were given a break in May when the company, along with the electronic rights organization EFF, successfully proved its case against the FBI: Google must not be forced by any article of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully recovered nearly 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had obtained by invoking a strengthening of the Child Protection Act passed years ago, but it still failed to obtain lists of individual user searches, or complete lists of websites and keywords spanning a two-month period.)
The view of Google is thus quite contradictory: it is whipped by those who are afraid to give their personal data away because they feel that their privacy and privacy will be compromised by starting to use Google services, and they are speaking out against it with a revolt that belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
And yet the American geek culture and its wild offshoot, a group of enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users emerging in many countries, see him as the next generation of big business, the "corporation that's thriving now", unlike its rival Microsoft, which is seen as the conqueror of the world because of Windows, even though they're both fighting for the same goals.
This may be because, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require its users to provide an identification code or to pay for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and software packages seems much more accessible, younger, 'cooler' than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks have a very good understanding of the very problematic relationship between the Internet and privacy rights, which has brought about one of the most talked about buzzwords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Because Web 2.0 is nothing but collaboration, about intentionally leaving behind footprints and using the channels of communication that we have at our disposal, and although the scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show up.
The average young person can maintain a profile on a few community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can easily link to other services like Twitter or the last.fm app that records the music they listen to, all of which can then be linked to navigation systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and they can also write a blog that automatically shows their latest photo gallery that they upload to Flickr or Picasa.
There are many examples of this happening: a friend in the morning can easily see a flood of photos of mutual friends and figure out who her wacky boyfriend spent the evening with, or a company can fire an employee simply for posting their honest opinion about top management on their blog.
The one who lives the online life is made up of what he shows himself to be, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least avoid Google's monopoly, has a choice (starting with Scroogle, which uses Google's search engine but deliberately leaves no trace).
For example, a lot of people deliberately don't register on community sites so they can't be found, and Google's online apps, from text editor to photo editor to news portal, can be swapped out for alternatives that aren't connected to huge server parks and don't build the best profile of us.
Public opinion is not too secretive about waiting for Google to show its teeth.
The company, now worth $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense ad space is jeopardizing advertising agency investment, and the ever-accelerating pace of service introduction is seriously upsetting not only Microsoft but many other software designers.
Critical observers, however, find some disturbing counterpoints: for example, top management's total rejection of employee protests after doubling the company's tuition fee, the company's view that any frequent meals were too expensive, all of which are lost on Google's 2006 submission to the Chinese government, which, under its agreement, filters any findings that are in the good taste or interest of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when they are ready to use, but what is certain is that the expected problems of the coming months and years may take the world to new places: while some believe that Google's project to scan and archive books and magazines is growing to such an extent that the company will soon be facing the US Supreme Court, others are terrified of its Health system, where we can build our own complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can then serve as a good starting point for future generations of science fiction writers, and Cory Doctorow's famous novel "Scroogled" describes in Orwellian terms a future where humans can only be intimately approached with Google data.
Two teenagers helped a double murderer from Oz clear his tracks.
Two juveniles questioned by police in the case of a double murder in Ozd, are believed to have helped clear the traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County Police Department said on Tuesday.
The individuals suspected of the activity have confessed and are currently charged with aiding and abetting.
Both juveniles, two girls, are wanted on the loose, according to MTI.
Aiding and abetting a crime is punishable by up to five years in prison.
A suspect in a double homicide in Oz, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a crime of premeditated multiple murder for profit.
During the investigation, it was discovered that a 23-year-old man owed a larger amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to pay his debt, so he lured his creditor into a factory in Oz last Wednesday, where he killed a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the young man prepared for the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon at the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are being investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion CZK - was offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100% stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side even though the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the range of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99 percent of the shares are held by the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the offer from the Poles is the highest amount ever offered to a bidder for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, bids have so far been submitted by the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse.
Last week, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all the prospective owners, and he did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5 to 10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25%, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5%.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European paper
In their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers already recall "the second 9/11".
The global financial disaster is due to the US president, the accusation of the Roman La Repubblica, who has not been able to even rally his own party to support the hastily paid bill to remedy this desperate situation.
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, which reminded billionaire investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about a second 9/11.
Also, part of the Madrid press sees a culprit in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and the world will eventually pay for it.
While Bush's plan was not perfect, there is a danger that after a vote in Congress, Washington will not offer a political tool to resolve the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual governments can still throw a lifeline at the bankrupt financial institutions and taxpayers can save them from failure.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither the money nor the improvisation will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move beyond their national egoism and unite their control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the compliant monetary institutions received more than 100 billion euros, notes Der Standard of Vienna, which warns that fears are growing that European taxpayers will have to dig deep to solve the crisis, as the Americans have.
The European Union is facing a crisis that has been sweeping the old continent like a tsunami for as long as it has been.
The "saviors" may not be waving hundreds of billions of euros at once, but they would do well to be firm about when it is wise to use taxpayers' money to avoid even greater damage.
A smart car mimics the flight of a bumblebee
What better way to develop technology to prevent collisions than to mimic obstacle detectors found in the natural world?
For example, in bees.
The initial strategic idea for a surprising project, presented at the CEATEC trade fair in Japan, was inspired by the Nissan bees, and it was to build a new generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has designed a BR23C-type biomimetic robotic steering system, a robotic mini-car that is equipped with bee characteristics, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is actually very similar to our safety protective cover", explained Kazuhiro Doi, the brand's general manager of technology PR and research and development.
An important factor is the folded eyes that allow bees to see in all directions at a viewing angle of over 300 degrees.
To mimic the function of the compound eye, engineers have come up with the idea of a laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 metres in front of BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an anti-collision operation.
The obstacle is detected in a fraction of a second, and then the robotic car starts mimicking the bee's movements and by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid a collision, it instantly changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this escape maneuver is performed in a completely instinctive manner.
"If it weren't, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, because this technology fits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety shield, within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process has to reflect what the bee is doing to avoid other bees.
This process should not take more than a blink of an eye.
But unlike bees, this movement cannot be upward, downward, or transversely oriented, but can only be two-dimensional and only in a direction that allows the wheels to rotate.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees for avoiding, the robotic car has only the option of rotating, accelerating and decelerating.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifetime than lithium-ion variants.
Ando says that what's important is instinctive, intelligent response, not processing ability, let alone data storage.
This mechanism shall only process and respond to a few incoming signals per second.
It doesn't need to store them and react using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it only uses a few kilobytes of memory at a time.
It doesn't need gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step towards developing an instantaneous avoidance technology that Nissan estimates could be in mass-produced cars within 10 years.
Another application could be to connect the unit to a GPS satellite navigation system, which would guide the motorist to the specified final destination after avoiding obstacles in the road.
Damn dear baby already has a name
The bill for a $700 billion bailout package to be split into several installments to buy back subprime loans from banks is now in writing.
Half the money will be used in the first round.
After further talks that ended after midnight on Saturday, congressional officials reached an agreement in a days-long debate on a $700 billion bailout, Reuters reported.
"We've made significant progress", announced Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, who said the only thing left to do is to draft a deal.
The compromise package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Commenting on the outcome of the compromise, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said: "The program will work and be effective, but more needs to be done".
The written package was released before the Asian markets opened at 8pm Washington time on Sunday (or 2am Central European time on Monday), but did not trigger any major stock market rally.
The bill, the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which is to establish the program, will be voted on Monday by the House of Representatives and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and news of the deal was welcomed by the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made last night and highly appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program, by the way, differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which was to spend $700 billion at once to buy back subprime mortgage-backed securities.
Now, the first round of spending is now limited to half the $700 billion, so that $250 billion will be spent immediately after Congress is expected to decide on Monday, and the Treasury will use it to buy mortgage-backed securities that are rated as subprime, and the fate of the remaining $100 billion will then be up to the president.
The program will be overseen by a special committee, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Spending the second half of the $700 billion will depend on what Congress decides next.
The Ministry of Finance may, in accordance with the law, use a combination of tactics: it may simultaneously buy back sub-prime loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, or other 'toxic' loans.
The buy-back can be done through auctions or directly, the ministry said.
The legal provision will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme whereby the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee of funds giving cause for concern, for which the company will pay a price corresponding to the amount of expected losses.
As Henry Paulson said, the act provides the means to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it be to buy up large amounts of bad assets, insure them, or prevent the systemic risk of a major financial institution collapsing.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed", he added.
Instead, bankers who are in trouble and waiting for government help can expect a government reduction in their severance pay - simply called a "golden parachute" in overseas slang.
The reduction in their salaries will only be in certain cases and will depend on the type of aid provided by the Ministry.
The restriction essentially means that if the department buys at auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on the gold parachutes unless the fallen bank directors are sent straight to retirement.
In the case of a direct buy-back of substandard loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that management money is not overspent.
It should be added that the existing Golden Falls contracts will not be changed, the restriction only applies to new contracts, which is intended to be a further incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first time in American history that there will be a legal limit on CEO compensation", commented House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, a Democrat.
Moreover, the State will be entitled to a share in the participating banks, reducing the risk to taxpayers, as once the economy and the rescued bank are back on their feet, they can also profit from the transaction.
The plan calls for the president to submit to Congress a bill within five years to determine how taxpayers can recoup expected losses in the financial sector.
There were, of course, voices on both sides of the debate about the plan.
"This is not what the American people asked us to do, because this is not going to protect taxpayer dollars", said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes the passage of the provision was pushed by the very people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in industry increased by 0,1% in August 2008 compared to the previous month and by 12,9% compared to August 2007, the Central Statistical Office reported.

Domestic sales prices in manufacturing also increased slightly, by 0.1%, compared to July.
The largest price increases were in August 2008 in the leather and footwear sector (2,8%) mainly due to the month-on-month price increases in the manufacturing of leather goods and silk products by 4,6% and footwear by 2,5% respectively.
The higher price level of plastics and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly price increase in the chemical materials and products production sector (1,6 per cent).
Prices fell in the oil processing sector (1.4%), electrical machinery and equipment manufacturing (0.9%), as well as - to a lesser extent - in the woodworking sector (0.1%).
Prices in the papermaking and publishing and printing sectors remained unchanged.
In the other manufacturing sectors, we have seen price increases in the range of 0.2 to 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas and water generation and distribution sector, which has a large share of domestic industrial sales, prices increased by 0.3% in August, mainly due to the continuation of the officially agreed increase in gas prices since 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic sales in the individual manufacturing sectors, prices increased most in the professional oil processing sector (32.4%).
The metalworking sector saw a price increase of 13.2%, while the food, beverage and tobacco sectors, which are the most important, saw an increase of 11%.
Prices decreased in the textile and textile products industry (2.5%) and electrical machinery and equipment industry (0.3%).
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price growth ranged between 0,6% and 9,1%.
Overall, manufacturing prices rose by 10.2% over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water generation and distribution sectors were 18.7% above the previous year.
In terms of breakdown by sector, domestic sales showed the highest monthly price increase (0.7%) in August in the sectors concerned by the production of tangible assets.
Prices in the consumer goods sector increased by 0.3%, while prices in the energy and further processing sectors remained unchanged on the previous month.
The largest price increases compared to the same month of the previous year were observed in August 2008 in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16,8%).
In the consumer goods sectors, we saw a 6.8% increase in prices, while in the tangible assets sector, we saw a 1.4% decrease.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in HUF increased by 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, decreasing by 3.9% on a 12-month basis.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7% against the euro, then by 7.1% against the dollar in one month, rising by 7.5% against the euro and 15.9% against the dollar in August 2007.
Going to the United States next year without a visa?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is high hope that the US-Hungary visa-free travel agreement will enter into force around January 12, the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago to the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her view, "almost everything now depends on the timely establishment of an electronic system of authorisation and controls overseas".
It also pointed out that the new system would not include an entry permit, but that tourists would have to register before leaving.
The Hungarian diplomat is resuming negotiations in Washington today.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will be awarded the Medal of the Order of the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of a bailout of the banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major parties, on Sunday unanimously pledged their support for the government's $700 billion bank bailout, but there are also politicians calling for the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
After a marathon of days of congressional and administration negotiations, it was announced early Sunday morning that a basic agreement had been reached on a bank bailout.
A financial package designed to re-melt the Wall Street crisis and freeze the credit market has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are unanimous in their claim to be the more suitable of the two candidates to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, as economic issues have come to the fore, Obama has regained some of the edge and erased McCain's lead after the Republican convention in nominating Sarah Palin for vice president.
Obama expressed hope at a rally in Detroit on Sunday that the $700 billion package would be passed quickly by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages on consumer protection which he also supported.
"We must act immediately, responsibly... your jobs, your savings, your entire industry, the stability of your entire economy are at risk", he told a crowd of 35,000.
He didn't miss an opportunity to call McCain's ideas of economics obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained: "It's going to be a little bit of a drag on everybody . . . but doing nothing is just not the way".
As the Republican senator pointed out, the proposal includes the creation of a committee to oversee the Secretary of the Treasury and the limitation of severance pay for top officials, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role in the negotiations, but that he was in daily contact with the secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Overview of the German-language press
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - so analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haider family is ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Spiegel
In the online edition of a left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Father".
According to a prominent political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
For decades, Christian Socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria - and now these very modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
The change of seasons is a problem for all Christian democracies, including Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Saturday a process that could have been predicted for almost exactly ten years ended: the undisputed hegemony of one state ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU fell to 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s that it had fallen below the 50 percent mark.
This happened three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005, during the period of Stoiber's reign.
The reason is the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that is eating away at its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong in the pace, but the secularization, the educational outcomes, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria, could not have been without consequences for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is associated with increased opportunities, which also has visible political consequences.
The right wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also clear that in recent weeks the most distant from CSU have been the classical classes of citizens; the self-employed, the professionals, the graduates and the people with higher education.
That's already dropped CSU support below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who, with whom?
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BÖ seems open to any negotiations, the Greens are not yet willing to agree on a coalition.
The election is behind us, now it's all about the coalition; in the debate on public television, the party leaders didn't let their cards fall.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is certainly possible - in some Länder and in social partnerships it exists.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice chancellor.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer rate was reversed for every drop.
Repeating this direction is out of the question.
Molterer was cautious about the red offers.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins a coalition is completely open in the party, these issues must be discussed decisively within the ÖVP.
BZÖ chairman Jörg Haider once again appeared open to all directions.
"To prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to take the government's responsibility", Haider said.
Járóková: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equality, hosted this year by France, the current EU Presidency, opened today in Paris.
Lívia Járóková, MEP for the European People's Party for Fidesz, as one of the main speakers in the expert negotiations, drew attention in her message to the plenary to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
The Summit was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, on behalf of the French Presidency.
The negotiations were attended by invited representatives of governments, the European social partners, the most important European rights organisations and civil society organisations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz MEPs' group, Járóková pointed out that apart from discrimination in recruitment, Roma are being pushed out of the European labour market mainly because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education and, due to the poor quality of primary education, only a small proportion of them can achieve higher education".
Járóková also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a key role to play in the exercise of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the better his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes, they contribute to the national budget.
'The Roma have a right to their citizenship in the European Union, and the right to quality education must be guaranteed and their under-quality and segregated education eliminated,' stressed Lívia Járóková.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
'The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunities afforded by a democratic space so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe,' she demanded.
The European Year of Equal Opportunities is a guarantee to everyone that the European Summit for Equality, which has been held annually since its last meeting in Berlin, will provide a separate forum to help achieve the equality and non-discrimination objectives set at both European and national level.
CSU: temporary amnesty
The fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided by the end of October .
Despite the shameful election debacle, no heads have fallen yet, the debate on personal issues has been postponed by the top Bavarian CSU.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and the country's prime minister Günther Beckstein can still stay in their seats, the question is how long this mercy will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17 percent vote loss, will be decided at the party's special congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized duo have made it clear that they will not cling to their positions with all their might.
They tried to calm the angry members of the faction and the base who, because of the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" to draw personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the height of his career - the Christian Social Union won 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has only 43.4 percent.
The CSU was the "self-government" in Bavaria, producing 18 percent of German GDP for 46 years.
The Conservatives still have a strong position in the southern state, which is crucial to Hungary's economy, but in the future they will be forced into a coalition.
One of the first signs of the reorganisation within the party is the fact that the deputy chairman and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber, will be a member of the narrow intelligence team that will begin probing the Munich government's possible coalition with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Voters.
Ironically, the Free Voters' candidate in the House of Representatives was Gabriele Pauli, whose speech against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out the coup, but then a ruthlessly short trial with an ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on stabilizing Beckstein.
Stoiber, who has been spinning the thread in the background, will also play an active role in the transition period.
On Monday, Huber made some scathing remarks about the CDU, saying they deserved much more support from their sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless the CSU, which played a major role in the national success in 2005, is able to get back on its feet.
Merkel, who has found it difficult to hide her disappointment over the fiasco, said the loss of CSU positions would not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
This is of course relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD achieved its weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6 percent.
Lukashenko: the opposition - 110: 0
No opposition MPs were elected to the Belarusian parliament in Sunday's election.
Russian observers say this is due to the prosperity and stability of the country under Alexander Lukashenko, but the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) says it is due to irregularities in the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10-million-strong country has been without an opposition for more than a decade, the opposition group, known as the United Democratic Forces (ODS), had been hoping before yesterday's election that Lukashenko, who had been re-elected for a fourth term in a controversial 2006 constitutional change, would "allow" several opposition lawmakers to appear in parliament.
The ODS has also abandoned a boycott that was considered earlier.
The background to the opposition's expectation was that Belarus, which was increasingly economically dependent on Russia - taking out loans to mitigate the impact of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas imports and helping to get Beltransgaz, the owner of the country's gas pipeline, into Russian hands - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians are not allowed to enter because of the Belarusian political establishment, which is seen as anti-democratic.
The release previously pointed out that the OSCE's evaluation of the election campaign emphasised positive developments rather than shortcomings - for example, the ban on one third of opposition candidates running.
The OSCE's blitz report on Monday, however, already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates were essentially barred from appearing in the press, especially the fact that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
At the same time, the opposition says there is still a sense of improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to engage in smaller confrontations with Moscow as it continues to refuse to recognize Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms a union state on paper, has considered the two territories independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that a dialogue has started between Belarus and the EU", Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to an opposition presidential candidate in the 2006 elections, it is desirable that this should remain the case, even though "the government is afraid to let a single opposition member into a small parliament".
In view of the results, the opposition is not planning a protest, but rather trying to convey to the voters its message of the need for economic reforms.
"We have a lot of problems with this, of course, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, distribution is hindered by local authorities, but I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly", Milinkevich said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security as its greatest achievement, does not consider the right or officially most supported class of pensioners.
"With the country's debt and growing trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security 'silent graveyard' collapses", Milinkevich says.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers rated the election as democratic.
The head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, Sergei Lebedev, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti that "people do not believe in words, but in deeds", so the absence of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
It's the first time in the history of Chigi Palace that a revolving door has been introduced for employees to enter and leave.
But starting today, this new policy will work against crazed people, against people who get their needles in and then go for coffee during work hours.
The new anti-lazyman policy was announced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
"Flip-doors", says Brunetta , are a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services", the minister explains.
"A new era of accountability and transparency is now opening.
It is reformism", Brunetta stresses.
We'll finish the implementation of the Council Presidency in all buildings through Chigi Palace.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no objection from the employees, the Secretary-General assures: 'It was a common procedure with the workers and the cooperation of all.'
In short, no more breakfast during work hours; no more coffee and croissants.
Brunetta smiles and says, "nothing like a good cappuccino at seven in the morning".
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister finally announces that in three months, the absence of public employees due to illness has decreased by 50%, which means 60,000 more people a year at work".
He adds that it is necessary to make the Italian public administration more efficient
"its pay dynamics  explains the Minister  have doubled in the last 8-10 years compared to the private sector and are much higher than the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of public servants have rallied to reject Brunett's decree, in line with a request backed by Codacons.
"As the Minister of Public Administration today presents figures on reduced sickness absence  writes the Consumer Protection Association  the nation of 'active lazy' is growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and honest public servants who have come together to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree".
The main objections in Tara will be the exclusion of sickness allowance surcharges, which depend on activity; the extension of the time during which the patient can be examined, the time frame within which the examination visits will be carried out, and other norms included in the new ministerial regulations.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a report on the impact of the accident on the environment.
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, three people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
The Inail figures confirm that in 2007 we have about 1,200 deaths from work-related accidents.
These figures indicate the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains a leading cause of death, causing almost twice as many deaths as homicide.
To re-awaken the attention of the institutions, the social and the media to this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating the 58th National Day of Victims of Work Accidents on the second Sunday of October in all Italian regions.
"The alarming data published by Anmil and the tragic news of the last few days confirm the importance of the issue of occupational safety", says President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in a message to the President of Anmil, the National Association for the Handicapped and Disabled at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his deep admiration for the continuous joint efforts to ensure safety at work, to protect injured workers, to assist the families of the victims and to engage public opinion.'
"Naturally, an outraged 'enough' has been raised, honestly shared in the face of tragedies whose scale is causing a media and public outcry, but everyday reality again presents us with dramatic cases, even recurring in their dynamics".
Napolitano makes it clear that 'there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: investing in training and information is crucial.
The number of initiatives promoted in the field of education to give young people a clearer picture of the world of work is particularly important.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up on its worrying social importance, and to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed that 'the phenomenon of death as a result of an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social situation, an insult to the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to bring this situation to an end.'
"As far as the data on accidents at work are concerned, they seem to show some positive developments, but this does not deny that the number of deaths from accidents at work is alarming", remarked again Anmilu President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not want this 'reduction effort' to lead to less attention, because the moment attention stops, tragedy will break out.
"We believe that generally too little is being done to stop the problem of accidents and that there are many activities that can contribute to this problem.
We believe it is necessary to increase controls and inspections, but also to step up training of workers from school age.'
"There is still more work to be done", he added, "in terms of communication and public participation.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon which is an exceptional social phenomenon . . ".
Finally, Mr Mercandelli said that the level of entitlement to compensation for victims of work was progressively deteriorating and that the system had 'displaced supportive care' in recent years.
"The aim is to restore the workers' insurance guarantee", he added, "because the fate of those who are injured must not depend on spontaneity or the occasional gift of the legislator".
MP3 players accused of endangering hearing
Long-term exposure to loud music and the use of portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a European Commission notice published today, which in an official report circulated in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Recently Emerged and Identified Health Risks (Csrseri) Eu.
"From this scientific opinion  we read in the notes  it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music with portable musical instruments for at least five years, for more than an hour a week and keep the instrument at a high volume, are at risk of permanent hearing loss".
"I am concerned that so many young people who frequently use portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high sound levels may unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way", admits Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings  continue  show a clear risk and a need for rapid response.
The most important thing is that we need to engage the consumer and make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding to make them fully effective and keep pace with new technology".
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to look into this problem in view of the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
'The scientists  concluded the EU Executive  confirm that there is cause for concern and now the European Commission will examine, together with other Member States and concerned parties, what measures could possibly be put in place to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise caused by portable musical instruments and similar devices.'
A European safety standard already exists to limit the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concerns are growing about hearing damage that can be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly reduce this damage by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
The Scientific Committee of the Eu believes that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (above 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to the maximum permissible noise level in the workplace.
Those exposed to music for long periods of time in such conditions risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem is expected to affect 5-10% of users of such devices and can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany leaves the Commission free to decide on the future of the capital.
We'll start today, close in March, have the money in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the commission will draw up a manual for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the city council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Campidoglio and its councillor Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas  it wants to emphasise Alemanno  it will have to ensure that proposals for the development of Rome are finally used by the political arbiters who remain Giunta e Municipal Council.
It's not a function exchange, but just a bid to have a place to work on a big project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and then dissolved, because this institution must have a precise deadline.
In June  the Mayor announces  we will present a strategic plan and build on the work done by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome".
To those who accuse the Commission of being superfluous because its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: 'It all depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, as the proposals of the Attali Commission are, and I am sure they will be in Rome, their contribution will be decisive.
Too often politics is fragmented into everyday problems and urgencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
The mayor of Rome also wants to emphasise that "this Commission is neither a useless enterprise nor a bluff: it is completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro and it will serve to think and engage the best intelligence the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, "a strategic plan must be the starting point, neither definitive nor fixed, to allow our city to rise authentically to the level it urgently needs and to think with a united spirit about its future".
A future which, the Mayor of Rome explains, "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries but will look much further" not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital, but "also includes the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president.
A prominent U.S. president wrote that it was important to him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the next anti-American president".
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US economy with his decisions and maintained relations (as a private citizen today) with the enemy Islam".
Attacks on Obama are escalating as the election date approaches.
A woman in Miami wrote on the Web site: "This man is ambitious.
Obama has the nerve to think he's going to the highest office in a nation that's had two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they're clearly racially motivated attacks that don't answer the voter's question: Will he be a good president? And then we have the polls; everyone says Obama will win and by a wide margin.
Again, there are those who follow their hearts rather than their brains.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the heart of the southern United States, commented: "At least once in the ballot box, we know exactly who an American patriot will vote for.
It's going to bring out a side of the American mentality that was hidden until the last minute.
Say what you want, and we'll take care of it ourselves, whether it's Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, and it seems almost certain that a black candidate will succeed.
But despite all these considerations, the main weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people what mistakes Bush made during his tenure, and 89 percent said Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became a weakness for most of Bush.
Whoever takes the place of Georgie W will have a huge task to perform.
The economic collapse of the United States has been felt by journalists, as the newspapers are in a period of investigation, and many blame the Internet, the killer of the press.
The Pew Research Center asked 500 journalists about the state of their profession and their predictions for the future.
Well, today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, respondents did not openly say that they had less concerns about credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a broken economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put together the paper, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists interviewed, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we are not to see a fundamental change in traditional journalism as it is understood by the general public.
American journalism is permeated by a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten print journalists and senior executives believe that journalism is going the wrong way nationally.
In the local area, the executive team is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for a journalist to see where the web is going.
The major publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many view as the "killer" of print.
The "economic pressure" that journalists are pointing out has increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred journalists interviewed admitted that they resort to technology in the hope that it will "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms -- that is, executives -- and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level, the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with job security for someone.
The national rate of managers who think they're going to lose their jobs in three years is 47%.
As for the journalists, they're moving to 30%.
As for the "sure work" of the staff in America is still the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work on contract.
In a nation as vast as the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV, and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and so it is a take-it-or-leave-it question.
Executives are almost always paid huge salaries, and the editor can earn as much as ten thousand dollars a month, not including pension and insurance.
As regards holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year until 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often fall ill within a year.
It's just a matter of climate.
The trial in Rome, Daniel Coppola, is in progress in Grottaferrata.
The president of the second criminal chamber of the Roman court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who asked to be moved from his hometown, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with a counter-offer to sell Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial, at his own expense, he was released last week from house arrest, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, have asked that the real estate entrepreneur be allowed to move his residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (which the PM has spoken out against) would allow him to influence his company and gain access to the evidence that accuses him.
The Elites in Danger
This phenomenon was already evident a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout plan put forward by the White House: a large part of the American people were more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times report that the current crisis is dividing the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old soul on the East Coast, more moderate, friendly to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is conservative, hostile to those in Washington and the financial world, strong especially in the Midwest and the South.
A soul that has shown itself arrogantly by voting, as I mentioned at the beginning.
But this thing that I just quoted is just one example of the changes, the big changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not just in the United States, but all over the West and maybe not just here.
In both the US and Europe, this crisis seems to be acting as an accelerator for phenomena that have been in incubation for a long time, that are solidifying in a new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the reactivation, the extraordinary revival of the market, the dual category of State power in relation to a certain re-nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions, which of course have strong links abroad, but which are mainly concerned with the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
Which also created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families, which are voters, among others.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be largely out of the picture or to have little to offer: the European Union, which is as always divided between different interests and different national strategies and unable to decide on a common political line, has given clear evidence.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual country, the bailouts, the market revival, the new rules and, most importantly, the allocation of funds: the moment we get into a crisis, only countries have the economic means, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to fix things.
And they also have the necessary means and the authority to use them: two sources of immense value, in certain circumstances, which perhaps no market or international organisation will ever be able to use to a similar extent.
This new emphasis on the national element, which the crisis places on the national dimension, is in line with the increasing emphasis on the one factor closely linked to recent economic progress: territorial integrity.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the realm of the sieve, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to rule the world, out of nowhere we realized that our future would instead have to contend more and more with such few immaterial things as water, grain, oil.
All things, who would have said, can be moved from one place on earth to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to a limited space, a territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler has a lot more cards up his sleeve than whoever isn't and who has the misfortune of living in a place with no grain, no oil and no water.
I'm getting to the second news item, but it predicts a breakdown.
When you talk about territory, state, government, you're inevitably talking about politics, which is leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be emerging.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, a request for someone who can take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, there is a wave of discrediting of existing leadership, especially economic leadership, which has proven equally inadequate and full of dark spots.
And together with that something even deeper and somewhat disturbing: the discredit, the impatience, the sense of incompetence and absence that is trying to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
For it seems that there is a growing belief among the broad masses of the population that their actions are not the same as the ideas of the up to now popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite are out of date and indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply feeds off a branch from the underground, but a powerful movement to remove the ruling classes and the traditional political order is manifested in sudden electoral "resistances" or unexpected shifts in collective mood in recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the fall of Labour in Britain to the uprising of US Congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, some would say their format, are having increasing problems understanding, that is, representing, what, not today, is being created in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is intensifying again, growing, potentially too dumb.
Before this, it would be too much to talk of a permanent "mass uprising".
But we can't say that it means keeping our eyes open.
Super glue for walking on walls
Overcome the laws of gravity with super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes is getting very close to it.
Scientists have managed to keep a 100-pound body glued to a vertical wall with a sticker just one inch [2.5 cm] square.
The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, the University of Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material that the research team has invented is an evolution of existing materials that use a special structure of carbon called a carbon dwarf tube.
"The glue base can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers were inspired by the gecko's legs, which are covered in microscopic hairs that allow the animal to achieve perfect adhesion.
Tests on materials such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper showed that the new glue is ten times stronger than the reptiles' legs and "just sticks off the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a temporary glue", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe walking on walls like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers are thinking of a far less fascinating use as a connection to electrical devices, because dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in aerospace engineering .
No superheroes at this time.
OTHER RESEARCH  The University of California, Berkeley, is also researching a new glue.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, California scientists described a glue made of microfibers like hair that cleans itself of dust by moving across a surface to maintain a perfect fit.
Medicines: never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medications, their consumption changes the potency or decreases the potency with serious health consequences.
To highlight the dangers of juices, both fresh and finished, when combined with certain medications, David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, is sounding a new alarm at the 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: One glass of grapefruit, orange, and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some lifesaving drugs, negate their beneficial effects, and put patients at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing the effects of some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine, and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
THE MEDICALS AT RISK The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in a newsletter two years ago, urging doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to be careful about what they drink when taking drugs, such as Diazepam or Methadone.
Not only grapefruit  Experts say that orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress drugs.
A long list of effects of grapefruit and other juice.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department at the State University of Milan: "Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which may arrange and exchange information manuals for medicines.
So always read the package leaflet of any medicine you buy, and if you find anything unclear, do not worry but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification", stressed an expert for Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in economics is going to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activity.
Krugman is a 55-year-old New Yorker who teaches at Princeton University and who is a well-known editor for The New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration's foreign, economic and political moves.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days of Enron's collapse, Krugman predicted in a commentary in the New York Times that the second event would be far more important than the first in terms of its impact on the history of the United States.
A prediction that has caused much controversy and been blamed for years, but has proved to be accurate.
"I'm surprised and shocked at how quickly collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from the public eye", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenz Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is "an economist of great importance" but also a popularizer who has "a very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush administration's liberal policies".
Open Office, we have the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package here.
Today is the release of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal production suite that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the more popular Microsoft Office.
After about a year of work by volunteers, controlled by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is being presented to the general public with various new features: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window are complemented by other, far more substantial features, such as compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
The emphasis is also on cooperation with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open a document with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Some models have special features, such as the ability to reduce the size of a PowerPoint presentation, for example, for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer a PDF file to a graphical design model and maintain the original appearance of the page.
Still from this perspective, we can create "hybrid PDF" documents that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have the characteristics of a spreadsheet or word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in excel it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program each collaborator is assigned one color to the comments to be more clearly identified in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on bringing some of the Open Office features to the web, and they should be able to present a final result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, and has been added to the English version available on Mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace on request.
And if the topic of free of charge can be a catalyst for expansion in the home, it is the commercial area of Open Office that the package is very much focused on, and it can already count on a variety of projects being implemented in public administration and schools.
There is also a range of training, consultancy and assistance services ideal for SMEs, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are now almost at 3.600 thousand, with the release of the new version, it is possible that this projected number may even be exceeded.
Kohl's test is positive, too. This is his fourth doping case.
New positive case on the last Tour de France: it's the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third place and winner of the best climber shirt.
The report was quoted by the pages of the daily L'Equipe.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth driver to test positive for Cero, the third-generation Epo, after Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli from Italy and Stefan Schumacher from Germany, also from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples are consistent with those taken in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabra.
If the controls confirm the positive for Cer, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and face two years of disqualification.
The report of Kohl's positive for third-generation EPO was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French anti-doping agency, who told the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government authorities of the result.
The 26-year-old Austrian took the podium behind Spain's Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, and won the best climber's jersey.
The New York Times asks, is Italy racist?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only at the last house become the first destination of immigrants" received with reluctance.
So asks a long article in the New York Times, which focused on the debate over racism in Italy, starting with the case of a young man named Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case illustrates what the New York Times calls the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are also where "more integration and more work" is recorded, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support for the Northern League".
To confirm the rising tensions between Italy and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just that.
Legislation demanded by the Legislature to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
A trend highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedict XVI in the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students who are victims of expensive rent - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for college students is not in crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, a rental union, a student can rent a single room for up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that entire classes of students have lost their right to study because of the overall high prices their families would have to bear  explains Laura Mariani, head of Sunia's study office  in this city, high demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it has triggered a process of price increases that have spread to residents".
In most cases, the lease offers contain several infringements: free-standing, unregistered, unlimited lease, associated sub-leases.
For Sunji, an exceptional intervention is needed that could regulate prices through tax reform.
If we look at the details of the research, we see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, the cost per bed is around 450 euros, with a single room ranging from a minimum of 650 (in the Bande Nere area) to a median of 800 (in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera areas) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350-400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the university, a bed in a double room costs 250/280 euros, while a bed in a single room costs between 370 and 500 euros.
In Rome, in the central university areas (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), they want around 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double.
The figures are slightly lower (EUR 550 for a single bed) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
The only way to save is to move to the outskirts: 300 euros per bed and 450 euros for a single room in the Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples, beds cost between 300 and 450 euros, rooms between 400 and 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, they want 250-350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the citizens' economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is renting for students from outside the European Union, another anomaly is finally being noted: an increase of around 25-30% in the fees they charge for international students, compared to Italian ones.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso Cinema, the cities are tearing down historic theaters
The historic movie theaters are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without a cinema is like a blind man, like a face without eyes".
The image, presented by director Giuseppe Tornator, successfully documents what is happening in the big Italian urban centres as well as in the rural towns.
The process of curbing cinemas, the birth of large multi-screen cinemas in the suburbs and the subsequent demise of monastic halls in the central areas of cities is one of those events that seems inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the hallmarks of a true cultural crime.
Often, historical sites are lost, full of memories, "it's like losing a friend, a friend with whom we shared a journey and a lot of emotions", says the director of the New Paradiso Cinema, a film that won the Tornador Oscar and the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes 20 years ago, and which told the poetry of a village cinema and the grief of a way of life that cinema has probably lost forever.
The figures obtained by Anec, the main operator association, speak for themselves: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed their doors, with the highest bills paid mainly by theatres in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures, Emilia-Romagna was the first with 82 cinema losses, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the rise of multiplexes is primarily responsible for their disappearance is that these three Italian regions have the highest number of new multiplexes: 195 more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 more in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
The Italian process has developed irrationally says Paolo Protti, president of Aneca, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones survive, because when one cinema in a city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to a multiplex.
Let us not even talk about the lack of funding for the fund for operators: the previous state debt is around EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical standpoint, it is a shame that the government does not respect the existing laws.
The sector would need between EUR 16 and 18 million a year to support it.
The case of Bologna is interesting, the first Italian city to have concerns about closures and to have decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the municipality and Aneca, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in the historic centre and in the suburbs.
The planned standards include tax relief measures in favour of operators and mobility benefits for the public: spectators will be able to drive into restricted traffic zones and will have special prices at stops and in some parking lots.
I like this initiative says Giuseppe Tornatore"and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by introducing other measures.
But what is certain is that in order to counter the great power of multiplex, traditional theaters must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
Defending traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: closing the Super Cinema in Bagheriya, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to start the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk past the Rialto or the Quirinal on Rue Nazionale, which are now closed, where I've shared so much emotion that I don't have to look at the black and dusted signs, I turn the other way.
Link between politics and the 'ndrangheta mafia, Mayor Gioia Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to manipulate the municipal election to suit the interests of the Piromalli mafia group".
The charges brought by the Directorate for the fight against the Mafia in Calabria against the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the Mayor of Rosario Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external collaboration with the Mafia organization, are heavy.
Also in the handcuffs are Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the boss's namesake, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia nature, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense", prosecutors wrote when two local governments expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with Piromalli's lawyer.
"This would allow the mafia group to enter the city's official administration and facilitate the already enormous possibilities of control and management of the public administration".
Agazio Loiero, president of the Calabria Regional Commission, makes it clear that "there are many secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld in his region: "There are areas where the mafia is more concentrated than in others, where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'ndranghet, heroes who are still untouched".
This morning's arrests follow the arrests of last July, which police said showed that Piromalli's mafia group had been given a final blow.
Since the end of April last year - the Gioii Tauro city council was dissolved in 1991 due to the then-presumed link between organized crime and the local administration - local politicians have been removed from municipal office.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of the dissolution was elected head of the centre-right coalition after a narrow election in May.
He was shouting about the scandal when the prefecture ordered the city council dissolved.
He called in then-Deputy Interior Minister Marc Minniti and accused him of plotting the whole thing for political reasons, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that the mafia group even went so far as to request a change to the A3 highway project.
Further interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, the prosecutor writes, revealed "a willingness to shift the claims of a businessman, a representative of a larger group very close, as is commonly known, to Piromalli and to adapt the elections of the public administration to the interests of the mafia group".
When energy is born from waves, the big ones come into play.
It's an endless deposit that covers over 70% of the Earth's surface and is now being discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy, which have caught the eye of giants like Chevron, which is now trying to get their hands on them.
The possibility of generating energy from the sea has been studied for over a century, and research intensified in the 1970s in the wake of the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil dropped around 1980, the idea of using offshore power went away, but now environmental organizations and the new increase in oil prices have given the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that about 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by harnessing the movement of the waves.
This amount would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear power plants.
And then there's the currents and the tides and the tides.
The giants are attacking.
The company that invested in offshore energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this plan was announced, it seemed like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of investing in marine energy, more and more companies are investing in marine energy over traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology", a spokesman for a company linked to the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and they're considering working with us".
The cooperation we're considering involves obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to get a marine energy project up and running in Alaska.
This signal cannot be underestimated, especially when you consider that Alaska is where the U.S. continues to drill for oil and recently President Bush came up with a plan to drill again.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are also following the offshore energy trail, and the amounts invested so far, although not known in detail, are showing increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology that needs to be developed.
Experts say the technology is still in its infancy because the environmental impact of using marine energy is unknown.
So far, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small and do not appear to be causing major problems for the ecosystem.
However, to produce more energy, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater environmental impact.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boats that are interconnected.
The wave force that moves the buoys up and down is converted by the cylinders and cylinders into hydraulic pressure inside the buoys.
It's pushing the turbine, which feeds the power to the generator.
Power is being brought to shore by undersea cables.
So far, four of these devices are in the design phase, pending federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
In contrast, Verdant Power is already generating power for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six offshore turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water during high tide causes turbines to spin, which in turn feeds the generator.
Verdant said they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorizations to use this energy.
Waves, tides and waves.
The potential for tidal activity is of particular interest at this time, says the Electric Power Research Institute.
Although they are not related, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
In fact, states like New York, Maine, and Alaska, along with other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in tidal energy in 2008 and are forecasting up to $35 million in 2009.
