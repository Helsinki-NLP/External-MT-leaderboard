That's why I left the PDP.
Former Federal Assembly Speaker Yakubu Dogara has explained some of the reasons why he left the PDP to join the APC.
It is not to be forgotten that the former Federal President, Yakubu Dogara, has left the PDP and returned to the APC this week.
Dogara said that he had been suffering the abuse of the PDP governor Bala in Bauchi State that helped him win the 2019 elections, so he decided to leave the party and return to the APC.
The main reason I left Kiwa is the way PDP is in power in Bauchi state.
Everyone knows my role in the election of the governor of the state whose former minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed defeated the incumbent governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now I am a waste of money and a burden on Bala's government.
Instead of staying in PDP and getting what I deserve I should avoid them, go back to where I came from.
Dogara wrote a letter of resignation from the PDP which he sent to the party's president of his constituency, Bogoro C, in Bauchi state.
He concluded that as he has always pointed out to other governors where they failed and where they should improve in the past, he and Bala are not anointed and anointed.

APC accuses Neja Governor of attempting to bring down the party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement released by the APC this Tuesday, the party accused Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of trying to stir up unrest within the party.
The document, signed by the President of the Engineers Party Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary of the Barista Party Muhammed Liman, stated that, in the six years of the party's rule in the state, it has only received 512 million Naira.
The document further said that the meeting called by the governor of stakeholders, which he chaired on the night of last Sunday weekend, will help to continue the unrest in the party, saying that they have written to the party's national secretariat about the developments in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "we understand the Governor of Niger State is trying to divide the heads of the party by organizing a stakeholder meeting, which is illegal, because any complaint against the party leaders, in writing to the party secretariat is shia, for them to investigate".
He further said that so far in the six years of the party's existence, 512 million naira is in the party's account.
He said that what he understood as a governor was being in the national ad hoc committee formed on July 25, 2020, which was headed by the president to lead the resolution of the issues between the party members and withdraw the complaints in court among the party members.
With the money we receive we pay the salaries of the party secretariat, and other services related to the party, the election campaign and the settlement of other party members' problems such as health benefits due to lack of access to government subsidies, not any party funds we have spent illegally, we challenge or object to the accusation of corruption of party funds.
As I explained, the last local government elections were the most important elections ever held in this country which we held with the former commissioners and the commissioners who are currently in power in all 25 local government areas in the state, whose money spent on elections was distributed to the commissioners to bring their votes.
Therefore, it is wrong for any person to say that party funds are spent illegally, this is almost unfair and an attempt to protect the bad reputation of the party is an attempt to hang it, saying that there is no committee to investigate how the party funds are spent and who founded it.
Among the sums claimed by the complainant were allegedly misappropriated funds, funds provided by the National Party Secretariat, no other funds of any kind and I challenge anyone on this matter to bring his testimony to support this allegation of his in any way.
Imam said that we stand firm in protecting the APC from any attempt by any person or group to dismantle the party, adding that any criticism of the party or any party leader from the state level will be written to the party's governing committee as per the party constitution as stated in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) on page 82 of the party constitution.
Thus the party's stakeholders have no role to play especially if they try to usurp the power of the committee and their decisions have no effect.
For this reason, they are the only legitimate party leaders recognized in the state, in article 21 and paragraph six of page 87 of the party constitution, anything contrary to this shall not be invoked.
Because the judgement of the people and the leaders of the people are wrong.
He said, those who submitted the letter with approval at the unprecedented meeting yesterday, which was chaired by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, as well as Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, were not members of the party's executive committee in the state.
The steering committee of the water and sanitation party will be headed by the party leader, Engineer Mohammed Imam, and not by the governor who will head the state party leadership.
The document further said that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promise made to the people of the state during the election, and the movement of the party leaders in the government so that everyone in the state and all districts would benefit by giving political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The document commended the federal legislators for not attending the meeting and called for a mediation of all the problems between party members, which is not surprising for the legislators who know their own pain, to reject the dictatorship as a party law.
Therefore, it is necessary for the chairman of the National Standing Committee to draw the attention of the Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the need to refrain from attempting to overthrow the state's politics.

The impact of food waste on the health of people in Nigeria.
Some scientists have warned against eating foods that contain antioxidants because of the health risks associated with them.
Experts issued this warning after conducting a study on the quality of food in the country.
The results suggest that some foods are being fortified with chemicals to prevent spoilage.
The study also found that the chemical was used extensively in the production of corn, alabaster flour, and dried fish that were sold to the general public.
The purpose of the poison was to arouse the curiosity of the spectator.
Eating foods that contain this chemical can cause cancer, kidney disease, heart attack and more.
The people of the country were urged to be careful in avoiding the consumption of these types of foods for their health.
Not to mention food safety expert Grace Olasumbo has called on Nigerians to avoid eating tree products that have been processed with Calcium Carbide.
Olasumbo explained that Calcium Carbide is the most commonly used chemical by retailers to process raw wood products, i.e. vegetables.
Research suggests that the ability to tolerate and control the flow of the water is one of the factors that make the market prefer this chemical because it can produce a significant amount of water in a day.
Olasumbo explained that one of the marketing failures was the use of this ingredient to promote the health risks of the product.
As a result, it can cause diseases such as diarrhea, vomiting, eye infections, stomach ulcers, throat, mouth, liver and other ailments.

The head of the African Development Bank is cleared of charges - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
A panel of experts led by former Irish Prime Minister Mary Robinson has cleared the head of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Akinwumi Adesina.
According to the committee Mr Akinwumi Adesina is not guilty of the bribery charges against him.
AFP news agency reported that earlier this year a fifteen-page report accused Mr. Adesina, 60, of bigotry, incompetent leadership and self-enrichment.
But a panel of experts led by Robinson, along with Gambia's Attorney General Hassan Jallow and World Bank's Deputy Governor for Ethics Leonard McCarthy, cleared the former Nigerian Minister of Agriculture of all charges.
The United States had previously insisted that Mr Adesina be investigated on the allegations, following his ouster by the AfDB's board of directors, which led to the formation of a panel of experts to conduct the investigation into the fraud.

COVID-19 has disrupted Trump's Florida campaign.
On Thursday, US President Donald Trump announced that he had canceled the Republican ticketing convention scheduled to be held in Jacksonville, Florida, next month, due to the surge in coronavirus infections.
However, the convention program in North Carolina would be held.
Trump said in Jacksonville that holding a rally was not appropriate at this time.
President Trump moved part of the GOP convention to Florida last month after a disagreement with Democratic leaders in North Carolina over holding the meeting in a closed meeting room with his supporters without wearing face masks.
A small group of Republican delegates will gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, to officially elect Trump on August 24.
Trump said he would deliver the inaugural address in a different format.

China Achieves its Economic Growth with Food
Food is the life-breath of all living things, and they cannot live without food.
That is why Chinese authorities are increasingly focused on ensuring the country's food supply.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved remarkable achievements in food security that have shocked the world considering the country's population which is estimated to be over 1.4 billion Chinese.
This effort helped make China a major contributor to the eradication of world hunger, as the head of the China Grain and Agricultural Products Agency Zhang Wufeng once said that since 1949 until now, China has always put the issue of hunger reduction at the forefront of all its domestic affairs.
But recently, some people and some Western media have again "worried" about whether China can raise its own population in the shadow of the COVID-19 global respiratory virus outbreak.
We are grateful to them because they have always taken care of the Chinese presence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has achieved food security through self-sufficient efforts.
The issue of providing Chinese people with enough food is one of the top priorities of the ruling JKS party.
Last weekend, the General Secretary of the JKS Central Committee, then President of China, Xi Jinping issued a significant directive to stop food waste, pointing out that everyone knows that every food particle is a hard work.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 respiratory disease pandemic is also taking a toll on China's economy, China is able to produce enough food for its population.
The latest figures released by the China Statistics Agency on the country's agricultural production, especially rice, for the year 2020 show that the country's rice production in the first quarter of 2020 was 27.29 million tons, an increase of 1.08 million tons, or 3.9% compared to the same period in 2019.
He also Ke Bingsheng, former president of the Chinese Agricultural University, said that China has made great achievements in terms of the country's food supply compared to the early period of implementation of the policy of reforming domestically and opening the door to overseas.
Huang Jikun, director of the Chinese Agricultural Policy Research Center of Peking University, stated in an interview with the correspondent of "The China Science Daily", that the biggest challenge China is facing now is in the next 2 or 3 years, whether China can reduce the amount of wheat and rice stored in its grain storage.
The average annual per capita grain yield has now risen to 1,400 pounds [474 kg] instead of the normal of 1,400 pounds [400 kg] for the rest of the world.
And now China is importing millions of tons of other agricultural products just for raising livestock.
Therefore, those who express concern should relax, bathe and go to sleep, or concentrate on domestic matters.
The Chinese were able to feed themselves with food they produced.

'Northern Media Writers' contribution to the North Side.
Modern social media such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others, have long played a role in providing forums for discussion, collaboration and friendship among different global communities, with the exchange of messages, stories, and dissemination of political, educational and business ideas.
Young people in Nigeria have embraced this new technology by using social media, to keep up with the times, and to contribute or share their thoughts on new issues that affect their lives.
We can say that these elections have brought us many advancements that the youth of the North are benefiting from in the business, economic, educational and political spheres of the region.
Many others have made a living by posting and posting on the Internet, have found jobs or have developed their businesses.
It is a pity to see how some young people instead of using this opportunity to benefit from the progress made, are found following the deformed children of the south who are famous in the world for corrupting the public, inside and outside the country, or writing obscene and abusive articles against judges and politicians.
It shows a lack of progress in the development of the youth of the country.
The arrival of the Arewa Media Writers in this country is a great blessing, to provide the youth of the North with a good direction and to refine the activities of young people in Social Media, so that they can write meaningful articles and spread the ideals of the Northern community.
It is imperative that we give this organization the necessary support, in order to achieve its benevolent goals, which will bring benefits not only to our Northern region, but also to Nigeria as a whole.
I would like to advise our youth, especially social media users to come together to protect the dignity and freedom of the North, and to create a system that will bring change for all.

It is reported that late anti-oppression and poverty advocate, Malam Aminu Kano, once said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
So we say, surely as we call for the development of the country and the improvement of governance, at every level, we call for the unity of the people of the North, without discrimination of religion or ethnicity, to bring our region forward.
Considering how the North was then, it is not so today.
We should therefore use our God-given talents to make contributions and suggestions, to provide the North with a satisfactory path to economic recovery.
The North should provide revenue streams to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to waste money.
In addition to the development of the North, we attach importance to education, agriculture, tourism, healthcare and science and technology.
Money is not always a means to give, and there are many ways to give.
We think that this is how the North will fulfill our fathers' desires!
The North is our pride.
We can do so by considering how the Bible writers were used.

The punishment for rape in Nigeria is not the best - the owners.

Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje announced this in his interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, adding that, as long as the authorities confirm this after investigation, the death penalty is the only solution.
He added that the decision will reduce the number of rape cases that can be solved, but the main solution is to change our hearts.

Farmers in Benin are expecting harvest and crops in the fields - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Rice farmers in Benin State expect to reap a high yield as much as two months after planting.
Some of them who were lined up in Makurdi expressed the hope that the harvest would be anytime between October and November.
A small farmer in Mbatiab-Gboko township, Titus Atondo, said he planted rice in a two-hectare area in July.
Atondo said he sourced seeds from a market in his area and they were in two batches of CP and OC rice as he used Dazzle chemical to clear the soil for planting and fertilizing.
According to Titus Atondo, the challenge of growing rice in rural areas such as the mines is more difficult because we rely heavily on labour as the customers do not have access to the farm roads.
Titus Atondo added that we are hiring people to do the farming from the ground level to the harvest, adding that this is tiring and it is a lot.
Atondo said that the total expenditure on his farm which is currently underway includes planting, clearing, fertilisation and their expected harvest is N2020,000.
Titus Atondo went on to say, however, that he expected at least 50 bags of buhu as the harvest from two acres that would probably sell for 29,000 naira per 100k bag.
Another major rice farmer, Bitalis Tarnongu, planted in June to July on 274 hectares of land which cost N14.500 per hectare while the ground floor cost N25,000 per hectare.
He planted 44 varieties (Supi) and Faro 61 (OC) seeds derived from the National Organic Council (seeds) and some originated from Olam Nigeria.
He added that the growth stages at this time are in different phases while some are in the process of breeding, and some are in the first stage of killing animals as the crop is grown in stages.
Tarnongu added that the challenges so far include financial ones as the cost of producing livestock is high and the cost of labour has risen.
The harvest is expected to begin in October or November.
He added that the total price of raw materials by the end of the day would be a minimum of N246,000 per acre while the production is expected to be three tons of honey which could translate to N360,000 at a cost of N120 per kilo.
Tarnongu does not use pesticides on his rice fields, instead, he recommends and practices traditional farming, adding that, therefore, we use highly pesticide plants, pesticides and fertilizers.
The President of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) Benue State Branch, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, expressed hope that the rainy season this year will be suitable for the large-scale rice cultivation.
According to the President of the National Association of Farmers (AFAN) for Benue State, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, more farmers have entered the rice growing business by the end of this year due to the coronavirus pandemic which has prevented many people from leaving offices and staying in their fields.
He said, this year it will harvest 20 percent of the 2019 production which is estimated to be over one million tons.
According to him, the data collectors are currently taking statistics of various types of farmers and when the process is completed, the number of rice farmers in the state will be determined.
The head of the Benue State branch of the National Farmers' Association (AFAN), Comrade Aondongu Saaku who said he has planted three hectares of rice fields, noted that some farmers planted rice in June while those who are short-term farmers do so just in time for the expected harvest in late November or early December.
AFAN chief added that rice farmers are using chemical pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and insecticides.
He expressed his concern about the challenges of animals threatening rice production, adding that farmers are building fences, installing ropes and clearing the edges of the fields to address the problem.

The music-filled film by singer Beyonce, "Black is King", continues to receive praise and criticism around the world for its portrayal of African culture.
In South Africa, where the 85-minute "Photo-Drama" was released, many commented that it was "the best movie ever made".
Black is King is a musical film directed, edited and produced by American singer-songwriter Beyonce.
The film was released in the United States on June 6, 1938.
The film was shot in the United States, South and West Africa, and Europe, and featured several African musicians.
The film, released in July, received a warm reception from audiences, but there were also some critics.
Others say that Beyonce, who was born in Houston, Texas, USA, illegally borrowed African material, especially the African-themed images in the film, which in practice has no cultural roots in the African continent.

While praising the media, the ministry said these heroes are fellow travellers who must join forces for success.
She said, "I want to assure you today that your work is worthwhile".
She also said that she was not proud of her achievements, but she and her colleagues are ready to continue their work in the spirit of sacrifice and commitment to fulfill their mission, which coincides with their one year anniversary theme, Service2Humanity.
The Minister paid special tribute to "humanitarian workers and our partners in this sector from UN agencies such as OCHA, IOM, UNHCR and UNHCR, World Food Programme, World Bank, USAID and European Union (EU), and other partner agencies who continue to provide humanitarian assistance despite the ongoing insecurity and hardships they face.
It also included those who died in unsafe areas in the past year.
The ministry explained that the one year anniversary of the creation of the ministry has forced them to be very tough.
She said, "As we celebrate our first anniversary, I would like to say that it is time to take a fresh look at our work".
We must find ways to expand disaster management, relief efforts and social support channels that will help us to improve our work in the future.

Just as the Nigerian crop is about to be harvested, farmers in the Sokoto State are struggling to cope with the threat of birds, which could hamper the expected harvest.
The threat of blackbirds in the Sokoto area is becoming more and more serious, as the 2020 season is shaping up to be a good one.
At the bottom, some local farmers adopted a traditional method of driving the birds away as described by a young man named Faruk from the Dange Shuni area.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the farmers in the area, said the birds are now eating all the plants they first find in the fields.
The head of the Nigerian Farmers Union branch of Sokoto State, Murtala Gagado Minannata, said that two-thirds of Sokoto state is now facing this problem.
He also said they are now waiting to hear the status of the local government areas in the state so that they can compile a report to send to the state and federal agriculture departments to take action to help farmers.
Federal Agriculture Ministry official in charge of the department of aviculture and insecticide, Ya'u Ma∆ôeri Kagara, said that the spraying of avicide in the Sokoto area was completed less than a month ago.
He added that the birds are imported from the Republic of Niger and Benin, and international trade must have an agreement before the issue can be resolved.
In June the federal government launched a bird-killing campaign in 12 northern states of Nigeria that border the countries through which birds enter Nigeria.
But the re-emergence of this problem could set back the clock from the apparent progress in the agricultural sector which governments claim to give special attention to.

New COVID-19 Relief Bill to be introduced in the US.
As the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States continues to rise, Republicans in the Senate are expected to introduce a health care bill on Monday.
The aid is expected to reach $1 trillion to ease the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the country.

There is a need for people to know the 2019 Code of Conduct - KCSF Group.
The Kano Civil Society Forum (KCSF), a coalition of civil society groups in Kano State, in collaboration with the EU, the British Council, and the Rule of Law and Anti-corruption (Rolac) law enforcement group, has launched a campaign to raise awareness on the 2019 Criminal Procedure Code.
The event, which took place at the Aminu Kano Institute for Democracy and Extension Research in Mumbai, looked at the new laws and how they are administered to the community, which was organized by 150 Kano-based civil society organizations and journalists.
Speaking at the event, the keynote speaker, Dr. Nuhu Musa Idris, of the Faculty of Law at Bayero University in Kano, referred to some of the more complex laws.
There he called for a review of some of the outdated laws as a result of the legal proceedings of the Age.
In his speech, the head of Kano State Civil Societies Federation (KCSF) Ibrahim Wayya, said ignorance of the laws played a major role in the violation of the community's rights and that there is a need to know their status.
Some participants of the conference, which is the third of its kind to be organized, in three Senatorial districts of Kano, from civil society groups expressed their views on the bill and its message.

The New Law on Registration of Religious Places in Nigeria is being debated.
The human rights and economic development group SERAP has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to reprimand Nigerian Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami and the Director General of the Registration Board to stop the process of registering places of worship.
According to SERAP this action is a violation of human rights as enshrined in the constitution of Nigeria.
Before human rights groups complained about the government's action, various religious leaders had already lodged their grievances with the Buhari government, demanding that the bill be sent back to the Congress for review and approval, so that it does not violate the constitutional freedom of religion and belief.
Pastor John Buro, a Christian leader in Kaduna state, told VOA that the law is baseless and unjustifiable, especially if the government is trying to restrict or impose restrictions on worship.
He should simply be able to use the available means by monitoring and prosecuting all offenders without introducing a new law.
Meanwhile, Dr Bashir Yankuzo, the dean of Minna University of Science, said that while it is not a crime for the government to monitor companies and organizations for national security, it does not mean that it is strictly forbidden to infringe on the rights of any individual or group.
It remains to be seen whether the government will listen to the people's cry.

How the Akure University of Technology (FUTA) attempted to take down the PREMIUM TIMES website.
Akure University of Technology (FUTA) sponsored a hacker attack on the website of PREMIUM TIMES, the leading online newspaper in Nigeria.
This giant of the Internet has tried all the hacking techniques to get into the websites of people, but he has not succeeded.
He began experimenting with hacking on February 28, where he planted his malicious tools on the campus of the university, and continued his attacks using the university's "data".
On the other hand if he tries to hack the PREMIUM TIMES hard drive with a computer, then he commits another attack with his GSM phone.
He spent five days trying to hack the main portal of PREMIUM TIMES, but was unsuccessful, despite using various advanced technology tools.
He was unsuccessful in breaking in, because the university was unaware that PREMIUM TIMES had a copy of the plan, which built the wall and the gateway that a burglar was not strong enough to break through.
PREMIUM also has its own dedicated security officers for its state-of-the-art Web Archives including PREMIUM TIMES War Chief and PREMIUM TIMES Chief Security Officer, Web Shield.
These security officers with modern skills to crush any gang of thugs or any bards who try to go it alone, or to martyr-money to try to break into PREMIUM TIMES Database.
The following types of weapons were used by the hacker to attack PREMIUM TIMES:
At 8 a.m. he began sliding the door of the PREMIUM TIMES Museum, hoping to see how he could break in, completely demolishing the museum.
If he failed that night, the next morning, at 6:15 a.m. he tried again, this time by using "WPScan", which is used to detect the strength or weakness of the security measures of large Internet sites such as PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes, he started to break through with the power of modern computer technology, "custom script".
In the morning he tried his best to hack the computer and shut down the PREMIUM TIMES website completely.
How the Farmer Deals With the Bears:
The hacker did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had made a deal to stop the small and large companies that were entering the social media landscape from closing the site or taking over the social media site.
This ignorance of his made all the weapons he used, completely obsolete weapons that could not harm PREMIUM TIMES.
On that day he suffered a futile and exhausting attack by DDOS on the Likau Rural Police, which is an old road that has been used since Kano village.
On March 3, he tried every last trick in his mind, but it all came to nothing.
This attempt to break the door of the PREMIUM TIMES Main Archives came just days after PREMIUM TIMES published the story of the alleged collision between President Muhammadu Buhari's National Security Advisor, Babagana Monguno and the former Chief of Staff of the Presidential Palace, the late Abba Kyari.
Some within the Federal University of Technology, Akure, have told PREMIUM TIMES that the university has hired some hackers to attack, corrupt or destroy the PREMIUM TIMES Main Archive.
However, PREMIUM TIMES contacted FUTA University, which has denied the attempts to attack PREMIUM TIMES's Internet Archive.
FUTA said unless a college student who is a bachelor makes an effort alone, FUTA is not a good idea.

Governor Abdullahi Ganduje wants the Kano State Assembly to amend the state law of 2019, to confirm the appointment of two senior Kano princes who were resigned by the late King Ado Bayero and King Sanusi, so that the state law will confirm their appointment as the chief regents in Kano.

In Longyuan Village of Hongsipu District of Wuzhong City, Ningxia province of the Hui Autonomous Region, located in the northwest of China.
There was a brave woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Muslim name) who became famous for her struggles in life and her successful efforts to break out of the poverty.
Her story tells us that, effort and commitment and self-seeking, are things that are in the heart.
Initially, neither Li Yaomei nor Sadiya had ever sat in a classroom for the purpose of taking lessons, which meant that she could not read or write.
But God gave her a gift of wisdom, intelligence, and a great wisdom, so that she became a model in the field of warfare and poverty.
About 20 years ago, Mrs. Li Yaomei, suffered from stomach cancer, which led to her undergoing three operations.
After a terrible accident, she was walking with metal in her ankles.
These challenges have put her in a difficult situation not only with her health, but also with the issue of medical bills, for which she received a loan of about 300,000 yuan, equivalent to over 16 million Naira.
Ironically, this challenge faced by Ms. Sadiya became a means of smearing and defaming her in order to improve her life.

Considering the challenges that Ms. Sadiya has faced, and the ongoing efforts she is making to improve her life and that of her staff, it is understandable that the seeker must be the one to get.
The fight against poverty and social progress is not the only concern of the government.
If the government provides support, but people lack the drive or the desire to improve their living standards by finding jobs on their own terms, then only a backward life will be pursued without any real purpose.

There are fears that US politicians will corrupt efforts to curb COVID-19
Recently, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed concern about the actions of some countries to save COVID-19 vaccines that are expected to be produced, stating that the vaccine distribution must avoid discrimination against different countries.
And the dose should be distributed in a fair manner across the globe, as this would suit the gross national product of different countries.
Indeed some US politicians are pursuing a policy of self-interested bias in vaccine distribution, as well as undermining international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide has already exceeded 23 million.
Among them were more than 800,000 people who died from the disease.
Under such a critical situation, there is an increasing focus on the efficacy of vaccines, and the good news is that in recent times, there have been significant results in vaccine trials in several countries, which has provided hope and confidence to the international community.
But sadly, some US politicians have expressed interest in getting the vaccine.
Science magazine even revealed that the US government has already signed contracts for COVID-19 vaccines worth over $6 billion from several pharmaceutical companies.
Although, the US government's policy is understood, as the US is the country with the highest prevalence of the disease, other developing countries also need vaccines, given that they are suffering from a shortage of health resources.
The magazine "The Ecologist" also pointed out that if the US achieves the goal of producing enough vaccines, the amount of vaccine production in developing countries will be reduced.
Kaza Liqa, the director general of the Centre for Disease Control in Africa CDC Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern over the issue.
As some commentators on current affairs have pointed out, even if a vaccine is successfully developed, it is not possible to achieve the goal of post-pandemic surveillance, unless the distribution of the vaccine is planned, which is a matter of great international importance.
And it is appropriate for the world to further strengthen its cooperation with other countries.
WHO Director-General Tedros also noted that the pandemic must be contained from all angles globally, as it is not possible for some parts of the world, or even a few countries, to achieve recovery from the impact of the pandemic on their own.

The Buhari administration was appalled by the funeral procession of Abba Kyari in court.
A Nigerian activist has attacked all the members of President Muhammadu Buhari's administration who attended the funeral of Abba Kyari.
Kyari, who was the Chief of Staff of the Presidential Palace, was laid to rest at Gudu Cemetery in Abuja, on April 18, after his death due to the Coronavirus.
The plaintiff, Tope Akinyade, lodged them at the Court of Appeal in Kado, Abuja, where he sought a court sentence against them, for breaching the federal quarantine law in force at the time.
He said there was a great injustice for Nigerians who were repeatedly arrested and punished during mandatory house arrest, but for other groups of people who broke the law, none of them were punished.
He said that if the Buhari administration is screaming for justice, he does not see why the common man should be arrested if he violates the Corona law.
Other government agencies have broken the law but have been tolerated.
Among those sued by Tope, were the Federal Secretary of State, Boss Mustapha, the Minister of Transport, Hadi Sirika, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, the Minister of Relief and Relief Affairs, Sadiya Umar.
There is also the Press Spokesperson of the Presidential Palace, Garba Shehu, the social media officer, Bashir Ahmed, President Buhari's Advisor on Security Affairs, Babagana Monguno, Inspector General of the Police, Mohammed Adamu and many other government officials.
Justice Celestine Odo sought to show that the plaintiff was in error since the defendants did not sign the complaint form he had filed.
However, Tope reminded the Judge that he had filed the case directly in court, not through the police.
He said it was the judge's duty to send all the accused with a summons to sign.
Because he did what the Nigerian law gave him the right to file a case in court.
The judge adjourned the hearing of the case, ordering a further hearing on August 4.

South African President expresses dismay at the insistence on contracts.
The South African president has expressed his regret over the rampant corruption in the country's ruling ANC party.
Cyril Ramaphosa, in a letter dated Sunday 23 August, sent to all members of the ANC, began by raising the issue of the controversial provision of contracts to help the country fight the coronavirus.
The reason for the crisis was that there were private companies and individuals, including government officials who took advantage of the crisis in the health, social and economic sectors for their own benefit, according to the letter.
This deception is inexcusable for millions of South Africans who are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, facing daily hunger, and unemployment.
In the letter Ramaphosa also wrote that millions of dollars of the country's money were identified to be used to improve the transportation sector, provide basic infrastructure for the poor, and better electricity, to help the black farmers emerge and develop the whole country, which the criminals stole into their pockets.
President Ramaphosa said that people should not think that the ANC is a means to gain power, wealth and prestige.

Nigeria is experiencing the worst economic recession this year.
Published on: 24/08/2020 - 16:33.
The Nigerian Bureau of Statistics announced that the country's economy has experienced its worst recession in 10 years, a result of a decline of more than 6 percent seen between April and June this year.
Figures released by the Agency today show that between April and June, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the suspension of daily operations, the Nigerian economy entered a period of unprecedented growth between 2010 and 2020.
The agency listed the reasons behind the crisis as including mandatory lockdown across the country, restrictions on transportation, air travel bans, and closure of schools and businesses.
The agency added that the international response has caused the oil price to plummet, while the international industry has shut down to deal with the crisis.
Last May, Nigeria's Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed said the Census Bureau had predicted a similar situation, as the result of these problems prevented the day-to-day running of the country, forcing the government to withdraw its budget.

Nigerian Minister for Development of Niger Delta Region, Godswill Akpabio has revealed the names of the legislators who were awarded contracts by the NDDC to carry out some major projects.
This comes at a time when the leadership of the Niger Delta Regional Development Commission NDDC is accused of embezzling the funds.
Among the names of the legislators who received the contracts was the chairman of the Senate Committee on the Niger Delta Region, Peter Nwabaoshi who received a list of 53 contracts as announced by Minister Akpabio.
Mr Akpabio also said that Senator Mathew Urhoghide signed six contracts, Senator James Manager also received six contracts, while former Senator Samuel Anyanwu received 19.

Yobe Spends Over N78.8m to Restore and Leda Company - Leadership Hausa Newspapers
The efforts of the Yobe state government, under Governor Mala Buni, to revive the state-owned plastic bags and sacks company (Yobe state Polythene Bag and Woben sacks Company), after more than 10 years of shutdown have been lauded.
This was stated by the company's General Manager, Engineer Sha'aibu Adamu Gadaka, in his conversation with our representative at his office in Damaturu, the capital of Yobe State, earlier this week.
He said the company had been closed for over 10 years, but after the arrival of Governor Buni it was hard to make a decision to revive it, who immediately ordered a withdrawal of N78.8 million to repair the vital parts of the company with an additional N48 million to manage it, while allowing the company to get on its feet.
Gadaka further explained that this allowed them to purchase the necessary equipment to start the company, which included a new 500 KbA generator, 500 KbA transformer, new leather-cutting machine, bag sewing machine and other equipment required by the company.
He then added, "Until today, the main objective of the initiative of Governor Buni, to revive this industry is to provide jobs for the youth, while reducing poverty and providing income to Yobe State".
According to Gadaka.
On the other hand, he said the company has won the favor of the state government, due to the state government's revival of the Yobe Flour and Feed Mill in Potiskum and other businesses that sell the company's products.
He said the state government's efforts to reform the fertilizer plant was also a step towards purchasing the company's products.
