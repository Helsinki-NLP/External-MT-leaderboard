The rest of the UKIP who refuse to accept those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS shouldn't be used to pay for those who come to the UK for health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he says yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirable.
First you use special arguments, then you discredit them with a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to line up behind chronic hypochondriac intolerants who think they owe it all to themselves.
I think you're the one using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing lunatics, is virtually non-existent.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So nobody would be affected by UKIP's measures against health tourism, so there's no problem.
It is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a torch is not proof.
Yeah, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail didn't write the report, it just commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity either, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence surprised many, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to get over it.
I'm not sure where you're coming from, but I guess you don't like it when the media talks about what you don't like.
We talk about it so seldom because unlike Farage and his crazy Thatcherite followers who think AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, so they don't.
Finally, the situation in Ireland is as bad as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming, the austerity period will not fix anything.
Hoping for almost 5 percent growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland was the 'TIGER OF EUROPE' we were touting a few years ago.
We've seen the aftermath!
That's a good start to the article.
It is attempted to make Ireland a virtuous country and a 'new economic miracle' is taking place.
The Brussels agreement, taxes on Europe's lowest companies, a very flexible labour market, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients, there's no 'packing' for now with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 1980s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal being a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was ahead.
Their development has not been a long, quiet river, but it is clear from recent developments.
The lowest tax rates in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If one believes a report published in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France overall.
Only SMEs pay full price.
Now I confirm that road traffic has gone up again, and there are new cars (and waiting) on every street corner, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I've been living in Dublin for 14 years, and the recovery is evident in the daily traffic jams since I got home.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will be burning soon.
In another article they're writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a crash on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary is about to buy a whole new fleet of aircraft, so a few bumps and scratches on the old ones will be forgotten soon.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it's not on either of those two once you're fucked.
Then it would be the other pilot's fault entirely.
Did Ryanair charge the passengers an extra fee for the additional fear we were willing to provide them with?
But without these kinds of Irish businesses, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I've never taken a Ryanair and the last three times I took a plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can take pleasure in it.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic fare have to take care of themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error by the airport air traffic controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they're not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome to this British Airways flight that's taking the British ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a good trip .
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrianised, and literally crowded with people.
People do not come in large numbers for the quality of the restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the magazine show at the White-Mantel Space (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for the crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With many foreigners spending .....
Do you think Sunday's opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sundays, full of people with 50% tourists.
@aloes False!
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and is nuanced by the fact that they buy in detail.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of turnover every year for the same reasons.
It is still the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, can bring down prices.
Sunday rest is a right of employees, except for exceptions.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs have any competence to reform the Labour Code.
While they're locking it up.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and businesses that want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sundays I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my town of 30,000 people where I live in France the municipal library is open four days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
And that's also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended firmly against fascism
the way of life he defended firmly against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was used against her will to pay the estate costs?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are not terrible.
I'm sure his successor would like his share of the pie, if you'll pass the phrase.
His preference for a victory for the nationalists/Francos in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
I'm not too happy about it.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he opposed other aristocrats of the government who wanted to discuss a deal with the Nazis and he very cleverly won.
With his splendid rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium, and ultimately the whole world, can thank God for having had Churchill at the helm for these five years, just these five years and no one else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
If his descendants sold the paintings on the open market to raise money for the estate, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to see one in a museum, they should raise the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was the time of truth, Churchill's personality was a positive asset to his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, since infrastructure projects are by definition not renewable.
The social reforms advocated by the Minister reflect the real problem of mistrust of dialogue.
Back to the princeps values.
The reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let not the weakest of us be in need!
Either we come to his aid in solidarity or he has a DIGITY in return for the services he provides or has provided at a minimum of resources.
My SM40H preference to smic is for this vision.
There's also the landlord who lives off his property income.
A distinction should be made between those who invest for a return at the time of retirement and those who live on their pensions.
One property to rent or even two for a couple on top is vice.
The little finance genius lacks a singular imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack of great infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so no new deal could be a solution.
The Commission has therefore decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used to finance the development of the Community's financial resources.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to reduce the climate and energy shocks in the future, then the need for investment is urgent: insulation, renovation of the railway network, urban transport, energy transport and storage, etc.
A tax that promotes high incomes and rents.
Who's in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles is a real galop.
Samsung's profits are being undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors in the same range
Apple's mid-September introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have attracted buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided to get the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I think it's essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft put this philosophy into practice, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have multiple dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by one manufacturer because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people don't value design, but they think the options, the functionality and the price are the most important.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for a better platform.
Is there a better car manufacturer, not really, they're different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches to different people and different markets.
It's healthier and needs encouragement.
That's in our interest.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our unfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, they are very much Parisian idiots) could tell us about which authors they fight ideas about gender and tell us which books they intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
So, what, is their source Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, John, I love you, and you're a smart, hardworking man.
I said that about Judith in Furusato's vein, referring to Holopherne, a similarity that I hadn't had (I don't have her liveliness of mind).
Otherwise, in the "background", since you refer to it, I'm not interested in this subject, and frankly I don't see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I'm slow but I understand...
@ Jean: recognize that culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne does.
Who 's afraid to ask the world ?
But what do you fear those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first one is about the Judith of the Bible, the second one is about Judith Butler being a very symbolic throat cutter.
We can see how much these studies affect the most intimate in their homes.
We are obviously no longer in the debate.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: As for a debate of ideas I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To claim to fight ideas from the only exposition of their critics (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But, as I was explaining to our unfronted friend, there's a big difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic throat cutter, I settled for the "Second Sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated for the disappointment of sometimes being blinded by clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, the cloud last night would really cover the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia was clear.
Special flash of the blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey holds the Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we'll give it its true colour as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with it, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne, so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself for the entire week of Perseid meteor shower and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm beginning to think there's a bad genius whose only goal is to keep the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn't see the eclipse because of clouds over the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
EVERYONE watching this eclipse should pay a TASS.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like your last before bed.
Who or what will obsess you when it 's finally gone ?
It seems you spent a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages where people criticized the Abbott government and then accused them of being obsessed with EUX.
It's a beautiful picture of the moon above the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth !
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the income inequality between labour and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
The ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments for these recommendations are not given.
No hyperlinks to the original documents so you can make an opinion.
Today, Tuesday 15 October, the results of the miracle recipes are available: in Spain, exports are at their lowest level in five years.
In Greece, the stock market is collapsing.
But these are the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of some EUR 8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy has assured us that these claims for compensation are not justified.
What if the Ministry of Economy makes a mistake?
Will the decision-makers who have gained the political benefit from the courageous attack of the notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The sequel in time.
Okay, thank you, JYL.
@lol The state is not comparable to households in terms of budget management because the state's time horizon is theoretically infinite while that of households is limited by the lifespan of its members.
In addition, unless they consider that public expenditure is unproductive, it helps to finance tangible and intangible investments, guarantees future growth and thus future revenue.
Some answers.
That's a regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of the world's pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first.
That's a nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth doesn't match your fantasy.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands tied by the law as written by the politicians.
This is the same situation as with the product that causes medical abortions instead of having risky surgeries, safe shoot rooms for drug addicts instead of having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money on drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Since the Liberals want our health care system to look like the United States, you should ask about how it works.
Doctors around the world are courted the same way, but it's more or less visible.
It may be wrong to blame the tobacco industry, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to corporate profits and research.
So read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the global prices of medicines everywhere, as well as the differences between countries on what is over the counter or prescription only.
It's reinforcing it's a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are already testing inhalation of marijuana for oncological pain, despite laws restricting it and expensive permits.
While some drug manufacturers may not be happy with alternatives such as marijuana, those who find a version that offers high-quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacy.
The hospital was a happy place until someone put a chip in the ear of a hospital manager.
You can't patent the grass...
If  social scientists were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, we could use their  work.
A researcher investigates, he doesn't compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
Comparing is teaching, not research.
You can't say  the research is done you have to apply  and then in the same jet  you have to experiment with everything going .
If your research is successful , why experiment ?
If your research is not successful, why do you wonder if we can apply it?
Can we explain how a researcher can infer that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could assimilate mathematics and other subjects more easily?
New technologies make it possible to learn if students learn to use new technologies, but how can they learn new technologies if they cannot learn?
Pisa tests are just an indicator. We make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that satisfy us.
What's the point of building an indicator that tells you what's good for you, a desire to promote yourself, a deception?
One way to train teachers is to keep sophists and ideologists out of training and practitioners from teaching practitioners.
If you read the paragraph on internships (which unfortunately is not very well argued) you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservatism:  It is a mechanism that leads primarily to the reproduction of existing practices, and which does not allow the system to progress 
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, practitioners alone cannot be expected to teach practitioners, even if they have their place in modern teacher training.
Education theorists should have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon with a purely theoretical background, who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems in the education system.
To give more weight to education theorists would be to destroy it forever.
Your analogy is totally flawed: if I do not wish to be operated on by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would much less wish to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the fly.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative MP in charge of fighting copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
Thank you, ex-MDR.
If one day I start to feel guilty about copyright infringement, I'll just read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
It is the same since they must cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license is free.
No, it's a copyright violation.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without proper license, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can always argue with pedantic assumptions - but it's stealing.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, but it won't be true.
It's a copyright violation.
Go on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about copyright infringement
Apparently you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should get paid for images used in homework, an almost perfect definition of what a reasonable use should be, then I'm happy to deprive them of that fictitious income.
Lesson number one should be to show how, if children themselves create something and post it on their favorite social networks, they abandon all intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions they have just clicked.
Maybe if they share their mp3 headphones with a buddy on the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in this way.
If we could export this resource we're so full of, the whimper that says everything's wrong...
If a member of the Socialist Party is saying that, then we must believe him.
I have two children, and when they are of choice, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continually assisting them.
I don't want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What's bringing France down is speeches like yours.
@gus I've always worked in a private company.
I have had the chance to work in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm an employee because I know I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the zero bosses I meet frequently.
I am comfortable in my shoes and I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he is telling the terrible truth!
@gus, if you compare with German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to call for reforms in France, in Germany companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by linking large companies to medium and small businesses - What do French bosses expect to do the same?
The state hold their hands?
The state they accuse of being unreasonable?
@ Jacques L.
Always that anti-business couplet from you!
Remember, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so strict?
@Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who are shrinking and shrinking while waiting for permanent State assistance!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: the abolition of the Labour Code, employers' duties, taxes, working 45 hours a week for 35 payers, and some, walking on eggshells, dare to demand the reduction of wages or their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the negative comments on this subject.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From where I'm coming from, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay afloat rather than transform.
That doesn't mean the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of them.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that.
I tried to get them recently, but I couldn't.
But the Labour Party is gonna be a pain in the ass, isn't it?
It's an international branch.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing stops people in the UK from setting up a more ethical business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems we're not very good at managing, most of our privatised services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all of it to finally get the decision overturned.
And there's something better: MTR, a Hong Kong-based company, won the Crossrail contract to operate for eight years.
Well, the Labour Party, as they repeated to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other across borders.
So we can assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Perhaps it is because the Dutch are on the right track whereas the British are not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a beating girl".
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
To assume that being "struggling" is a quality superior to many others, that caring about others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "struggling" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancer "struggling" who have died, I know of palliations.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start again.
I'm not saying it's the condition to manage, I'm saying it helps.
It's not about any merit!
When it comes to examples from your life, there's only you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
To suggest, even for a moment, that you can have merit in getting out of a disease or you can be demerited in not getting out is simply monstrous.
The body either follows or it doesn't.
A body that's loose, from everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
I'm sorry to think otherwise, but having a strong moral will probably make it easier to accept and prepare for heavy treatments, to try experimental treatments like this woman did, and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is a medical fighter is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if we'd rather go to the Lord, that's another matter.
Not with merit or courage.
These considerations are proper to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real dirt, you get stripped of your clothes to the point of becoming a zombie.
I personally caught two, dirt, fat, and if I "fought" as these psychologists call it, I completely missed it.
Unless this fight is just a grinding of teeth, hell-bent on getting beat up.
I thought the charges against Milosevic were decided and finalized about a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on? What's going on?
It's a birthday party.
It's a forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted  quickly  and then swept under the rug.
Is that the story we told back then?
The communist turned nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The communist president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
So please ask what we have left out of the plan: 1.
How could NATO bombing be legal under the rule of international law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
As for RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, it would be swallowed by the Western compressor.
The West used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally declared its independence and was quickly recognized by Western states who then lied end to end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first term because he could not understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we don't like him).
To my knowledge, only in Greece is a method of earthquake prediction working roughly, measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
One hope, but caution is to put this water in the water. It has nothing to do with the one of the exoplanets named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus, which would be the smallest and coldest planet to have detectable water molecules, according to a study by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine's team at the University of Maryland.
So, what method to follow?
Just like those involving animals feeling a threat coming.
Thank you, science graduate, for often feasting on these experimental feats that are being accomplished in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Perhaps by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas a priori odorless to man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable to man, but not to the measuring instruments at his disposal.
But we have no reliable results on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report about the struggle of two teams of scientists, one from California and the other from Japan, to recognize the validity of their work on animal sensitivity to earth's magnetic fields, and in particular their modification before an earthquake.
So I'm not a scientist, but their hypotheses convinced me!
Or are we on this research?
Why is there such contempt for this trail?
We should learn to listen to nature again.
If you examine things calmly and carefully, you'll get it published in a serious magazine, and no one will look down on it.
As soon as we talk about the signs animals give us, we'll all come across the same thing: everyone will remember that five minutes before an earthquake, the red fish was strangely circling.
I don't understand how we can think Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to LBC, you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and he's always trying to distract with a joke.
He never answers anything directly.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the host asked him what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to run for mayor, and he didn't keep one.
It just points out how much of the rest of the Conservative Party is a bunch of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in Have I Got News For You.
Because it's a celebrity and we've instilled in people the cult of celebrities.
Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the Tories' popularity rating will crack the ceiling I'm sure of.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be a joke.
That's exactly what they said about Londoners.
He should have brought his friend the parpaing, smarter than he.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have always been very disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For those who have given themselves the trouble to read a few books (there are some, including a French and excellent B.
Millot, the Solomon Islands and the Iron Strait speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, the Australia, must have been in the background since the Battle of Savo) did not want to return.
We have indeed passed Savo Island in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the ecological side is a total smoking.
Calculate the amount of kerosene consumed to achieve the goal totally discredits the concept.
You just have to go through the list of sponsors rather than philanthropists.
A further operation of com neither done nor done.
The cow, it makes me want too much!!!
Look forward to the web series!
Your story makes me think again, identifying me a little in the passage (I also learned to sail with the Crocos from Elorn to the White Mill on the Brest shore!).
The environmental message is also a welcome one, although some criticize the impact of the move.
The end justifies the means.
Keep making us see, and show with pride that the Bretons are great travelers!
Peter from Trinidad and Tobago.
I think the red hat who protested against the taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not spend a penny of our taxes to finance the dreams of even some adventurers as friendly as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation who are of Kosovar origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team
Bisevac is the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a midfielder or something in the 70s and 80s and coached a lot of teams in Greece, but I don't know where he's from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as a forward in the Velez senior team which, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, twice finished second in the Yugoslav league (and also had such figures as Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsene Wenger's loyal teammate Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
They said he was going to be a great player when he was at Juve, he's currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn.
I can't help you here.
I know he lost his seat when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not a starter.
Maybe he's still doing something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be scared.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone isn't the flag of the real Albania of today.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A little bit of exaggerated nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there wasn't too much damage (I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with a map not of what is called Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give parts of the country to neighboring countries.
How could one have felt "an explosion of joy" seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and no doubt children were inside?
How can you ???
What bothers me a little about this "testimony" is that the only fact that I could, even once, spontaneously rejoice in the horrible death of thousands of people is a sign to me of a "borderline" personality whose "testimony" should be taken with the utmost care.
Perhaps the brief moment of "joy" would not have given us thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
You'll just think, for a moment, that for once, some Muslims had succeeded in really and apocalyptically hurting the great evil Satan in his very heart.
To make something powerful.
It's great.
It seems that this sentiment has been shared by thousands of Muslims who are consumed by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
It's a classic Schadenfreude.
We had a little idea.
The "Christian/White/Gaulish" West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Musamman when it contemplates the general misery, social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Arab Muslim world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How do you get the Muslim world out of this evil tunnel?
In a phase, two major poisons are irrigating the Arab world: bigoted conservatism of the powers in place and fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the disfellowshipping (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
If we've understood this before, it shouldn't turn the Muslims back.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet, and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everybody gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes out, it's hell for me and for the likes of me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Fall is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in the fall.
Not as breathtaking as the summer green when everything is alive instead of dying.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, don't be such a grumpy, cliché-robbing guy!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now that I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to germs from outside, that could change, I suppose.
It's not about dying, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a feverishness that culminates in festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the dangers of snow and a lot of other wonderful words.
Just keep doing things!
Here's my recommendation for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark, gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child support , the amount collected by the State is essentially from decimal places 8 to 10.
However , as regards the number of households whose tax rates have increased as a result of this measure , it is above all Decisions 4 and 5 (median income) that are affected , as shown in Chart 2 .
The removal of half the share, especially for widows, is not addressed at all in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to settle.
Well, we're not on the straw, but we're dreamy.
For once the PS makes a rather leftist policy we won't cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let's keep doing this and you'll encourage those 20% to work or leave.
Well, I know it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the PS recycled trout and OCI: they understood everything.
Adam, you're not seeing what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from collecting as much as they can.
Over a certain limit money loses all its usefulness.
And once the use of money is gone, money is no longer used for making money, that is, to do the misfortune of the most people.
We're in the top 20 percent.
Perhaps also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, some of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax should allow these families to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or we could just as easily shake hands and live off social minimum standards, especially if we have social housing.
The utopias of the Khmer Rouge headhunters have, fortunately, survived.
I did two Airbnbs in Norway recently.
I'm not worried about that.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have in a five-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face any trouble.
You just go to someone's house, sleep in, pack up your car and go home.
From now on, it'll be my first choice when I'm traveling.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you'll need some kind of homeowner's insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six hours too late.
I like Airbnb.
 It's very dangerous and very risky  No, it's not true.
You just really missed out.
From the link in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he didn't get any support from Airbnb?
I love AirBNB, to receive and to travel
Hi, I'm looking for people who've used bnb air just to reassure me.
I'm thinking of paying a down payment and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid of sending £1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
 Supporting the troops , singing the Wounded Knee in every tone...
So they're harmless weapons.
I am sure it will be pleasing to the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends died from something other than Saddam Hussein's chemical bombings.
Unless the content of the article has been radically altered by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Moreover, how would this mass murder committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
The author's style is not very clear:
We're all in agreement.
You think it's time to weaken the military to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it always time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
We would have already strengthened education considerably if we had them working 35 hours instead of 17.
Our teachers currently earn more than engineers.
And let us not be led to believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But this is not apparent since the National Education has no means to provide an office at the college/high school to its teachers so they work at home.
Some form of forced telework, except that the employer pays for neither the computer, the internet connection nor supplies.
Besides, it's so much the 5 p.m. shift a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill out the maths CAPES, come on, we're waiting for you.
How can you not want to be a stalker of poorly educated birds whose parents spit on you calling you a troublemaker ?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Kurdish population can flourish better.
Where we see that the Bush administration has absolutely done everything wrong.
My first job was in sales in London, earning three times nothing, and yet it was a job that required a degree.
A year later, I saw an ad for a worker for the London Underground, it was paid an extra £5,000 a year and we didn't even apply for a patent.
I never regretted it.
Don't worry about that if you can't find a job with a high-level education. Try to find something that pays well or that you enjoy doing.
If I had stayed on my graduate job, I'd still be paying off my student loan.
I don't like business so much, so I hope to eventually move into either public service or academia.
LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year lag.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of such obscure fields as art/literature/theatre/media/philosophy/political sciences is what is known as unemployment degrees.
I have one of those degrees and I ended up as a production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
The starting salary was lower, but you're up the ladder quickly because in the real world, what matters is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate of engineering/artistic fields has been going on for years.
Scientists can't solve all problems, but it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in a way that produces results.
Are letters, philosophy and art two-way streams?
That's ridiculous.
I assume you're talking about degrees like media studies or whatever absconding industry you went to.
Literature, philosophy, political science and art are real fields.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of cultural fundamentals like literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn't it be better to have a real territorial policy to disburse Paris and energize the rest of France?
Personally, I cannot see the people of the low-lying areas of the Essonne and the Val d'Oise riding 80km every day on their bicycles to work in Paris.
Intra-muro and small-belt residents already have many otherwise more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as already exist in the northern European cities of Dijon and Lyon, will be installed on the road.
- That's a good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, the City of Paris is expected to work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
So much for their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we couldn't find a place for a single bike attachment.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not right at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other public transport users the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that drive super fast and don't care about the survival of bicycles 2/ we get a lot of pollution in our heads For me the cycle paths are a piss go, we have to reduce car traffic (urban toll type congestion load), reduce speed (Paris = zone 30), enforce the road code by systematically verbalizing (even bicycles at the presumption that we have to adapt the road code for cars 100 years ago), otherwise, generalised bicycles are not written in the area before the clocks, and after the cars do not pass through, and scooters do not generate the clutter.
The cycling routes to the east of apartheid must be cohabited but the occupation of urban areas must be rebalanced.
Nothing on the bike in Paris ?
Not a word about the bike seat on public transportation?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% of cycling is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
In addition, the EELV deputy seems skeptical of the report by the OR.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, we'd better find out who's really behind this massacre.
Clue: it's not Russia.
I'm not sure I like the way the world is changing.
It looks horrible.
My kids are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to take the case to the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they would have to first file a complaint in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not at fault, the fault lies with the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other planes had been shot down before, Ukraine was launching airstrikes against the rebels in the area and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to gamble with the lives of innocent people so that airlines pay the flight fees over the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurping government/Ultranationalists in western Ukraine - and who want to show broadly that Putin shot down flight MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 ruling by the International Court of Justice that the CIA's supply of weapons to the Contras' rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There's no way Russia won't let this case go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think Abbott is telling Putin that Australians have been murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to back up his claims.
So far, the investigators have said nothing of the sort.
It's so sad to be called Ricardo and be such an eco-beotian.
To be called Polar is to lose the North is joyful.
One question that is just a question: is the poor man today poorer than the poor man of yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who most viciously criticize Piketty's book haven't read it!
It's easy to read, took me a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, capital ownership, merit and inheritance in log term.
It shows that the concentration of capital today joins that of the early 20th century before 1914, it shows that it was the two world wars that brought down the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I'm asking you how long it took you to read this piece of paper knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limitations.
Second, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is correct, it can be debated without reading the book which essentially argues in one direction in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read.
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his paper, summarized by the press, false?
I haven't read it and I won't.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis, and it is the one that seems to me to be pure smoke.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has not mankind become rich in general?
And this enrichment, added to the population growth, is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17.
A time when most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope this prize will not be a burden to the girl and that she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my best wishes to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or anywhere else - not even in the popular quarters of Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a little strange?
She thanked her father for giving her so much freedom but mentioned that if she hadn't been where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Is Malala herself not one of those colorful perverts?
You should not have any  airtime  on this site.
You're a horrible pervert yourself.
This is absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
Her father runs a school for girls and is a supporter of equal rights for women.
It is, and always has been, for her to receive higher education and have the right to decide for herself her marriage.
However, he is unusual in Pakistan, as he believes women are equal to men.
What she was saying was that an average Pakistani girl often gets married at 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't put it out loud enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but maybe she means that if her father hadn't given her freedom, she would have been married at 14.
I'm rather disappointed with this entry into season 4 and especially Jessica Lange who is clearly having a bit of a hard time finding her Marlene Dietrich's sosie character.
I just watched the last two seasons which are quite different but I have to admit it's one of the best horror series, one of the most complete!
A fascinating first episode.
The production is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing Bowie's anachronistic Life on Mars is just overwhelming.
I haven't watched this new season yet (which will be my last without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I'd rather have it all at once than watch 13 episodes aired over three to four months.
But one thing is for sure, aside from the extraordinary Jessica Lange, is that the risks of staging and editing are what are most of all bothering me.
AHS has an avalanche of original plans that ridicule the seepage of today's productions.
It's a little bit tricky to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next few seasons without even waiting to be able to measure the quality.
Jessica Lange is a mainstay of this show, but, you say so well, there's a lot more to it than that.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is truly one of the pillars of the series outside of technical qualities.
And I'm looking out for her a lot.
Then I find the show is writing wrong, it wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly down, season 2 was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end up like a 24-hour timeline.
But everybody does what they want, huh?
I'm not going to look at it again because everyone has to do the same thing.
I just share my point of view. Nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it's going to be fatal.
But then, here, it's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - let's cut government spending instead.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to know how to spend failed.
Triggering controversy about relatively minor expenditure items, such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we're all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to call out of their vows and all the while some in each camp are pretending that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are -- and voters see clearly in their game and find them bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
 Debt  are assets held mainly by financial institutions in this country.
Debt is nothing to worry about.
I would not see any problem in the government taking a third of my income (even before we talk about consumer taxes) if I thought it would be used wisely.
But that's not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
Nigel Farage is said to have been not quite honest about how to cut taxes but well, if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies for almost useless wind turbines and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you come to a figure that makes the Labour and Lib Dem tax on the most luxurious homes sound ridiculous.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 a year will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay about £10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 will pay about £70,000 (a little over a third).
What about social security contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking and car tickets, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30 percent of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the cartoon.
I get paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let us not pretend to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it is not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can an unemployed person who's looking for a job on a door-to-door basis prove it?
Even though 20% of the unemployed wouldn't look, that means 80% look and can't find.
I'm unemployed, so what do I care about more than what others are looking for or not?
Any prospective recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances as well.
I haven't heard from the Employment Office in months, so what do you mean, the agents are more busy with checks than they are with job announcements?
I don't see the point.
Because it is not the State's job to provide jobs.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then Pole Emploi must be eliminated.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, and in this case we must ensure that the unemployed do their duty well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks for their transport licence from the users of a means of transport, a service manager or employees of their work etc.
Nobody shouts scandal in these cases, right?
It is good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I dealt with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ERA were poorly established, and one of the cases, cut by 40%, had to be fought hard.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
The current trend is in the form of registration and control, whereas, by law, Pôle Emploi is close to being an insurance company.
I would add that the issue of compensation should concern only employees, who pay the allowances.
Political and unpaid Frenchmen are giving rights they don't actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that worthy unemployment insurance contributes to the enhancement of wage labour.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In fact, we need a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS so that the virus doesn't reach that conflict zone.
The situation would then be similar to the spread of the plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of the population at that time.
The Saudis have been keen to ban Hajj in Mecca this year for Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 of them have had their visa application denied because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was a case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hajj in the 1980s, probably infected by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit presence.
Is it heartless to propose that Ebola patients not be allowed to fly to Europe?
I thought it was common sense, but apparently those who know decided that we could risk tens of thousands of lives...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be put into strict quarantine.
No one's going out.
Only medical personnel can enter.
21 days after you treat patients before they can leave.
If they get the Ebola virus while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were infected after contact with people in West Africa despite taking all necessary precautions.
We can stop the disease from spreading.
It is spread mainly by airlines.
Let's stop them from offering to fly to those countries.
In addition, customs officials at airports should be trained to identify people with Ebola-like symptoms, so that they can be quarantined immediately.
May he succeed in getting the message out to the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will be worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt he will be able to establish the dogma of God as the image of the total working cortex of the planet.
It's still a long way from that concept.
It's only been 20 years since information emerged as the gift of humanity, while religion, from the brain, may have been guiding our actions since Lucy.
What is the point of becoming a second Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is now a minority in France, and no one is forced to join it.
Critics would not step into the church anyway, except for the small number of Protestants in France.
What's the next step, we're getting rid of the notion of sin, too "anxious"?
@Louise: Sorry the church doesn't have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will reach more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you see it was pre-existing in Christ.
Hillel had said a century before that, "Don't do to others what you don't want to be done to you, that's the whole Torah and the rest is just commentary: go and study".
Christianity goes beyond reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "promoting justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is this a return to communism?
Next step is removing the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who upset moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to take their part in the ethical debates in our societies and promote justice, peace, and brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and forced into immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It's not a thought.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even ran a fundraiser for it) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you're interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM for £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM for £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The computer department's junkie blocks all the cool sites.
Hello, is it £30 then 20% off, or is £30 including the 20% off?
Please note however: the PC version is only for DX11.
I was surprised, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Plus, I bought it on Steam, so no refunds, it's nothing.
It's time to buy a new video card
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'd erase it from your library if they decided to crack down on people who buy it there while they're out of the intended area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So was France in 1940 a "putrid land"?
So, this Nobel Prize seems like a poisoned gift to me.
You have to like France in '40, the "strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize for Literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, you don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Will Brazilians, Chinese or Australians read Modiano, which is already hard to read in French and which describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobles are more credible, but frankly, I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It'd be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and the rest, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They'll appreciate Mr.
Modiano is worth his while, if they don't already know him!
You, on your part, keep hanging out with Levi and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let's see who won the Nobel Prize for Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Say hello to the awful.
Ever since I drove one in Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing followed me here.
Maybe she's trying to crush me?
Or swallow me like the horrible computer in Superman III?
Hello Dantra, is there still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I've had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the beer and cider party in Nottingham.
It was a mess.
I've managed to sample 19 different beers, with Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
It was really hard driving home on Sunday.
Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather's house to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner's luck, I was able to start off with several decent bets.
I hope that when I reach 95 I will be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of lard on it.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Buddha and you'll see how wrong you are, dear Christian.
I do not want to upset you, but I think you are a little off the subject.
This famous whole, it prohibits the search for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
She's reporting the arms trade right away.
Either you have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or you have big eyes closed.
You have to choose.
It's not by keeping our eyes closed that we get to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you are making a monumental counter-sense: all the authorities, organizations or associations representative, Muslim or not, who have formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, French or not Muslim, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who doesn't say a word of consent.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for all.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the French Jewish people's approval of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that they are wrong to doubt this.
This principle is, in my view, the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the unraveling of French society.
If there's no doubt, just say it.
Who says no consent, but agrees to what?
Consent to proximity to ISIS or to ISIS's conviction.
Silence is a very practical weapon for those who want to save goats and cabbages.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically unsustainable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, take revenge on the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has been drawn between their proposals for decentralisation and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be stunned to lose all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing at the wrong time.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't care about Scotland because they don't have a seat.
They can do whatever they want with no electoral sanctions.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that losing Labour seats in Westminster to the SNP is a long-term good thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's gonna shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They're going to be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who are going to cut their heads off in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the  PROMESSE  thinking he was saving his party but unaware he was signing the death warrant for his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are holding their leader accountable.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats are not from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they can force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's more important than that.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Cutting the pumps from 8% to 85% is not a great election strategy.
Moreover, once the Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on matters relating to England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and she did it well.
Yet he is still running for prime minister in 2015 and has been since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over their shoulder and see what they're reading, how they're reading, and all the way through.
The lives of others in East Germany or the KGB in the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination with surveillance techniques.
In the long run, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.

Thank you for the article.
Since DRM management is not implemented under this system, I have to read hacked files, books in the public domain or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a needle.
I'm not sorry, given the price I paid for the Kobo.
I am amazed at the widespread abduction of users from the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
In your general public library, you will regularly notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**title, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably negligible.
For example, Finnegans Wake by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the age of big data, data doesn't really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in one trunk.
The collection of anonymous data when there's a profile...
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that is, which does not allow to identify the readers or authors.
But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of acid-ridden schizophrenic children.
It's even worse if you consider Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
Interestingly, some of Erdogan's supporters think Islamism is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine.
Well seen. But Turkey doesn't want to shoot itself in the foot unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it's actually shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog:  The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of retaliation or was merely advising caution.
This second option is more likely, and in any case what is really surprising is that today the diplomatic commitment between Iran and the United States is about Syria, Israel and the security of the region 
The short article you link to is important and should be read with the realistic observations/warnings previously coming from Iran about Afghanistan around 1979-80.
Who are these moderates who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy is pushing the world to the bottom and I would suggest that those who refer to non-existent  moderates  pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending others' children to fight in World War III.
 It's even worse than that if you consider Erdogan's religious fundamentalism  Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in my head.
It would take a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should we ?
Do you realize that neither the perpetrators nor the victims have the slightest chance of being alive?
A little late for that, my friend...
Aren't criminals barely old now, like 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly concerning the CUP triumvirate that planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War I in revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a slum of Central Asia around the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a madness !
An impressive mastery of the sophistication of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we're in vain for contact with the real world.
What unarguable clips.
The fetus will always hear a heartbeat even in the womb of a pregnant mother.
Lesbian couples may just want a child and not want to be accepted.
Same goes for the straight couples.
And the children!
What a shame to call them psychologically unbalanced.
One day, they will be old enough to defend themselves, say they're happy to live, earn a living and pay that lady's pension (?)
GPA is probably a temporary "solution" to the evolution of medicine that our world knows.

The important thing is that this practice is framed so that the "commercialization" of the body is limited.
But isn't cosmetic surgery and cosmetics just as much a marketing of the body?
- What is it ?
It is certainly more elegant to get a good one to fatten up in a distant country via the Internet and Pay Pal than to assume responsibility and avoid scandal in another century near home without shouting it out on every roof! ...
These practices were not done in the name of the church! . . .
It's not just Christians and believers who refuse these practices...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.

I don't know why there's so much derogatory commentary about what Paul Mason is saying, maybe it's posted by people who've never been cool, even for a few years!
I think there's an article in the sports section about football waiting for your comments.
That's a great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of the culture of Northern England.
No wonder Paul Mason has a good grasp of social and political context, but he understands things well.
The Northern soul is still alive, but it was vampirized by capitalism and today it's basically a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can listen to it if you're in the London area in November: 99psoul is going to release soul vinyls again, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I thought the same story, too, but here's a well-written, well-thought-out little article.
Your reviews really need to be more constructive.
That's a great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're just glad you got away from Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.

Whatever the train station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket to the post-Victoria stop!
The early days of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently police series titled Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is getting more and more toxic.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu is not seeking peace because he wants to continue occupying and colonizing (by the way, it was also the case with Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes and put them on the rock and went into the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative got up in anger and shouted: "What are you talking about?
The Israelites weren't even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: "Now that things are clear
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not lower its guard ...
That the anti-Israelists are unhappy with this is obvious, not the intended purpose...
Anti-Zionist: But I have answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical relationship ...
And it 's always been this way since politics became globalized ...
Avoidance, avoidance.
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it will last!
You don't answer for the creation of Israel.
What force relationship allowed for the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force to be reckoned with today !
Do you think so ?
Besides, it's not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
A lot of what he says is just pseudo-chomskyist, written-up crap.
That proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It's just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious burden, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths we prefer not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is gonna get more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks in a pretentious way and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but this whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that he's just telling people not to vote and rather to shake hands and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting democratic engagement to that is completely useless, with both parties (to slightly different degrees) ruling essentially in favor of private interests, multinational companies and the rich, at no point does he just say that we should completely ignore politics because those parties don't act on our behalf: he insists that rather than just starting and disconnecting for five years, people should be much more involved in political demonstrations, trying to influence political movements, and petitioning for political elections, and trying to get more political votes at the local level.
I'm not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think being politically active in presenting his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are pimps who will change their minds if they really risk losing the election), but it's outrageous to see all these condescending answers that say that this fool who makes Jesus tells young people not to bother to vote and just hope that everything will get better because it really distorts his arguments.
His solution is highly questionable and it would be good if people debated what he actually said rather than simply labeling him irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
- Yes, thank you.
The thing about the vote was completely distorted.
The pointlessness of putting a ballot in a ballot box every five years makes me very angry because my vote really doesn't count.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and MPs reporting locally to their constituents.
I also challenge the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his own (written by others).
He is intelligent enough to have his own sayings and ideas, even though these are strongly influenced by the kind of counterculture anti-establishment thinkers and academics Suzanne would like to group under the label  pseudo-chomskystes .
I'm pretty sure in a debate he'd be able to convince Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, if Suzanne would do Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a porch, even with the nodding on the editing!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but eventually became one of his fans and invited him to his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he's coming from.
It draws on a political discourse that has been around for generations, but has been marginalized by the mainstream media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This is a particularly clear sign to me that intellectual debate has long since ceased in the R&Ds of history, where professional historians have become a minority and trade in specialists has been reduced to the benefit of ready-to-think Sciences Po-type condensed papers for press papers.
I, for one, had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault the need to take on a guilty one, a scapegoat.
They both develop very rational reasoning, but that rationality rests on these scapegoats who are the key to their thinking.
I think, rather, that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is part of a very archaic thought, the thought of sacrifice, which is also the magic thought.
We solve the problem of the relationship to each other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-liberal and/or/liberal slope (the second term marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to seek the state's help for its markets) in the sense of at least state/not state at all in Foucault's view.
The old dream of the base that is self-organizing .
Her thinking is built on the guilt of the state: without that guilt she cannot stand.
Whoever says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a stand against the three intellectuals mentioned here .
Not even a support group .
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its god of the time, Stalin, the little father of the people.
Oulala, you must have read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology from Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would not be amused by attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet gives a deep reflection on the individual and the collective today, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he's an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by hard-left humanities scientists who can't stand the fact that we're not loyal to their mantras is pretty ridiculous.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
I think that the most important point to add is the attitude of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other yellow people I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely amazing.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends about it, then.
And where in Russia could a Russian meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember the last time I saw a Chinese.
In London and they were kind to me when they learned I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s, the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same about white people.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou long ago, in the mid-20th century, and I still hear some of them make violent anti-white remarks.
My father's not happy that his oldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity spreads outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
I have been told that Russians have a particular prejudice against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and areas where they are most likely to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I've heard the Australian opinions about the Chinese and Aborigines.
It's really weird for a stranger to tell me that I can't stand Chinese, when I've met two in my life (one of them abroad), I haven't kept any bad memories of them, everyone deserves each other, and, in fact, the people in London were very kind.
Otherwise you can't remember who you're meeting, everyone's worth it, how do you remember who was who?
You know what 's weird ?
That you and the other Russian here were talking about the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, like they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you're still dating that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with white women, by comparison?
None, because there's a good chance these white folks' parents would physically assault them.
No measure of impartiality in justice.
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France is still manipulated by strongly marked left-wing groups like the judiciary union...
@Marabout: Sorry, but the courts are frankly right.
When it comes to the Judicial Syndicate, he represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it requires two obstacles to be removed.
The political view of the observer and the factual interpretation of the judge.
The legal obligation to re-evaluate the fundamentals remains.
The measure of its failure to comply with all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, makes a distinction between error and partiality.
It would be futile to claim that justice is not shared between these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance are not subject to objective analysis.
And if all this is not analysed, how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics implicitly showing that it is starting from very low.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to insert the following into the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
Subject sensitive in proportion to the power of nuisance* conferred on the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The area under consideration is the exploitation* of heirs by notaries* through fraudulent procedures* by succession genealogists.
This profession earns €150 million a year, while it is covered by the quasi-impunity of the French notary.
To understand their mechanism, some of these were reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this is combined with the statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogists and heirs who are reluctant to be spoiled, a whole set of case-law which is contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria an elaborate form of lying?
I'm sure they're totally prohibitive.
More equipment to scam the disabled.
You could say that, but my brother has one of those all-terrain tricycles, built to fit his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like a normal wheelchair with overcrowded wheels and tires never could.
As they say, the tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like something Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The tankchair looks epic.
I don't think the inventor of the Whill ever had to clean a dog's crotch on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all the way, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra-long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a longboarding penchant.
There are hills here that they'd like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are people who really put that kind of price on a bike, so you see.
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, though.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance.
Only if they've become disabled.
The thing is, the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know relevantly that we need.
You can't really say the Whill is minimalist.
It's an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a draft, it's not meant to be made.
I'm glad the wheelchair  long distance  doesn't hit the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during heavy bombing of densely populated residential areas.
Two million people have been held captive by Israel's blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under 18.
The eight-year-olds have lived their whole lives under Israeli blockade!
The situation is unique in the world, unacceptable, illegal, as well, since this blockade imposes a collective punishment on all civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little bit of their cement to the black market ... "
Ah, that's not wood tongue, it's concrete and armed lady...
References are there to support an argument or fact.
- He 's anti-Zionist .
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, that's for sure, and recognized.
Two million people have been held captive by Israel's blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, a situation unacceptable to anyone with a heart and a moral sense.
The United States has a well-guarded territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn't have the time to govern because the dictatorship (who you know supported him) ruled him out!
Remember, after lifting it, Morsi re-established the blockade!!!
And I'm a Western, so I approve of...
Jonathan , what are you doing ?
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built against the backdrop of the people who chose their masters!
It's a lot of work to have a boat, Aleks.
I hope you've thought it through.
Couchsurfing is so much cooler than Airbnb.
That's the very definition of the nonprofit sharing economy.
A lot of people just want a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in another way.
It's always a lot cheaper than a hotel, if you're looking for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly with them in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this?
What does she rent on?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The verb  to let  is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you didn't notice.
It would be better to have the right boat insurance, make sure it is 100% compliant with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to do business there (which they will certainly refuse).
Have you ever thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The panics are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would still be near where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our pennies...

No, Marine Le Pen is wrong.
Populism ?
There is no truth except that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is rising in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said !
Capitalism is not going to get impoverished!
High finance, speculation, plays with our businesses, so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our food, so our food, with the care structures, so our health, with our debts, so our institutions.
They're a threat to our daily lives by the same and our money they hold.
All for the sake of some hyper-mega-obesity about money.
To prove otherwise, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance".
It was 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild bank official as Minister of Economy, a story that helped better defend the interests of the banksters, who were solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Wasn't there anyone else who was competent?
What do you call that, turning his jacket around, lowering his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
Actually, we don't know much about Marine Le Pen.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee really refused to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that neither side seemed to be sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee left the area soon because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was rough at the beginning of the day, I don't know if it was still rough at the end of the battle.
The fighting also ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this to the next battle, the Battle of the Falklands, where the survivors are rescued in pictures of a calm sea in broad daylight.
Moreover, the rescue workers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this point.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick Wikipedia search:
A certain confusion prevailed among the German ships as to the fate of the two battlecruisers, which had disappeared in the dark after ceasing fire, and a pursuit race began.
Leipzig saw something burning, but as he approached he saw that it was just a wreck.
The Nuremberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, bent and severely damaged but still moving.
After pointing his spotlights at the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was rejected and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
With no reliable information, von Spee ruled that the Good Hope had escaped and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.
So if that's true, the Germans, stuck in the dark before the radar was invented, didn't know a ship had sunk, so they couldn't look for survivors.
They also thought there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they defected to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should have made their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally caught.
Several votes are cast in the UMP to demand that it be entered into law that a person who is definitively convicted is therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect the elected members of the left.
But noon, this is a joke.
I propose an inscription on the wall with the magistrates' advice
When will the ban on trade unions in already protected areas be lifted?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
It is supported by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always ready to seduce those who will take advantage of their immobility to hinder the actions of real politicians, who are really trying to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is sufficient.
I met them on the subway at noon with their little "Justice money" signs. They came from the province and didn't know the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of its party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even far-right unions targeted its members and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are completely free.
If the right now is ignoring the judicial news it is simply because it has committed facts that are relevant to it!
There is no example of a left-wing person who has had so much to do with justice but not all of those who have been the object of his attention have been treated favorably.
On the other hand, it must be remembered that the left-wing magistrates' union is not the only magistrates' union and is a minority.
The fact that a minister is so committed to supporting unions shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you cite may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancellery, it is no secret.
The question now is whether the "mission" of some judges is not more dirty than teaching.
@Gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: you forget that magistrates are not public officials like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody ?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel, what are you doing?
I think even the most famous starving idiot realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I'd be surprised if someone accepted their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to a successful career.
The One Direction is filling stadiums all over the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or went to the West End.
Popstars, the precursor to all of these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is actually a member of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all of them were in the Eurovision contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and all the others have been competing in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars on British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens to most stars who don't compete anyway.
Few people after a tube succeed in making another one.
Anyway, most singers/bands can at best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
Her fame comes in part from her marriage to a footballer who breathes through her mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock journey, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar players who smoke grass in their dad's garage and swing three chords on a grade school level poem will surely become stars and the only question is how much they want to hit before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it creates a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied -- a distance that quickly turns to racism, because the sacrist ethnologists present these distant people as infinitely superstitious and full of ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing things are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, by practical considerations of everyday life.
Except you're recklessly interpreting it the other way around.
Or, rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières are also not a little sacred?
Our bias is like being reminded to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and confined to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It's ephemeral decor to furnish the vacuum.
That's all I can say.
That's a great article, thank you.
The recent pantheonisation of the Republic's iconic figures is an illustration that the sense of sanctity still lives on.
Who still believes the interpretations of archaeologists !
Any other discipline would challenge the life-long, not at all scientific interpretations of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a critic comparing disciplines to make a little laugh?
Because what is good for archaeology is also good for the interpretations that other disciplines give.
That would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your disdain for archaeologists is totally unjustified !
It is through them that we are constantly discovering treasures, valuable testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example of comparative archaeology here is exciting.
This method is not very old and before archaeologists relied on their instincts and knowledge, and they could be wrong.
Today we have such good technical and scientific means that the interpretation of the excavations is better but can still be challenged by other discoveries!
There is a longstanding (and old) controversy surrounding the shamanism advanced by prehistoric scholar Jean Clottes (cf. his book  The Shamans of Prehistory , particularly the expanded re-edition of the scientific controversy, published in the editions of La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex ?
For you, Mike, I could get into it.
So, this is over with us?
I don't really understand why can't we keep going on three?
This paper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the ditch?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We can't watch a musical about this, but it would be too gay!
We could have expected that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse's back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, may I suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
Can I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Rather than get ridiculed with these childish ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Go on then.
If these childish ass jokes are so shocking to you, you don't have to be a part of it, do you?
You also know that this paper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it's quite possible to do both and publish an article about anal sex?
Is this the subject that shocks you, or is it the fact that people laugh at it?
Nevertheless, the amateur video of the crash is on the net...
Amateur video of the crash on the net... ??
If the FOM chose not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no way those of the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the drivers it would have pulled out the safety because at some point another vehicle (e.g. a fire truck) was entering the circuit.
But it had to be finished quickly before the typhoon, which we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not think it was right to advance the time of departure (TV rights, advertising, money...).
But other than that, they're good at protecting pilots.
Well, I agree with you.
But there's also the fact that if the very British FOM gets SC in, it's going to allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at restart to beat the Englishman who was leading then...
You're freaking out on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to figure out all your shit.
No, I just didn't.
There have been a lot of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts commissioners in mortal danger for a distant history of one driver's chance of winning at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that gets the safety, it's the FIA.
Shade of size.
In the light of amateur images, the absence of images allows the FIA to avoid troubling questions such as: How does the Commissioner wave a green flag in the middle of the action and continue to do so after the accident (see full video after the accident)
No, it's not because the video is deemed too violent that the FIA blocks the footage of the accident but because one of the commissioners is clearly seen waving a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that the race is now under a yellow flag.
Some comments show a dark disregard for F1.
Yes, dear Stephen, the race is no longer under a yellow flag after the crash site, hence the green flag is raised.
This is the usual procedure.
The Commissioner's post just downstream of the accident (depending on the circumstances, it may be 10 metres or 100 metres after the accident) waves the green to tell the drivers to return to normal speed.
Sensationalism is selling advertising.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government's propaganda campaign, but I'm afraid that ultimately it's just about the money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having a sex life, advertising and media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex lives.
The news is doing exactly the same thing.
Making a buzz with information that you really don't need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can keep controlling them.
 When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all get scared  It should be  they're off the rails  not  they cough 
Given the medical reference,  cough  is much better said in this context than  derail .
I wonder if all the people who are worried that Ebola could spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're giving them too much credit.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola with Murdoch...
Great article, thank you.
A short, concise article that beautifully and firmly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
I was laughing.
I'm depressed that the media is talking about most things with this optimism backwards.
The aim is once again to keep us scared and anxious enough (without becoming hysterical) that the government can scratch us when it needs to.
I think it makes perfect sense that if we have to go through a budget emergency without any crisis, a terrorist emergency without any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis without any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of being governed by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and for still being part of this world almost 35 years later.
Plus , it must have been awful at first , given the context of the 1980s and ' 90s .
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of spending years there.....
It's a completely useless witness.
It's like we always do when we talk about science.
Not only are the evidence useless, but taken alone, it cannot be used as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of facts.
@trafic: The testimonies cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps this is why we should not ask psychiatric patients questions when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatric mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
So this is an objective symptom.
When I say it's a hoax, it's subjective testimony that's not important.
Ah, because the evidence of fact (= here this evidence, which testifies to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is of no use in a scientific approach?
So what do you base your research on?
What about fantasies?
Do you put the fanciful theories and facts on the same level?
 Resistance : the word "bad" admired by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who consider themselves great psychologists after reading Dansembourg.
@Jim: There are a lot of meaningless buzzwords in psychiatry.
Cyrulnik has given us the shot of resilience.
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he has given us a reliable scale to quantify this resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company?
Does that remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to get the air sentinels out...
So why is that?
It was a great show, and it looks like the people who came out of it are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they gonna get the kids to hang out?
The only solution I can think of is piss-caca humor, which would kill the show.
It was already a children's show.
The kids were hanging out.
Oh, because it's a children's show?
The UKIP work for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in the Supermarionation ?
It won't be the same if you don't see the wires and the animation is done right.
I'm looking forward to seeing this (though I'm an adult), but I hope it gives a channel the idea to rebroadcast the old ones.
The series has hardly ever stopped being shown here in Australia; for at least 40 years we have had one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-tier commercial channels and can still be seen at these times.
And the half-hour episodes are now at 5:30 Monday through Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a sad 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Temple Mountain" in or under the mosque of the esplanades!!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In fact, all the Israeli excavations underneath and around the mosque's splanades for decades have yielded nothing.
The temple mount if it exists, it's somewhere else.
Can it be in Argentine?
This mountain is not sought after simply because it is the hill on which the mosque plot was built.
Its top, or Dome of the Rock, stands out in the middle of the Omar Mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it was the mountain of Moriah where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there's no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to recall this regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, who had accepted the two-state plan, and has continuously sabotaged it!).
It is also good to show how peaceful the annexation of Jerusalem was not.
Will God ever know His own people?
The shortest Jewish joke is, "Praise be to God!"
To show off the tourism in Israel, we are often shown half-naked young naïves lying on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo illustrating the article.
It's a little scary, though.
And this picture is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
It's a pity that the Reuters photographer didn't take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to go home to the Temple Mount and who prefer to crush the Jewish faithful down below, praying at the Mourning Wall.
@Mat, if this photo bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, it's not the photographer, it's this woman and the ideology she's spreading that should be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end up in tears.
The only way to end this system is through revolution.
Since the economy seems to be going into a downward spiral, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever greater wages to the small elite at the top.
You're right, it's not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of grumbling and moaning when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems but also shows your employer that people are not fucked up with impunity.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case it's sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you've forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
This can't all end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that it lasted.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TIPP) aims to increase profits for companies owned by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that's exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this plan and are trying to warn people about the unimaginable damage this deal will do to our lives.
It's only recently that we've started talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement so look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated behind your back.
Didn't Churchill say blood, sweat and tears?
This is a good result, whereas digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link is probably the car market.
This gentleman is right. In the 18th century, there were unions in all regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let that one (after all, his officers, the others, nobody knows anything) think he's the safe depository of France's eternal values, and she'll fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic is comforting.
Even though it's getting more and more uncomfortable for her...
You still miss the union of married men, single women, single men, lost dogs and I don't know what else.
If you don't spell French correctly, I'll join the union.
You've been warned, it's your fault.
The protection of the trade unions is already a major problem for the defence of the interests of the individual, and this has created a break in equality with other citizens.
We are told not to laugh at the fear of risk on the part of a public official.
We can imagine a system that guarantees a certain degree of freedom of expression without unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, disaster is assured.
And with the wagons coming in, the government is very pleased.
What kind of security are you talking about?
I mean, ignorance is...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other civil servants, since that is the subject here commented on...
Suppress "through its delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It's going to be: "8.
All workers participate in collective determination of working conditions and in the management of undertakings.'
This is absolutely essential with the breakthrough of information power.
And yet you opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically titled  The Great British Bake Off review . ?????
Wait, the section was right there, empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it was Joffrey's wedding I watched, and I can tell you some of it was well seasoned.
The episode of Joffrey's wedding is one of the best moments (though misleading: it was wine) in television history.
Also, the cake mmmh...
Game of Thrones !
I love the GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, oddly enough, the show ends with the worst baker winning. Nobody's done anything like that.
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and relatives outside finally had an effect on them?
In the weeks before, all these outsiders were kept out of the way.
And there's also this idea of  playing safety, there's always next week  that disappears last week.
I love cooking, but I can't imagine myself getting into this.
I'm grateful to those who do this and that gives us great entertainment and encourages us to try new things.
Let's get this to GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
The professionals usually take days to make them and they had to make one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to break down, I don't know how they could pick a winner.
At Luis's, the only real flaw they could find was the base being a little dry (although I agree with Hollywood that the green ice on Richard's mill didn't make sense, anyway Richard had already lost by then).
I must admit that some of the challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time allocated.
There's also cancer waiting, with the solar wind blows.
Well, we're definitely doing well right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You're confusing solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field were weakening, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to drive ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and cancer.
Fortunately, the ozone layer doesn't block UV rays.
They have a bunch of useful functions you don't know about.
If we limit ourselves to humans, they are of interest in allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to warm ourselves (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic UVCs and allows UVA and most UVBs to pass through.
You know you don't have to be condescending and treat your interlocutor like a stay-at-home mom when you post a comment.
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to be pedagogical.
Not to mention I'm a regular melanoma, but UV radiation only accelerates its development.
They don't provoke it.
For example: not all people who are tan have melanoma.
Or, when a doctor tells you to avoid the sun and live in the basement, you better not listen because UV rays are necessary for every human being.
Excessive use, on the other hand, is like everything else: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV rays directly cause melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And more importantly, can we get it to the blender?
Or put it in the blender...
I think the majority of those interested in it have established that anything can be folded if you apply enough force and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the use it is intended for.
I think the military would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a frontline communication device.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
Most of those interested in this have found that anything can be bent if enough force is applied.
Except for a Nokia 3310.
Specifically, is it already bent?
We make that joke every time we talk.
I decided to count them.
That's the fourth folding joke I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before you install any specific software, you imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and you can't see how it could get back there.
So, what is this?
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which iOS has not been installed properly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put testing software on all of them?
The photographs on eBay clearly show the absence of an FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
Ah, the article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrialists produce in industrial areas. We are promoting super-U but all the brands and small businesses are concerned.
But to answer your post, if it's possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After that, everyone is free to set his priorities where he wants them.
For me, food is one of them.
Go without resentment, I'll kiss you
They call themselves bobos, or better known as boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological software that makes them disconnect from reality.
This is the total thought-reason breakdown.
They're experts in gestures, for example, claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in turtle farming, joining the left-caviar, from which they sometimes originate, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while on holiday in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens cannot stand this mix of loose ideology and turtle-headedness, so do not be surprised to encounter criticism of them often.
Wow, thanks for this thorough and thorough theorizing and all the details involved (airplane, shower...).
I'd love to be a part of it, but I'm not getting into it.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monoblock.
You understand the concept of left-caviar?
Well, you're able to understand the concept of the boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecological matters.
The boboecolo is one of them, but it is only the most visible margin of the eco-labels because it is the one that infests the media.
That's a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, nobody wants to look that giraffe in the face.
It's so badly crafted, it looks vaguely like a female nude.
Shut up, you're next to the plate.
You have to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of truth in this work.
But you simply have no legitimate right to comment because you have not spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
What's not important is that Emin doesn't know how to draw and seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really succeeded in becoming fabulously rich and famous without any artistic ability.
That's art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
That's not really a proven fact.
It's more of an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic reproductions of dogs smoking while playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than just representing reality.
If that's all you're looking for, a camera will do the trick.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the picture speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still a saving to be made: horse-riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard, or the status of generals who are no longer on active duty....
The French have been reducing their numbers, but as all the other countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operational without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses, the inadequacies of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
This is a bad blow for the local communities concerned, who are losing a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@edmond: that's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, it's really not possible at home...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look elsewhere where the gabbie is certain.
May all those who have been around the military thing come here and say, face to face, that there is no money wasted in this area and this without a laughing stock...
If we apply the same potion to the whole public service, the public finances will be a little better.
And for Josie: really loud: look at the inflation of public employment in other ministries and you will understand why the Defense can feel a little busy!
Well, the savings that everybody agrees on to say we should do, they have to show up somewhere, right?
The people who get hit are mourning the murder when it comes to their homes, poor darlings.
I should, but I should not be caught up in it because in this case it's a crime, not an economy.
Guignols, get out of here!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for the local communities, the story repeats itself at every post office closure, maternity ward, hospital, barracks.
But everybody's for savings, of course.
It's strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and isn't happy about the savings made in public spending.
This article is truly the most stunning thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It's depressing to scroll through your Facebook thread and see that 80% of your friends started their statuses with the phrase  This embarrassing moment .
I think they're gonna make a movie of it.
It's probably based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on their ex on the bus to work and only then realizes that their skirt is back in their pants.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
No, really, I think the author is playing the typical British man who has always been taught to hide his emotions and to grit.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle over who gets the rights?
I don't have the internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
I don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how amazing this article is.
Charlie really just demonstrated that he's at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I'm going to be upset!
I absolutely need to share it with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so they can finally have the light and discover the incredible brightness and unsurpassed genius that springs from Mr. Brooker's keyboard like a divine glow.
Oh, my God, that was really bad.
Especially if it's not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite, you know.
This shows a positive development in democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice we are being confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play tartuffs at every meeting to save the planet.
So we as citizens decide to take matters into our own hands.
With the Commissioner they put in place, all these good recommendations have flown away....
Translate: Wind farms and solar farms are the Round Points of tomorrow.
All financed by the taxpayer.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the whole industry is not controlled, it is best to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided, of course, that we drastically reduce our consumption.
Electricity from renewable sources to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned.
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions at production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity from renewable wind or PV is already more GHG than other stages and especially gas, or worse than coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittent use.
Replacing nuclear power with renewable wind or PV would be against the fight against CO2.
I am not insulting you, I am a doctor of physics from 1981 and I have done research in nuclear physics. I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I didn't say you're the one who's lending me ideas I haven't said anything about Germany nothing nothing in fact you haven't answered what I'm saying and like all right-wingers tear down the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is a cost-effective and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for a new directive on the protection of the environment.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a South Asian giant...!!
Last time Pakistan won against Hindustan.
It's no wonder, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your attitude.
It would have been the same if they had called India a South Asian giant...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would be just opening a Pandora's box full of corruption and mafia.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Athletico Kolkata beating Mumbai 3-0.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions India is spending on IPL cricket and now football, how could we ever compete with our noisy neighbors?
The low-cost pitcher race is cash.
Too bad about such a good project.
For the incident, the possible design defect is only manifested with too cold helium.
So we may not be in a design flaw, but we're in a implementation flaw.
Unlike Arianespace, which is a private company, it seems that Soyuz is owned by the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here, the state is its own insurer.
They might pay for the satellites in frigates who knows..
This is all the more unfortunate as many media outlets are locking up only the headlines of articles - and many readers are keeping only those headlines.
In total, this creates a false impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
I agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project when it is only a problem of the launcher.
