Members of the Welsh Assembly are afraid they'll look like Muppets
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are dismayed by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament  member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal is the plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the title could provoke ridicule.
One Labour MP said his group was concerned that it was rhyming with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales, in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid party said the group as a whole was unhappy and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was approaching a name change with an open mind, but noted that the MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is now preparing legislation to introduce name changes, said: The final decision on how the members of the Welsh Assembly will be named will, of course, be made by the members themselves.
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, where a variant of calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
As regards the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the title Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant gained the most support in the public debate.
Members of the assembly are clearly proposing alternatives, but the battle for consensus may bring concern to Speaker Elin Jones, who is due to table a legislative proposal in a few weeks.
The reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules for disqualification of members and a draft committee system.
The members of the Assembly shall vote on the question of their title in the context of the discussion of new legislation.
Macedonians will vote to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country's name will change to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is expected to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek territory and has repeatedly protested against the country's requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonia's President Gyorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, has said he will not abide by the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that the name change is simply the price of EU and NATO membership.
The bells at St. Martin's will go off as the churches of Harlem fight to survive
"The old people I've spoken to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", says Mr. Adams.
Today there is none.
He thinks the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are connecting in a different way now", he says.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood, where people go regularly".
As for the churches, he's worried that the money from the sale of the property won't last as long as their leaders expect, and sooner or later they'll be right back where they started.
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments filled with people of this type who do little to help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white", he says, "and so the day will soon come when these churches will be closed down completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become members of the church".
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became the black metropolis of the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930's.
The building was taken over by the black congregation, whose worship services were held nearby.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping boulevard, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they ordered a bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell tower the "Bells of the Poor".
The expert who played the bell in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first bell in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell in a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says he hasn't been replaced at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, St. Martin's has been a complicated story for architects and builders, some of whom have been appointed by lay church officials, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Council of Elders  the leading body of the parish, composed of lay representatives  sent a letter to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese  would try to pass on the costs to the Council of Elders, even though the hiring of architects and builders sent by the diocese had not been involved.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California while diving for lobsters
According to official reports, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California on Saturday, the opening day of lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. this morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, and then he and his group paddled to help him out of the water.
Hammel stated that the call at first was considered a pleasure from catching the lobster, but then you realized that the scream was a bite from me!
He bit me!
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that he had torn the entire area of the clavicle.
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" adds Hammel.
The boy was taken in critical condition by helicopter to Council Children's Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of shark was behind the attack.
Swimming Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area weeks ago, but it was determined to be a non-threatening species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for investigation and security.
Giles noted that over 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's wants to counter the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains with a cosmetics mall-style alleyway, where specialized saleswomen will be available.
As part of a strong push into the UK's £2.8 billion cosmetics market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods decline, the cosmetics aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, will be expanded to more stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to the efforts of supermarkets to find uses for the shelves formerly used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its cosmetics line to 3,000 products and for the first time introduce brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space thanks to branded seats similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique makeup line, so most of the products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, two Saintsbury's stores will be testing the franchise of retail perfume retailer Fragrance Shop, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week and will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, next year.
Shopping online and the shift towards everyday shopping for small amounts of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe says stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight discount retailers like Aldi and Lidl with better service and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores and also introduced a number of Habitat divisions, which are chains that it bought two years ago, which has increased food sales and made acquisitions even more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments ended in disgrace.
At the turn of the millennium, Sainsbury's was testing a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of proceeds from the sale of the drugs in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies for £125 million three years ago to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds chain of pharmacies.
Lloyds is planning to play its part by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands to its four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer, said: "We have changed the look and style of the cosmetics aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be able to advise customers.
Our range of brands should meet all needs, and the enticing environment and convenient location mean that we now represent an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change old ways of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of her £11 million contract.
The star of Dragons Day, Peter Jones, is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of Trula homewear and accessories.
The couple's business has been compared to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of the show announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons Day star Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her big new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to informed sources, Jones was furious when the TV star, in a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, admitted that he would no longer be able to devote enough time to their Trula brand of homewear and accessories due to new contracts worth up to £1.5 million.
The business has been compared to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and could double the fortune of presenter Willoughby to an estimated £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones set off from Britain for one of her summer residences.
The unnamed source reports that Trula's badge was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which would secure her for decades to come.
Her decision to leave was a complete shock to all involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
There's a stockpile of merchandise ready for sale at the Marlow headquarters.
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning host, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, given the heavy investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings and the potential for further delay in branding.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for the past decade.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Couples are on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become an M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business affairs".
♪ Hard negotiations ♪ ♪ And then we fell in love ♪
He joked about the criticism he's getting from the press for what some consider to be "unfit remarks" by the president and for speaking positively about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded with his ridiculous voter voice.
I'm not giving up on anything.
He noted that after Trump praised their June 1st meeting in Singapore as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is keen to meet again.
But the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, prominent North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "responsible" response from the United States to its first steps toward disarmament.
Instead, the US continues sanctions, which are designed to increase pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
That would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - ending missile tests, helping to free hostages and returning the remains of American troops to their homeland.
And defended his unusual approach to reporting on his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's residents have been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a necessary prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
'In many cases, they have unfortunately made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is a bit difficult,' says Ms Sumbung.
Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, but it's not clear if foreign staff can work there.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr. Sutupo, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paulo to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Because of the frequent occurrence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still woefully unprepared for Mother Nature's wrath.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not common in other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Paulo, even after the warning was issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of times, traveling between many of Indonesia's islands is problematic.
And when natural disasters strike, the logistics are even more difficult.
A hospital ship that anchored in Lombok and helped earthquake victims is now moving to Paulo, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure was a major focus of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
He's running for re-election next year, but his government is plagued by funding cuts.
President Joko is also facing pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority are adopting a more conservative form of religion.
Street fights between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people and displaced tens of thousands.
Look at Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge, who scored the equaliser against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday to save Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team lost 1-0.
He switched the ball to the left and fired at the far pole.
The shot was flying high and aimed at the top right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually passed the bouncing Kepu Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming towards me, so I didn't think much about it and fired at the touch of a gun".
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half-time after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward sent the pass back to Mate Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the field and sprinted to half Liverpool.
Kovacic passed the ball quickly.
Then he sent the ball down a beautiful alleyway to Hazard in the lime.
He ran defensively and left to end up on the far pole next to Alyson Becker of Liverpool.
On Wednesday at 3:00pm, Liverpool will play the home team in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play at 3pm on Thursday in London with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Authority, as of Sunday morning.
The 7.5 magnitude quake struck on Friday, triggering waves as high as 20 feet and trapping many people in the rubble of collapsed buildings, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the office, at a press conference.
The city of Paulo, with a population of over 380,000, was littered with debris.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning, and police immediately launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7.55am at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking people in the area who have seen or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says the investigation is just beginning, but I would appeal to anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I'm also asking anyone, especially taxi drivers whose cab cameras could have picked up anything to contact us because they may have information that's important to our investigation,
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman was a resident of Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
Friends arrived at the scene this afternoon, who think they know the woman, to ask where she was found this morning.
Police said they are investigating and are now informing the victims' relatives.
A cabbie who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents have now been told it will be several hours before they can return home.
One man was told by a police officer that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene, crying.
He keeps saying, "This is terrible".
At 2pm, two police vans were behind the tape and another was waiting outside.
There's a line of cops in the gated area, watching the house.
Anyone with any information can send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and enter code 247 dated September 30.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament has recently become a hit due to the controversy over the "rewrite of history".
His banishment would be a deserved punishment for his fanatical, Taliban-style Puritan followers destroying a lot of English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr Crick's proposal "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, says: "In the ongoing debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that one of the targets would be the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order or carry out iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th-century view and a part of the historiography of a figure that many still think deserves to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people regard Cromwell, though today a little less than at the end of the 19th century, as the defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, from the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of relentless historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
The killer pig tore up the Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig farmer was attacked and killed in a market in southeast China.
As reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday, a man named only as Yuan was found dead with an aorta cut in a pool of blood near a barbecue in the market in Liu-phan-shui, Quzhou province.
A pig farmer is preparing to administer the vaccine to pigs in pigs' pen on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly arrived with a cousin from the neighboring province of Jün-nan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next crib open.
He said there was a big pig in the cage with a bloody mouth.
According to the information, the forensic examination confirmed that a 250kg pig tore the farmer apart.
"The cousin's legs were all bloody and torn", the Guiyang Evening News quoted the cousin, who is referred to by the surname "Wu".
CCTV footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so that no one else would be attacked while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Market officials are reportedly negotiating with Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
Although pig attacks on humans are rare, they have happened in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, critically injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had squeezed a Welsh farmer to a tractor and was chased away by the farmer's wife.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States .
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken and move over the cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the coming days, it will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. eastern time, Rosa reached wind speeds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 miles southeast of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure vortex is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward to the U.S. west coast, and as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and begin pushing tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain on Monday.
Tropical humidity, with a low pressure ridge approaching, will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest of the United States over the next few days.
Rainfall of 25 to 100 mm will locally cause dangerous tidal flooding, mudflows and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall to approach 50 to 75 mm per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some places in the southwest US, especially over most of Arizona, are expected to see 50 to 100 mm of rain.
Rapidly deteriorating conditions can result in flash floods due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
Given the dangers of tropical precipitation, it would be very unwise to go into the desert on foot.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to become raging rivers, and storms can bring local gusty winds and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure ridge will bring heavy local precipitation to parts of the Southern California coast.
Overall precipitation of more than 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller debris flows and slippery pavements.
It will be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
On Sunday evening and Monday morning, a rare tropical storm will begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday evening and Tuesday, rain will spread.
Tuesday's heavy rainfall will spread to the Four Corners and last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic begins to cool, but the tropics will still be quite warm.
This sometimes results in sudden temperature changes over short distances.
A great example of the dramatic temperature difference is the central United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a difference of almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they'll try again to spread the summer heat.
A warm start to October is expected in most of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures around 27 °C from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
It could be 27 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh hearings were watched by over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels Thursday's stirring testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980's.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, and broadcasters interrupted regular programming with news of a sudden twist Friday: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100% sure that Kavanaugh touched her at a high school party while drunk and tried to strip her dress.
Kavanaugh said in his emotional statement that he was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that the event was watched by more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen.
The company calculated average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers for other stations that broadcast the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who are looking in offices.
By comparison, that's the same number of people watching a football game in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest viewership of any station, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearings, according to Nielsen.
The second was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, and that the network had a total of 2.9 million viewers.
Interest persisted after the negotiations had ended.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras captured him on Friday morning being yelled at by protesters as he was about to take the elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
CNN was live, and he stood there for a few minutes with his eyes closed and he let them swear at him.
One woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you".
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
And I heard, saying, Thou hast power, and many women are weak.
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before the elevator doors closed, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and cable networks later broadcast live when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to submit Kavanaugh's nomination to a full Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI by next week, which was the minority demand of the Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's vote was important because it was clear that without an investigation, the Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of "political" Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "speaking about Britain's future and undermining national interests".
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview that was close to the one with the Prime Minister on the front page, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to levy their tariffs on each other was "completely nonsensical".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police have arrested Dytone Simpson, who is suspected in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
Baton Rouge Police Department said that Dyteon Simson, 20, has been arrested and detained on a charge of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson confronting each other, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to WABF, which is part of CBS, police recovered the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
Police say Simpson confessed to shooting Wayde after questioning.
According to the defense, bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge coroner's office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Refugee Police Department, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police Department and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "shrewdness and efforts to bring justice".
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-9 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU,
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that Wayde's death by the team shocked and shocked him.
"This is what you're always afraid of", Wade said.
The volcano is spewing ash over Mexico City
Ashes from the Popacatepetl volcano have hit the southern part of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after volcanic activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center has been monitoring a series of tremors and tremors.
Images of car windshields covered in a thin layer of ash have appeared on social media in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in activity at the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with law enforcement, and thousands of people joined competitive demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the independence vote that divided Catalonia.
The police blocked a group of masked separatists who were throwing eggs and powdered paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, fights broke out, which the police had to calm down with batons.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in the face of protesting unionists who shouted "Long live Spain".
According to local media, 14 people were slightly injured during the protests.
One year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but which separatist Catalans celebrate, tensions remain high in the region's independence-seeking region.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but turnout was low as anti-secessionists boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting at polling stations in violent clashes across the region.
Pro-independence groups stayed out Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was done, but she had to choose a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's independence.
We had some of the best times last year.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we're in a dead end, he said.
Despite an important, even narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have had to fight to keep things going this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either going into exile themselves or awaiting trial in custody for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on her phone, saying the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense", he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison since the end of last year awaiting trial, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
'Candidating for the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression we are witnessing from the Spanish government,' he said.
Men arrested after car crashed into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after they repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, the car may have been shot from a stake.
Meng's shot secured a 1-0 win for Livingston over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston, who had been promoted from the lower division, shocked Rangers, conceding only Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved decisive as Gary Holt's team reached the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side have yet to win a premiership on home soil this season and next Sunday they face Hearts for the first time, losing by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has extended his unbeaten run in the division to six games, so head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has yet to experience a defeat.
Livingston against the unremarkable guests did not take chances
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the goal, because his straightness caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but failed to get to the gate, then Alan Lithgow slipped just short of Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
The home team just watched the Rangers play in front of them, because they knew they could trouble the guests with standard situations.
And then came the key goal.
Against Rangers, a free kick was ordered and Livingston made a hole, Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly sent Mengo, who ran the ball in the middle of the penalty area and scored.
At this stage, Rangers were dominating in possession, but home defence was impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly out of work.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's legs and Lithgow missed another standard Livingston situation.
Centers were constantly flying into Livingston's penalty area, which the players were cleaning up, and two penalty kicks were also thrown after Halkett's attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and another by hand.
The Livingston phenomenon is an analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a result for Livingston.
They have been exceptionally excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and the squad have hardly changed since their return to the top, but much credit goes to Holt for how he's been rocking the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was formidable, leading a well-organized defense while keeping Meng on the alert all along, Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers are lacking inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they're not up to that standard anymore.
Their finish was poor, they only made it to the home side once, and it should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, because they're in the middle of the board.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29), the sky was blue and everyone was smiling.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to mend ties between NATO allies.
They disagreed on a range of issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented the 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters appeared in the area wanting to see their president.
Hundreds of people - many of them Kurds - were also heard protesting against Erdogan, condemning his policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The counter-protests reflect the controversial nature of the visitor, who was hailed as a hero by some German Turks and vilified as an autocrat by others.
Deptford accident: cyclist killed after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died after a car crash.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and busy Evelyn Street in Deptford on the city's southeast side.
The driver stopped the car and soon an ambulance arrived, but the man was dead at the scene.
The death comes just months after another cyclist died about a mile from the scene of Saturday's tragedy in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street.
Metropolitan Police said officers are now trying to identify the man and notify his relatives.
The road is closed, buses are running on alternate routes, and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in the riots at the high-security men's prison.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9:30 local time and are still ongoing.
Specialist guards from the Tornado team were called in to handle the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated at the scene.
A prison spokesman said, "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to handle the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and it's clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer behind bars.
Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison director had resigned after an attack on a prisoner at the hospital.
And last October, security forces were called to the prison for a serious riot in which the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's not unusual for a low-pressure tropical storm to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa will overtake the desert southwest, bringing the risk of tidal flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities like Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained tropical storm status or pressure lows!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 50 to 100 millimeters, in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona, in places up to 150 millimeters.
Other areas of the desert northwest, including the middle Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to experience 25 to 50 mm of rainfall, with local totals of up to 100 mm.
For those not threatened by tidal flooding, the rain from Rosa can be a blessing, for the area has been hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious thing, but these rains might help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States just hit a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least "extreme drought", the second highest category.
The path of Hurricane Rosa will first lead to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still hurricane-force with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, will then be 620 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, on Sunday morning, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
Then the storm meets the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus loses its strength.
It's expected to make landfall in Mexico Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall will present a high risk of flooding.
In the area from Baja California to northwest Sonora, total rainfall is expected to be between 75 and 150 mm, with up to 250 mm occurring, according to weather.com.
Rosa then travels north as a tropical storm across Mexico, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, then crossing Arizona and entering southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or its remnants is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States", reports the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause deadly tidal floods and landslides in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 a.m. local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is now stable.
According to Avon and Somerset Police, the young men, aged between 17 and 20, were arrested in the area of Radstock overnight.
Police are looking for witnesses who might have a cell phone recording of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh has experienced the wickedness and wrath of the Democratic Party
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the reckless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump has said that Kavanaugh "experienced the viciousness and anger of the Democratic Party" during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at her arraignment hearing.
The president said Saturday that on that day, Americans had witnessed Kavanaugh's greatness and quality and courage.
He told his West Virginia supporters that the vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh was a confirmation of one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a record of outstanding public service.
The president was making a direct reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans running in midterm elections.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm always on the move, he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.
Trump has declared that the Democrats have opted for "resistance and obstruction".
A Republican Party adviser told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the floor of the Senate is expected no later than Friday.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds, and the death toll is still rising
Authorities announced Saturday that after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of them swept away by huge waves that flooded beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered for the festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, but at dusk, waves as high as 20 feet [20 m] hit the coast, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami wave was preceded by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and didn't immediately flee, so they fell victim to the waves", said BNPB Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave didn't come alone, it took cars, buildings, houses, hit everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coast, the tsunami wave was spreading at 800 km/h on the open sea.
He said that some people fled to the trees before the wave and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Mitigation Agency show many destroyed buildings and businesses, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The effects shook the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful tremors was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could have magnified the tsunami wave.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of casualties and damage could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
He said that communication was completely crippled without any information from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse", the statement said.
The agency faced considerable criticism on Saturday for failing to report that Palu had been hit by a tsunami wave, even though authorities said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building screaming desperately to warn people on the street of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, the coastline will be hit by a wall of water that will wash away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the record.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for aid only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived in the city of Paulu, where employees are sheltering in cellhouses built in the courtyard of an office building, they saw images of destruction along the way, says Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he adds.
It's too bad.
When relief groups embarked on their sad disaster relief work, some complained that experienced foreign workers were not allowed to come to São Paulo.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funding, supplies, and personnel can only flow to the disaster site once a national disaster zone has been declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says "OK, this is a national disaster", we can start international aid, but that's not the situation yet.
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in São Paulo unfolded, friends and relatives of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would ease the gloomy stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under debris next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding team, was training two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended in Indonesia this month.
Other people imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As someone who has been involved in paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden", he says.
Mr. Gendon described how, in the hours following the parachuting community's knowledge of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to the Palu competitors attending the beach festival.
But instead of two blue ticks, his messages ended in a gray mark.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered", he says.
Thieves took $26,750 while refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee Friday morning while refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
According to the report, Detective Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the car was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to put more money into it.
While he was doing this, another man ran out behind the employee of Brink and stole a bag of money that was to be put into an ATM.
Witnesses reported seeing several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
If you have any information about the identity of any suspects, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, writing: "Being formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the nickname Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is set to unveil his new album Yandhi.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for emotional reasons, according to the show's creator.
West has said before that the word has a religious meaning to him in addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name.
"In my opinion, ye is the most used word in the Bible, meaning ty", West was heard talking about his album earlier this year with radio host Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It's changed from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are.
A number of other famous rappers have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator JAY-Z also alternated between spelling his name with and without a hyphen and in upper and lower case.
Mexican President AMLO has promised not to use the military against civilians
On the upcoming 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students, newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
As the leftist student movement spread throughout Latin America, on October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in a public square, killing as many as 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly stipends to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence
According to AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government released announcements about AI, even though the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China last year rolled out a plan to be the world's number one AI innovator by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are far beyond the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI", says Lee.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chance that the next big AI breakthrough will be made in the United States.
Lee, who published his book "The Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the '80s, he worked on an AI system that beat out the top American player in the game of Othello, and later he was a senior research officer at Microsoft and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when there would be another one to help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants, says Lee.
"The academic elite are not being led away by China, but by corporations", Lee says.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been hiring the best experts from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Changes in immigration policy could also help the United States improve its AI efforts, Lee said.
"I think AI PhDs should be automatically offered a green card", he says.
The State Council of China issued the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Board and other government organizations give money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is worse, Lee says.
The U.S. Department of Defense this year established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it's investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's now investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
But the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, had been sitting idle for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory, and therefore has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will weaken the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gyorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the required minimum of 50 percent of voters will be present for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries to the former Yugoslavia, to join organisations like the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", says Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough members of parliament have said they will follow the results of the vote.
A name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no problems were reported until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the Macedonian referendum on changing the name to open the country's path to NATO and the European Union, in Strumice, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and pulls out chairs in front of tents set up by people who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads held high, not through the door for servants", says Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said the result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, the referendum could see between 30 and 43 percent of voters participate, which is less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, it must be reduced by 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would mark the first serious blow to the policies of a pro-Western government since it took office last May.
Look, Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has gone through the whole Brighton defence for a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took down Brighton's defence on Saturday, securing a 2-0 win for Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero's delivery looked ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
It all started with a pass the Argentine forward got in the middle of the field.
He sprinted through three Brighton defenders and got into the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
On the outskirts of Brighton penalty area, he bypassed one defender and overtook several others.
The next pass to the left, he found Sterling.
The English striker kicked the ball in the penalty area back to Aguer, who with his right hand overtook Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
Aguero has leg problems, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We thought he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's how it was.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
The Sky Blues' initial lead in this Premier League game was secured by Sterling.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory.
On the left, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to the remote pole.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net just before he slipped off the field.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12:55.
Scherzer wants to ruin the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from playoff contention, there wasn't much reason to re-enter.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies... if and only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, have a chance to make the playoffs.
The Rockies at least secured a wild card victory Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they're still looking to win their first division title.
Even if we're not playing for anything, we can at least get a head start, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing, and the other team is going to be playing with probably the most effort I'm going to experience this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in it?
The Nationals haven't announced who's starting Sunday, but they're reportedly leaning toward Scherzer's pitching in a situation like this.
It would be Scherzer's 34th start, and he'd be training Thursday and pitching Sunday, when he's usually off.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 this season with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump speaks at a rally in West Virginia
The president was indirectly commenting on the situation surrounding his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to participate in midterm elections.
November will be the stake of everything we've accomplished.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones. I'm not running, but we're always on the move, and I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump continued: "You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power by any means necessary, you see the villainy, the abomination.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overthrow to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
He said the Democrats have decided to "resist and obstruct".
And you've seen it in the last four days, he added, saying that the Democrats are angry and mean and disgusting and lying.
He mentioned the name of the oldest member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud roar from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document out?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait. That was really bad body language. The worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse political party.
He is intolerant of those who express their opinions
When the activists from Momenta in my local party voted for my reminder, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a long line of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome because they have spoken their minds honestly.
My fellow MP, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized in the admonition for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on paradoxically similar issues, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday said that we want the meetings to be accessible and productive.
For most of the eight years that I've been a local Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, most meetings don't happen these days, and the promise of a kinder, kinder politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each view is being assessed as acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues who I thought had similar political views suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and take positions that I would otherwise not agree with, whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public  and it doesn't matter what I say  then there's a barrage of social media abuse calling for my resignation, condemning the politics of the centre and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I respect the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but never give in.
One of the aspects of this era of politics that I'm most disappointed in is how insults have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse opinion stream, and with every motion of no confidence or change in the election rules, the party becomes more limited.
I've been told many times over the last two years to stay back, not to talk so much, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the negligence of Margaret Thatcher's government, which had my primary school class literally disbanded, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would say only that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will hurt our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my main message is not to the Nottingham Moment, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political pragmatism will deter me from acting in what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38  17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two late fifths slightly skewed the final score, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team.
In the end, it was the excellent defense and the better use of the chances that helped the home team win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"In our matches we have been through great trials and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says, "All the credit to Ayra, they took a better chance than we did".
A 14th-minute five by Grant Anderson, converted by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scotland international Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot to take an unchanged five.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty and then, right in the half, he scored and turned the solo attempt, so he adjusted it to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's five, converted by Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
Then followed a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the pitch on stretchers, and when play resumed, Ayr bounced again thanks to a fifth by Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Deputy captain Ayra Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again used the extra player thanks to an unchanged fifth by Bruce Colvin after a short strong push.
The home side returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given the yellow for attacking Clim without a ball, MacPherson from the penalty box put the ball behind the advancing mule Ayra.
Climo turned, again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth home run.
Still Game star starts a new career in the hospitality industry
It seems that the star of the series Still Game Ford Kieran is moving into the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he writes and stars in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' final, and it seems Kiernan is already planning her life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the report, but a source in the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan was keen to get involved in a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Inland Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors stand guard outside the naval headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with rope.
A blue flag in the color of the ocean is flying over public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are described by the slogan: "The sea is ours by right".
It is our duty to get it.
All over inland Bolivia there is still a vivid memory of the coastline the country lost to Chile in the bloody war for resources in the 19th century  as well as the desire to re-fence the Pacific Ocean.
These desires may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice, which is due on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and calm and, of course, expects a positive outcome", says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the MSD decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that  after many decades of interrupted talks  Chile is obliged to negotiate for Bolivia to be granted sovereign access to the sea.
Charismatic indigenous Bolivian President Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, is also keen on Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he declared at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia  and even if it did, it would not change much.
This Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to assign Chilean territory to anyone and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the MSD decision comes just six months after the last arguments were presented shows that the case "wasn't complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the last four years have not only not supported the cause of Bolivia, but perhaps have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian government", says Zarate.
He adds that Morales's offensive rhetoric has weakened all remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will start talking again, but after this, it will be extremely difficult to have a discussion.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements", he said.
Calzadilla also refused to allow Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - to use the sea issue as a political bargaining chip.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to deal with the past".
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless the United States can trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first unless it can trust Washington
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made at the summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has been stuck at a stalemate for more than three months for the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says he is "planning hopes" that the ongoing sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration ending the Korean War could eventually bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes decisive steps to disarm.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
There is general skepticism, however, that Pyongyang is serious about giving up this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show shows that the latest trend of huge headgear is coming to your fashion stores soon
If you want to expand your hat collection or block out the sun altogether, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of twisted giant headgear for their 2019 spring/summer collection at a show that captivated everyone at Paris Fashion Week.
Very uncomfortable hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their exciting creations to the pier.
Valentino's exhibit was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide rim resembling feathers that flooded the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories were ornate watermelons, a witch's hat, and even pineapples - but they are not meant to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creature resembled scuba gear with a snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a cornucopia with melted ice cream.
And if you keep up with the huge fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that giant hats could also be found in fashion stores.
The grown-up hats come for La Bomba, a straw with a half-meter wide clamp that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski wore.
The iconic brand behind this highly impractical hat that has flooded social media has sent another giant creation to the fairgrounds: a straw beach bag that's almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that carries it.
A dark orange raffia bag lined with raffia bands and fitted with a white leather handle was the exhibit piece of the La Riviera Spring/Summer 2019 collection by Jacquemuse at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for next summer. Given the success of the designer with them, it would be hard to ignore the demand for overly large accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are a must for global citizens
The Scottish Independent Schools have a track record of academic achievement, which continues in 2018 with further excellent test results, individual and group successes in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
These schools have over 30 000 pupils across Scotland, are represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS) and strive to provide the best possible level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As the education sector can design and implement tailored school curricula, we see that modern languages are increasingly popular and in demand in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language they understand, it goes right to their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart.
It's a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we can't rely on English alone.
The latest results of this year's tests show that languages are at the top of the charts, with independent schools having the lowest achievement rates.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language scored the highest A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that the highest A scores were achieved by 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects of choice are given equal weight in the curricula of independent and other schools as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A survey carried out by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that the reasons employers cite as problems in filling vacancies are 17 per cent lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly becoming essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more job opportunities require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career a person chooses, learning a second language will have the real advantage of being a lifelong skill in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically gives a person who speaks more than one language an advantage over the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with the only language spoken by the double-digit percentage of people, 15 percent, being French.
That's why it's important for children today to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially those of emerging economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages considered to be the most important for the UK in the 2020 outlook, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child's interest, independent schools will always have a choice of languages with teachers who are experts in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing an educational environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
At this point, there is no denying that languages are essential to the future of a country in a global business environment, and that this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as international communication skills
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It must be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will be making his first appearance in the Lakers jersey Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James' first-ever appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers are about to get their hands on it.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason game in San Diego against the Denver Nuggets.
It's not clear how many minutes it's gonna be.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after practice, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games", he said.
Trump's speech in West Virginia, the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is opening a wave of campaign speeches tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the suspension of the vote to confirm his nominee for the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in the November elections.
What time does Trump's speech start tonight, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 PM Eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below via a live YouTube stream.
Trump is likely to be referring to the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's highly-tense hearing this week on sexual misconduct charges, which is expected to delay the Senate confirmation vote by a week until the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of this wave of rallies is to help the Republicans pick up the pace before the November election.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign organizers say the five rallies next week are intended to "empower volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House".
"Control of the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible during this busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not wish to be named, told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling today could be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and could be watched by the media in Pittsburgh.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey who is falling behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come and help him with his investigations", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed it's stomach to fight to keep hope ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided matches, Saturday's pair may be just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely made-up sporting concept, but players really believe in it, and especially in competitions like this.
So where does the pendulum swing now?
"They're six points ahead and now they're four, so we're taking it that the pendulum is probably moving a little bit towards us", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead and 12 to go.
As Spieth says, Americans feel like they've got a little bit of wind in their sails, and there are a lot of things that can cheer them up, like the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and each boasting three points out of four.
Spieth was lethal in the switch from the starting line to the green and is setting an example.
The cheers intensified as his lap continued as he managed a key patch to win the entire match, as he and Thomas were two holes behind.
His putt, which won them a 15-hole game, was met with a similar roar, which tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game", said Spieth.
That's all any of these players left behind.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple from Europe are four out of four and can do no wrong.
"Moliwood was the only couple who didn't hit the hole on a Saturday afternoon, but missed it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning".
The course and the way the energy flows both towards and from the tumultuous crowd confirms that these are the players destined for Sunday's victory, and that by sunset over Le Golf National there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in a different hole.
But talk of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly worked with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning game with four balls, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The pit and two dables on the front nine have buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a chasm from which they never climbed again.
But on Sunday, no one will be able to help you.
Two-on-two-ball games are so fascinating when you watch closely the interactions of people in pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the last day, but this two-two game also showed that the US team has a stomach for fighting that some, especially from the states, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a healthy advantage until the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's two-ball match, with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly nearly beat wrestler Tiger Woods twice, decided to make four cuts at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the morning's two-ball games with the American side, who lost the series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, won two games, but couldn't get into the deficit.
Jim Fury's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a two-ball game, they still beat tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more decisively 5&4.
Woods, who had two games on Saturday, showed occasional glimmers of brilliance, but now has lost 19 of his 29 games in a two-for-two, seven-in-a-row game.
Justin Rose, rested after the morning's two-ball game, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a 2&1 doubles match defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the world's No. 1 and No. 3 ranked players.
Europe, however, was not in a position to win on this pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris.
Triple major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a tough 2&1 victory over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and returned later to beat the pair Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a pair game, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit to a double, although as the defending Furyk side only needs a draw to claim the trophy.
After the second day was their best in two days, it seems Sunday's counterattack is behind them.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally and without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that continued U.N. sanctions have deepened their distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and promising not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see an adequate response from the US", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there can be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, it is impossible to unilaterally disarm".
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization, whereby North Korea would be rewarded for each step, his statement seemed significant in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization simply because Pyongyang had gone through it in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the release of tough international sanctions against North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearization first and is increasing pressure on sanctions to enforce its goals, even objecting to the end of the war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who know nothing about us.
The problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the denuclearization issue had been between South Korea and the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a standstill".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's targeting of missiles on US soil was inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim a missile man on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea was completely denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying: "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue forcefully and without cease and desist until we realize complete, final, verified denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly side by side, and Pompeo said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't end well.
He left Pyongyang in July, claiming progress had been made, only to be declared by North Korea within hours to be making "gangster demands".
North Korea has pledged to meet Moon this month to dismantle the missile site as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he hopes to achieve are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to teach them about getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has made all of its students sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture of studying all night long, where students stay awake and are stimulated by caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world's most prestigious university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had been seriously sleep-deprived for a week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One part is a picture of college campuses where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers, and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that student behavior won't change overnight.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes", Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of "all-night study" still exists, he added, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is also growing.
Getting enough quality sleep should be the student's secret weapon to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even to prevent weight gain, because sleep deprivation puts the brain into a hunger mode, so you're always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that one of his classes took last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the whole course.
He hopes to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar programme of study before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised students to consider setting the alarm for when to go to bed as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can alter your circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers, the goal of Menong has sunk Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss when a hit by Dolly Menga confirmed Steven Gerrard's displeasure with a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox were looking to record their first win since the 4-1 February triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused only Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from leading Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes into the half and the Rangers squad seemed to be without inspiration and determination to tie.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston climbs to third and just behind the Hibernian team by one goal.
And there could be more problems for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently being hit by an object from the stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to his side, who overtook Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was going with the same Livi 11 that took the Hearts point last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team smothering their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have controlled the hold, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were due to score just two minutes into the game when Mengo first let Scott Pittman through to Alan McGregor's goal, but the full-back buried his big shot.
Keagan Jacobs' long free kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only attempt at the back of the net.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed like there was more hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have a quarter-hour penalty when he faced Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson swept the Colombian challenge off the table.
Rangers managed just two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was surprised by a headshot from Lassana Coulibaly and a soft shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener after 34 minutes could have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they've earned it for their hard work.
The Rangers failed to get a deep set of Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took Mengo for an easy finish.
Gerrard took over at halftime and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the trade had almost immediate effect when the wing crashed into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly fought his way through the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to bring the visitors into the game exactly the kind they like, with Lithgow and Halkett throwing one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have deepened their lead in the closing stages, but McGregor stood well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
Rangers alternate Glenn Middleton had another late penalty call when he got tangled up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
The inventors of the Geiger reader
And now the page from our almanac: "Sunday morning, September 30, 1882", today is 136 years ago, and still more... the day on which the future German physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger reader.
The Geiger Counter became a pop culture center, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What the hell is that?
It's a Geiger reader used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals.
Yeah, he's really going for it now.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to see dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see dangerous cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and transforming them in the laboratory
Then they can see a protein that's common to many cancers, and then they can re-inject it.
The experimental vaccine is showing promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells had her ovarian cancer gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, transforming them in the lab so they can see a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting it into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine".
HER2 regulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, whereby immune cells were taken from patients and trained to target cancer cells, had already been used in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West attended a pro-Trump sermon, wearing his magic hat, after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was booed on Saturday Night Live after a disruptive performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, "Ghost Town", in which he wore his Make America Great Again hat, he started spitting on the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump when he's a racist?"
If I was concerned about racism, I wouldn't be in America, he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a parody starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the alleged rape of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's theatrical speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that his headgear got eaten up backstage.
I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat".
This is bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "You want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would put on his Superman suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love.
His comments earned nothing but a roar from the audience at least twice, and members of SNL looked outraged, embarrassed, Variety reports, and one person even said, "The whole studio went silent".
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many in attendance by singing the song I Love dressed up for a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from TPUSA's conservative group leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous characters: THANK YOU FOR BEING A DAVU".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "simply who he is, and that's absolutely amazing".
But I will NOT reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or by supporting their art) who I believe represents and broadcasts an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free to go.
Just like us", she added.
Before the performance, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly named Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to the symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was killed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The indictment is under review by the state's attorney's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has turned to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the HBO series Violent Medieval Fantasy.
The 31-year-old actor, however, has stepped back from the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that such screen roles mean young boys often feel they have to be tough to earn respect.
He told The Sunday Times Culture Kit that he believed something was wrong and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Star of the Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted to being "quite vocal" about the problem.
"At this moment I personally feel, quite strongly - what has happened so wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What are we teaching teenage boys about the problem we see here?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is learned?
What do boys learn on TV, on the streets, that they feel the need to have a page for every man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because young men have certainly changed for the worse.
He also admitted in an interview that he will not be appearing in any Game of Thrones prequel or sequel after the series is over, as he is fed up with "Battle and Horse".
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's reboot of The Wild West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose was the best thing that ever came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the set of the show, so he gave me my future family and my whole life after that", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of Kit's affection as Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Official figures show that more than 820,000 people in the country are infected with the virus.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40 000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which was a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread through parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who are infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people per year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases transmitted come from inadequate sexual protection during these interactions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff have leaked GOP senators' data, citing the terms "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory".
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned the allegation that a member of her staff sent the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' wikis.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the accusations were backed by far-right scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on the sexual abuse allegation by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that the posts originated from is linked to Waters' office and has published information on Waters' staff members, Hill says.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters's statement quickly earned online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry", wrote Fleischer.
That suggests he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
He must not be defiant.
He must not question the prosecution's motives.
He must be calm and not get excited.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who ran against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions, which are devastating and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff".
Johnny English again hits the reviews with a weaker spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It's become commonplace to look for Brexit in every new British-themed film, which seems to be the case with this revival of Johnny English in a series of action parodies - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this outrageous satire on how obviously bad a nation we are be our new export opportunity?
Anyway, this perverted, incompetent, rubber-faced Johnny English had his license to repackage things in a whole new way -- that name more than anything else with a signal that it's a broad comic creation intended for a non-English speaking cinematic audience.
He's, of course, the dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and a big bite of the guy who played the one note in the Chariots of Fire theme song at the 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony.
The character is also originally based on the traveller and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercials Barclaycard, who left behind a mess.
There's one or two good things about this latest issue of J.E.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly squeaked on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but humor feels quite understated and strangely redundant, especially when "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a component of their productions.
The humor is more like it's meant for children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's crazy tramps are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie gags in the person of Mr. Bean.
The constant assumption is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's super-secret spy web and revealed the identities of all British agents in the field, much to the consternation of an agent in the service - too small a role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and self-absorbed figure who is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays this Theresa May-like character to her best, but there's not much in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that once every active spy is compromised, she'll have to put someone back on the job.
That means Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director in some luxury facility, but also gives record-breaking lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are some nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to Rock School.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his long-suffering former partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man living with a submarine commander, a sentimental figure who may be wasting some of Vicki Pepperdine's talent.
So Batman and Robin, in the middle of a mission for Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action and meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer crime: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of farcical mishaps: masquerading as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; creating chaos as they sneak aboard the Volt's luxury yacht; and English unleashing pure anarchy as they attempt to use virtual reality to explore the interior of the Volt's home.
I'm sure all the aces are ready for this final sequence, but as self-indulgent and as violent as she is, she has a little bit of a children's TV in her.
It's a moderate matter.
And like with all of Johnny English's films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly matched his talent?
Labour denies they would develop a plan for Englishmen to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan whereby Britons will work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the bosses of companies to pass on to workers the savings that will result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would fit into the party's economic agenda and plans to favor the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day workweek was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A long-standing Labour member told the Sunday Times: "An evaluation of the measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is a wish that fits into the party's stance on balancing the economy in favour of workers and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party having promised a four-day work week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not our party policy and the party does not take it into account".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's working conference to fulfill his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell has declared his commitment to bringing back the energy of the anonymous CEOs and scientists at the utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not have to return to their overall stake, as the Labour government could make "cutbacks" based on perceived wrongdoing.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to create ownership funds that would transfer 10% of the equity of private enterprises to employees who are entitled to an annual dividend payment of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on 60 Minutes that the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising questions about whether the bureau's findings could sway any Republican senators in their campaign for their support.
In Sunday's 60 Minutes interview, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
I said I was going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.
Graham 's decision is unshakeable .
"Before Brett Kavanaugh, I've made my decision and it would mean a really explosive indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett has denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the annual Global Citizen Festival, which features a very impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, in its seventh year, welcomes tens of thousands of people to Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group that promotes ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now, 12 years before it reached its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a way to get them to demand action, or is it just another case of clicktivism -- people who feel that by signing an online petition or tweeting, they're making a difference?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million shares from its supporters since 2011, trying to achieve various goals.
He says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and measures worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group announced 390 commitments and notifications arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion had already been disbursed or financed.
The group estimates that the funds secured have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a UK partnership of investors and developers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", pledging $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice in the form of malnutrition a mere note in history", Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 events calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, asking, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "It's going to be a long and hard road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the performers at this year's New York show, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy for blockade to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington could use the Navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from entering markets including the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to channel energy just like in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe", he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to do this with the help of our navy to make sure that the sea lanes are open and if necessary blocked to make sure that their energy is not going to the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing participants at an event organized by the Consumers Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that is considered the "Voice of the Energy Consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they're basically the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less investment in or replacement of fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a "one-stop-shop" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and has replaced Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to back down from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "surrender" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US took a stand from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has urged the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to take a closer look at the 2020 presidential race, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that after the midterm elections, she'll be looking closely at running for president.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top female position", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'll be taking a closer look at the presidential race.
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm going to fight to the bone what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted that "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
But a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said a senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the nomination.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names being discussed in connection with a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD by Track Palin at his meeting with Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being listed in September.
Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through after his return, can relate to other families who are suffering from the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with", she told the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest the "elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back healed, they come back and ask if there's any respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military, give to their country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic assault on a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report, and carrying a weapon while intoxicated, said Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the call for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to new measures by the U.S. government that deny asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia in Washington, D.C., issued a brief statement Friday to support asylum seekers and challenge the measure, NBC reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said she was abused by her partner and his sons and members of a violent gang, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers for Grace's states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the US reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new measure "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle", said a brief friend.
The lawyers further argued briefly that a policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy and says they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide essential work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 statement.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious ones - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, where the death toll has already doubled, race against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation got worse and worse.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her feverish son at an evacuation center in the arid city of Palu.
Every minute, the ambulance will bring more bodies.
Clean water is precious.
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking through stuff and trying to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that were destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude quake were crippled.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting at Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he described the feeling of the violent earthquake shaking his fifth-floor hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was dragged into the rubble of the wall, "Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're okay.
US ambassador accuses China of harassment with propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper that focused on the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the paid subscription of China Daily to the Des Moines Register - the state's largest selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials said was the latest phase of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in an escalating trade war that manifests itself in the level of imports from each other.
China's retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China is now doubling down on this bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's precious traditions of free speech and a free press by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"Unlike a newsstand on a Beijing street, you will find limited dissent and you will see no real reflection of the inconsistent views that the Chinese might have on China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is owned by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had declined an offer to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are dropping their ballots ahead of the election over the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
As many top Republicans have defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, the analyst warned that they will see a response in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
Emotions around this case have been extremely high, and a majority of Republicans on record are already saying they want to continue the vote.
These things can't be turned back", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School.
Reeher said he doubts that Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will be able to reassure voters by pushing for an FBI investigation at the last minute.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, chief counsel and spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" at a rally in the Senate lobby where Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be record breaking", said Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst.
People say it was high, that's true.
However, it could be higher, especially among hesitant female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not like the president but often do not go to the polls.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault on a Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, resistance might follow.
"It's been a mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets to the chair, it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of U.S. priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, said, pointing to the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided on who to believe in light of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, with somewhat more sympathy for the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh, when he was drunk, attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party while he was a student at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet and overtake Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that's building on Berners-Lee's open source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of the Inrupt project is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of this startup.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data warehouse" or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and in all at once.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the aim of the Inrupt project is to bring the resources, processes and skills to help make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, some of the employees who work on the project, collaborated on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team at Facebook and Google are not talking about implementing a complete overhaul where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
Berners-Lee wrote in a media post published on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergyman who received the Victoria Cross during World War I
It's been a century since the only Anglican clergyman in history received the Victoria Cross as a war hero during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was killed by a sniper, and he never learned that he had been awarded Britain's highest military decoration.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone to him at a procession in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "geniusly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's victorious feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin in a very dense fog and heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
Later, he got to the front line and with the utmost courage, led the line forward before he threw himself into the firing field and knocked out three separate units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do, but at the same time something that is humiliating".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid the wreath after a parade conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was honoured to be part of the parade, adding that the courage of a true hero is shown by the support provided by many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got a piglet, Peppa.
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch a bloated Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 points, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5 all night.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their match, UK viewers were left stunned when the news shifted to Peppa Pig.
Some remained unmotivated after staying up until the early hours of the morning for the match.
One fan on Twitter described the change to a children's show as "a sure-fire form of bad joke".
"Government regulations do not allow for such content at 6 a.m. and therefore it is necessary to broadcast children's programmes", Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said after being asked about the broadcast.
Peppa Pig, yeah. I know.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they'll work on the programme to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think if I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it", said Cooker.
But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we can't make it to Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texting back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't. It was the government.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We're cutting it down to five games instead of six as we normally do, and we tried our best to keep our promise to the fans, and we couldn't.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt "undervalued" because of his sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality  but that motivated him to pursue success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he started high school that "not everyone is like him".
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that the possibility of becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The long-running talk show host Kirsty Young has been out of work for several months due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a scumbag in Lavern's first show, said he felt "less valuable" than anyone else who grew up with him because "it wasn't socially unacceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "So far, these feelings of inferiority and of being different have been the real things that have given me the strength and the power to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was somebody, said he didn't want to disappoint anyone who might find out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT rights activist and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he came because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with the husband of American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, caught him off guard.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who's 20 years his senior, last year, but he said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you experience so much at such a young age", he said, "he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died three years later of cancer". He said it was not easy to find someone his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, in June, and Daley said it changed his whole perspective.
"If you asked me last year, it would have been all about winning the gold medal", he said.
You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father was not comfortable with him dying, and the last thing he asked was if they had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be in the first row, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
The year after that, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I'd dreamed of it all my life", "jumping in front of our home crowd at the Olympics, I can't think of a better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his selection of his first song, "Flow by Heather Small", which resonated with him at the opening of the Olympics and still made him goose-skin.

Mickelson, who was out of shape, came off the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson would have set the record on Sunday with 47 Ryder Cup games, but he'd have to tune in to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Saturday Fourball and Foursome.
Instead of being the center of the action, as was often the case in the U.S., the five-time major winner spent his day alternating between cheerleading and working on a play in a sequence that he hoped would fix what was bothering him.
The 48-year-old has never been the most direct of drivers, even at the peak of his career, so he's not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National course, where the long, jagged terrain routinely punishes stray shots.
And if the golf course itself isn't alarming enough, Mickelson faces the ninth Sunday match against the defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who, in a team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, has won all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind, had started 12 separate swords, avoided a quick start, Mickelson's bat could have proved absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband and added nothing else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, he slapped me on the back, put his hand around my shoulder and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's so confident in himself.
He's a member of the Straw Syndicate, and he's been so helpful to these teams in the past and this week.
I guess I just couldn't imagine him playing two swords.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup Wests played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence has brought certain intangible results to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make fun of people, and he's a great team room companion", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun coming to him this week, which was fun to watch.
It's giving a lot more than just a game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the big lead in singles from the last few days in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they came into the final with a very close 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You have to remember that we had a big lead at Valderrama, as well as in Brooklyn where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won, but only narrowly", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 2018 season win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of that team showed me that we're not over.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until all those points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try and win the trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I said I'll focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand for on the other side.
Bjorn, pleased with the way his players were doing on the complex golf course, added: "I could never have done it alone.
We're gonna have another animal tomorrow.
Tomorrow is the preparation of individual performances, and it's very difficult.
It's great to be out with a partner when it's going well, but when you're out there on your own, your golfing ability is fully tested.
That's the message you have to give to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he has to go and get the best out of himself, too.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players play better as individuals than as partners, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great turning points, when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn, only to end up as the loser when Europe achieved the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players to focus on the final day.
Tomorrow we have 12 big games, but you'd like to start fast like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When this pace goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
So we set up the lineup and made sure the boys felt like, you know, like we were gonna do magic tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in a top-flight match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I went with this group of boys in this order, because I think it covers the whole way", Bjorn said of his singles selection.
German new warship still re-delayed
The newest German naval frigate was approved in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and a snow-covered coastline, local media report.
The launch of the lead ship, the Rheinland-Pfalz, a brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The vessel was to become part of the Navy in 2014, but difficult post-delivery problems have made the fate of this ambitious project unpleasant.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include long service life  it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside the home port.
But the constant delays mean that the high-end naval ships  that were supposed to enable Germany to send forces overseas  will be obsolete by the time they are commissioned, notes the newspaper Die Zeit.
The infamous F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had ever returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of major software flaws and defects in metal components that would render the warship unusable in combat.
The software flaws were particularly significant as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will be operated by a crew of some 120 seamen  half the workforce needed on the Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was significantly overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future innovation.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfal is believed to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defects in the metal components, the cost of the whole project  including the training of the crew is also a problem.
It is said that the price has risen from the original EUR 2.2 billion to a staggering EUR 3.1 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates have become particularly significant in light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the navy was indeed "finding ships fit for duty".
The representative stated that the problems were continuously being addressed as the old vessels were being decommissioned but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were capable of becoming part of the navy's equipment.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study is underway at a bat habitat in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings of the research will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities for this species.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow whistling and small-bodied bats, as well as brown long- and water-bates, at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas of this bat habitat to monitor bat activities throughout the year.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
A sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats' calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map and a report will be produced, which will create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and best practice in maintaining wooded areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across Britain have been declining dramatically over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and land development that affect colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by cats, can also pose a risk.
Bats aren't actually blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they hunt.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to track insects and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, check colonies, and sometimes even rescue work.
The organisation has even set up the first and only dedicated bat sanctuary at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Residence manager David Thompson says it's the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a great bat area", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees, and the best habitat.
But there's still so much we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.
It highlights the importance of bat control before any maintenance work is undertaken on the property, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of one breeding habitat can kill up to 400 females and young, potentially wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected, and it's illegal to kill them, harass them, disrupt or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to join in and help.
She said, "There's a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of species that we don't know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo denies rape charges and his lawyers are planning to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations "fake news" and said people "want to make themselves visible" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which reported on these allegations.
This Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the case, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Hours after the news of the allegations was released, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers, calling the news "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, I'm not going to do this.
"What they said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to live on my behalf.
That's what's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
"I'm happy and I'm fine", said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are planning to sue Der Spiegel on unsubstantiated charges that they have called "unacceptable disclosure of suspicions in the private sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damage" amounting to the severity of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times.
The alleged incident was said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the casino, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to court documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her he was 99% "delighted" and 1% "disappointed".
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had pictures taken of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was afraid of retaliation and feared public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman claims she is now seeking re-driving because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was a few steps away from joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack and was bought by the famous Italian club Juve for 100 million euros this summer.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the losses of car manufacturers
Britain will "ever regret" losing its status as the world's leading car maker after Brexit, said company secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"A deal is necessary", said Clark.
A Japanese carmaker said that the impact of delays at the borders if no Brexit deal is reached could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis cars are produced, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"My view is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would see a production shutdown at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, chief executive of Toyota in Burnston.
Other carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fears of a no-deal exit from the EU as far as the functioning of cross-border trade is concerned.
BMW, for example, is saying it will close its Mini car plant in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers describe as risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is running on a 'pretty on time' basis, with parts from suppliers in the UK and EU being delivered within 37 minutes for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts, according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have parts in stock for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus stop production.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plans to revive future relations with the EU were 'precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks'.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the opportunity to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The proof, not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely have to be able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains.
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would be halted, but warned that in the long term the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is the chairman of the unions at the plant, said that the members of the trade union organisations are increasingly concerned: I have experience that once these jobs are gone, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have put in place a precise and reliable roadmap for our future relations with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House reports
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with acting attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week as the Supreme Court battle with Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller's Special Counsel, which investigates Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the acting attorney general and threatens Mueller's independence, Washington's gossip has been rife for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump stated that he would rather not have Rosenstein dismissed, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh's testimony was being presented by one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, delaying the full Senate vote once again.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News Channel on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "No date has been set yet, it could be this week, maybe it will be postponed another week in view of everything else going on at the Supreme Court".
But we'll see, and I'll always keep the media up to date.
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders hasn't held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not due to "screen aversion" from television reporters, although she said, "I don't agree with the fact that she's going to speak".
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is holding more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she added, without citing evidence.
The conferences will continue, Sanders said, but if the press could ask the president of the United States directly, it would be better than interviewing me.
We're trying to do this, and you've seen that we've been doing this for the last few weeks, and there's going to be a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Independent press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre look in front of the assembled reporters.
Health Minister tells EU staff at NHS Scotland not to fear Brexit
The Health Minister has written to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and wishes they would stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, an SME, sent the letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to dealing with the costs of the claims for settlement of EU citizens working in the transferred public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "The UK and EU are continuing withdrawal negotiations throughout the summer, with a decision expected in the autumn of this year.
However, the UK Government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very upsetting time for all of you.
So I want to reassure you how much I appreciate the contributions of every staff member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and it is our heartfelt wish that you stay.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee Tigers outfielder Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there", Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline and then put him on a stretcher and prepared him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told Chrisz Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that no details are available as yet on the type/scale of injuries and that the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injuries occurred.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total interceptions before the game ended on Saturday, which makes a total of 18 interceptions for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher property tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when they buy property in the UK, with the extra money going to help the homeless under Tory's new plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move, which aims to attract young voters
The increase in the property tax will apply to non-taxable persons in the UK
It is expected to increase the national treasury by £ 120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will pay higher property taxes when they buy property in the UK, with the extra money used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and focus on high-income people.
The property tax increase will target individuals and businesses who do not pay UK taxes, with the extra money to bolster the government's efforts to combat sleepless nights.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current obligation to pay property tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchase for rental purposes, can reach up to three per cent.
It is estimated that the state treasury will be increased by up to £120 million a year.
Estimates say that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, driving down prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to climb the home ladder.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" precisely because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in property taxes to help more young people get their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing shortage".
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of exciting proposed housing reforms, including rental management and ending 'unusual' evictions.
He also wants to increase the authority of the committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I wanted to dedicate my efforts as Prime Minister to rebuilding the British dream so that every new generation has a better life.
And that means fixing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
But it cannot be right to make it easy for non-UK residents and foreign companies to buy homes as hard as hard-working UK residents.
For many people, the dream of a home is too distant and the shame of sleeping without a roof over one's head too real.
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to rule Scotland".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says it's his "highest ambition" to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of rebuilding the North-East club, which currently sits in third place in the Premier League, just three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B grade and that was it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland in the Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that's always something that draws me back.
But such an opportunity would only come if I was successful in running the club.
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio. He was also the manager of the club from 2007 to 2011.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he felt no anxiety about following such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down forwards from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the time would have been measured by the question of whether I could get this club back into the Premier League.
"The structure and equipment of this club makes it a Premier League club", he said.
It's not an easy task to get him back, but I think I'd feel successful if I could just get the club back.
Ross has only had a three-year managerial career, having previously served as an assistant manager at Dumarton and spent 15 months as a Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and transformed St Mirren from a starting relegation to championship winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels much better now than he has ever felt in his career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"They were probably real crossroads", he recalls, "when Alloa was taken".
I really believed that directing was the right thing for me, more than acting.
It sounds weird, because I was good, I made good money, and I enjoyed the heights.
But acting can be challenging.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through them in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good about being in charge.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm doing it, I feel like I'm in my own skin the most in my entire adult life.
The full interview can be heard on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 BST
Research has found that the best time to pee is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave boosted revenues for struggling British pubs, but added pressure on the restaurant chain.
Figures show that pub and bar groups recorded a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July  but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consultancy, who produced the final reports, said: Stable sunshine and England's longer-than-expected World Cup appearance meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, when pub attendance increased by 2.8 per cent, but restaurants were even more affected.
The decline in restaurant sales of 1.8% in June worsened in July.
Drinks and bars have fared the best, as have restaurants.
Restaurants, whose main revenue is from food, also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, of the leisure and hospitality analytics firm, said: "These results are a continuation of the trend that has been ongoing since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurant chains continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent annual decline in sales will be particularly painful in light of ongoing cost pressures.
A long hot summer can't be a bad time for food-hungry business owners, and time will tell whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring much-needed relief.
The overall growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK's pub, bar and restaurant industry sales monitor, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined turnover of over £9 billion, which is the industry standard for the sector.
One in five children has a secret social networking account that they keep from their parents
One in five children aged just 11 has a secret social media account that hides from parents and educators, research shows
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Instagram accounts
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty per cent of pupils said they had a "parent" account, which their parents knew about
One in five children  aged just 11  creates social networking accounts that they keep secret from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in "fake Instagram accounts" where they share photos.
Reports indicate concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a fancy "main" account, which their parents knew about, and they also had a private account.
One mother, who came across a secret website for her 13-year-old daughter, found that her teenager was encouraging others to rape her.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools has shown that 40 per cent of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, with half admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "Voice of Athletes" at the Scottish Athletic Committee.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Management Committee.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in the sport, and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those in the sport's leadership like yourself, who will benefit from her extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a wide respect in the Scottish, UK and global athletic community and we are confident that she will be of great benefit to athletics in Scotland as a member of the committee", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be truly beneficial and help lead the sport in Scotland".
An American who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, won a total of four gold medals, and is now a regular on the BBC, could not walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a seizure a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It's exhausting, but I've made a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing the exercise today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!
A milk-sucking machine that evokes comparisons of mothers to cows shares views online
A company that makes vacuum cleaners has spread an online opinion with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to lactating cows.
As part of the launch of the world's first silent wearable vacuum cleaner, consumer technology company Envi has released a music video with a caption showing the freedom the new vacuum cleaner gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a barn full of hay with cows to the lyrics: "Yes, I'm touching, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed I don't have any tails, here are my breasts".
The chorus goes on: "Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I water my sweet milk".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a controversial reaction online.
The video has had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and has received mixed reactions from those who have seen it, with many saying it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
A very poor decision to abuse cows for the advertising of this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after birth", says one commenter.
The Elvie suction cup is placed discreetly on the breast (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who keep their babies?
Someone else added: "This commercial is totally out of line".
Some even came forward to oppose the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "contagious".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd get the pump if I was still pissing.
I feel like a cow when I suck.
The commercial is a little crazy, but it's on point.
It's a genius product", one user wrote.
Another added: "It's a funny commercial aimed at mothers who suck their milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows".
It is not an advertisement to praise or curse the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women are shown dancing with discreet vacuum cleaners hidden under their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that many women who suck milk report feeling like cows.
But Elvie's vacuum cleaner is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and fits nicely into the breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold the baby, and even walking while vacuuming.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers, added: The Elvie suction cup is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a strong and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the sucking of milk and all the challenges that come with it, while also showing the fun and dependable incredible feeling of freedom that the new sucker provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's vacuum cleaner has been in the sun.
During London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski, who was using the product, appeared on the dock.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved into a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, mainly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with escorts.
Most of the escorts were traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants who were afraid of jeopardizing their ability to stay in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to provide fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement testified before Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who were seeking escort status for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Up to 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsors' households are in our country illegally, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we're going to continue to pursue them, Mr. Albence said.
According to asylum workers, in an effort to process cases involving children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some children to appear in court within a month of detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
Many appear via videoconference instead of in person to declare their case legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer a child is in foster care, the more likely he or she is to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape, asylum workers say, reporting from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers say that these concerns are heightened in larger facilities like Tornillo, where signs of a child's suffering are more likely to go unnoticed, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time for emotional preparation or for parting with friends could trigger the trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria has announced that the US, French and Turkish "occupation" forces are to withdraw immediately.
During a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also called for the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, even as the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the acting prime minister, said that foreign forces are in Syrian territory illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that they will be treated accordingly.
"He must surrender immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror in Syria is almost over, with more than 360,000 people killed and millions more displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus will continue to fight in this holy battle until we rid all Syrian territory of terrorist groups and any illegally present foreigners.
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in war-torn countries.
In handing over the refugees, Moualem said that conditions were good for them to return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that had made the refugees unwilling to return.
"We have contacted international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery aid will be available to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last haven of Idlib has created an opportunity to move further in the political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military intervention will target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who will be "exterminated".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition will soon take place to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "a review of the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 election again, unless, as many liberal observers hope, the impeachment and scandals prematurely end his presidency.
In that case, it would be undoubtedly the most dramatic presidential finale in history!
So far, there's no sign of any stalker fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has increased cable viewership to 3.5 million watching the nightly news headlines.
"It's a burning that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of "Designated Survivor", a drama on ABC about a cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, the veteran comedy writer and host of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
He remembers riding a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"Because he's funny", Mrs Scovell told me.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story taking place in Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and benefit the global economy.
Tune-in is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond whether you're an informed citizen to watch a panel of experts for six hours discuss how Bob Woodward uses deep backup resources for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich leather jacket, and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' disgusting depiction of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'm not gonna watch Super Maria the same way again, by the way.
"Part of what makes the reality show feel like it's feeding you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Pawn Stars documentary on Trump's rotating NFL show, which honors Kim Jong-un.

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny outside on the north shore of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he was trapped inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the line.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Money from outside flows into the tightest domestic races of the midterm election
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a financial surge after congressional redistricting generated two incumbents fighting for the same seat.
This recently led to the re-creation of the Pittsburgh suburban district by District Democratic Republican Conor Lamb who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is up against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, there was a redrawing of the map.
The race in the new 17th district started a fierce financial dispute between the main party's financial branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became well known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election to the 18th Congressional District.
This seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight lead.
America is considering fining El Salvador for supporting China, then backing down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under moderate pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until the partners court-martialed the Trump leadership's organizing team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the U.S. diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement released earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which would include cutbacks in financial aid and focus on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
With internal negotiations continuing, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity that followed similar negotiations the previous year, which were seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the US.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made clear they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively conclude any pending fines for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now tasked with handling the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of the administration's signal to negotiate, diplomats said.
And three American envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new, unassailable news from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr. Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal negotiations on the condition of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the government executive and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The history of the study
The final nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller's report from the Special Committee on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's right to exercise his office, which is now abundantly documented in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's investigation is also reportedly looking into whether Mr. Trump's campaign contained a secret deal with Russia to attack our elections.
If there were a change of party in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to answer to this body, just as he is preparing to re-appear before the voters, and eventually a jury of his peers would probably be waiting for him.
That's a whole series of ifs, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, as is the case with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long the suffering will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, all they had to do was get the Western powers to stand up and support him in Munich Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long, bloody years that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that speed up or slow down the relentless march of democracy.
Americans now face several similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who is in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on the case since the news broke last year that he had proposed secretly recording the president, speculating that he was not in the medical condition to hold the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' version is inaccurate.
What do we do if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or what if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite convincing sexual assault charges and false testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will face a long dark night.
But I believe we won't fail, thanks to a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles on the swastika table on the Sabbath.
With such a legacy, how could I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna match
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians would give them high hopes for promotion from Group G of the Europa League after an impressive draw in Spain at Villarreal earlier this month.
A knee injury prevented full-back Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal have a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could grab something, and we took the point.
Maybe we could have made it a lot more at the end, but overall, I think the draw was fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we got better and we were better again.
Thursday is another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be hard because they played well in the last game, but with the fans behind us, I'm sure we can push and it'll be good.
Last year was pretty tough, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but I feel really good about it now.
The team is strong and the boys are really enjoying it, and the training is great.
I hope we can build on this now, put the past behind us and be successful.
Women are worried about retirement savings
Although the survey respondents had a clear idea of how they would be cared for, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people in the national study said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't choose to discuss it with them", explains Holly Snyder, vice president of a national life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caregiving if you do not make your wishes known.
Discuss with your counselor and your family where and how to receive care, as these factors can play a big role in determining the cost.
Consult your financial adviser: A financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, for example, by traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance, which helps you pay for these expenses, or by self-insurance using your own resources  as long as you have money.
Create your own legal documents: Avoid legal battles while you can.
Appoint a health care representative, who will be a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that doctors follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate yourself.
Also consider writing a full power for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your accounts are paid in case you are not able to do so yourself.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your aged parent is in urgent need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write these details down in a written plan to be ready.
"It's not just about finances, but what are the names of the doctors who treat you?" asks Martin.
Where are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the above plan ready.
A man in Ilfracombe was shot multiple times from a jet
As a man was walking home after a night's retreat, he was hit by several bullets from a jet plane.
The victim, aged about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and officials say the death toll is expected to rise.
As communications are down, auxiliary units could not get any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the Donggala Regency, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 kilometres (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
Regency, an administrative region under a province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the Donggala tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami also hit the western Donggala in 1996, claiming nine lives.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A minor earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastating effects of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami formed, but more than 100 died as a result of the collapsing buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin, a resident of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating the domestic violence reporting and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin has been sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU reports.
According to the network, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he stated that he felt "definitely innocent" when questioned for comment.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's had to face a criminal complaint.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack was reported to the police by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently before the Alaska Court of Veterans' Affairs.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, breaching a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while under the influence of intoxicating substances in connection with the incident.
He allegedly punched his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by war veterans groups in 2016 for associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his son's service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks are down and casualty numbers are expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck a part of the island of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos of the moment of disaster have surfaced on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu City when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking an extraordinary death sentence for a suspect in the NYC terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, suspected of carrying out the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional sentence not imposed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly carried out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October using a rented Home Depot truck, which he used to sweep pedestrians and cyclists.
To defend the death penalty, the plaintiffs will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused a series of injuries. This is how the terms of the intent to impose the death penalty are defined in a document approved by the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both of those numbers would mean the possibility of a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 felony counts, including murder for extortion, a charge commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and preparation", prosecutors claim, describing the way Saipov carried out the act as "disgusting, cruel and perverse".
'Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevese, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Pagnucci', is named in the resolution.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District Court of New York last handed down the death penalty.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out was in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were sent to the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching Islamic State videos on his phone.
Police also revealed that he also demanded that an Islamic State flag be flown in the hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were obviously disappointed with the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say he should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has pledged to mobilize the people's army during a protest at the Conservative Party conference today.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party has said that politicians must "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics  as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested, he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would be out by now if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the problem Mrs May faces in reconciling her ranks, where deep divisions are rife, has been highlighted by the EU's remaining conservatives, who have joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amidst attacks from Brexiters, Remainers and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels regardless of the consequences  and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said that the Leave Means Leave group is meeting in Solihull where he wants to "snap out of Chequers".
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he declared.
Wellingborough added: 'I'm in favour of Brexit, but we have to drop Chequers.
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We didn't fight the world wars to be compelled to obey.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.'
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns, who was also at the march, told reporters: 'I'm simply saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and he is not liked by members of our party or our activists who are currently filling the streets to get us elected at all.
Forget the Chequers and start listening.
In a sharp message to Mrs May, he says: 'Chairmen of Cabinet will keep their posts if they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage said that conservative politicians must 'get themselves into an awkward situation' if they want to betray their decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us people and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let you.
In a message to the excited crowd, he added: 'I want our political class, which is on the verge of breaking Brexit, to feel the pressure.
'We are now mobilizing the army of the people of this country, who secured us a victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud Great Britain, ruling itself.
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists held up banners for the Conservatives against Brexit after the party's launch weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues with the party's app after the conference began.
'These are the people who, in their own words, can deliver IT systems and technology for Canada plus plus, for border-free, for border-free free trade in Ireland,' he added.
"It's all a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is planning to give a hard think about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "consider carefully" running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday at the Western Massachusetts City Hall.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She found herself at the center of speculation that she might stand up to Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means women at the top.
He was arrested on suspicion of shooting Sims from LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the Friday shooting of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytone Simpson, at the 11:00 ET news conference.
A video of Friday's shooting has been released with a request to identify the man captured on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot in the early hours of Friday near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a non-life-threatening gunshot wound to the head", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to moving around the scene, carrying a gun, and admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was apprehended without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-6 Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, 10 of them last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title when the team's management hand him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas finished Saturday's qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' team management would play a big role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two corners and challenged Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the depot first and let Hamilton catch up with the cars circling the tail of the group, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes driver crashed into the garage a lap later and after the start, he lined up behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead and in a close fight the Ferrari reluctantly had to leave the inside track free to defend in the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and at the end of the first lap, on his 21st birthday, he was in the lead.
He then led for much of the race, keeping the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and to secure fourth place for Kimi Raikkonen.
He eventually crashed on lap 44, but he could no longer pick up pace on the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri's been doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he was a perfect gentleman.
"The team has done a fantastic job and the prize is the first two places", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech to a rally in West Virginia, he did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead stating that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are evil and disgusting and lying.
"One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that's happening in the last few days in Sennaar, when you see the anger, when you see these people, how angry and evil and disgusting and lying", he said.
"When you look at the release and the release and they say to you, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you responsible for the leak?
Remember her answer... you published the documentary?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
She didn't publish it.
Well, wait a minute.
We published... no, that's not it, he added, and he imitated the senator.
The Feinstein family sent a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the information leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that any leak had occurred from her office.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's accusations, nor did I release information about the case", Ms. Feinstein told The Hill.
She asked me to keep everything a secret, and I did exactly what she asked.
But her words were apparently not believed by the president, who said at a rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, that's really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continues to defend a Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual harassment, and has suggested that Democrats are using the accusations to their own ends.
They are determined to take back power by any means available.
You see the meanness, the abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to kick into the ground to get back to power and to the helm", Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
The elite league, the Dundee Stars 5-3 the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants with a win in Saturday's penalty shoot-out at Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The Giants soon took a two-point lead with the interceptions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to tie the game at home before Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard then tied for Dundee again, and then two goals from Lucas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Premier League this season for Adam Keefe's side, who managed to beat Belfast Dundee 2-1 on Friday.
The two teams met for the fourth time this season, with the Giants dominating all three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with Kendall McFaul's assist, while David Rutherford credited the assist to Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first half was wild as Sullivan got the home run back in the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt set up a goal for Cownie that tied it at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went into the first half with only a lead, when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first quarter.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard managed to equalise again with a goal from a long-range play in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran's joint work later in the second-third helped Nielsen swing the lead to Dundee for the first time in the match, and the same player secured his team's lead in the middle of the final third.
The Giants, who have now lost their fourth of five games, will play their next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
The air traffic controller died to allow the hundreds of people on board the plane to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died while overseeing the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The strong aftershocks flooded the area, leaving many people trapped in the ruins of Palu.
But even as his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild as the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palou shook.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was shaking.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We arranged for a helicopter transport from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was used to transport him to a hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"Our hearts are broken by this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities have expressed concern that the death toll could reach thousands, and the disaster response agency said access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is still rising as many bodies remain unresolved under the wreckage and many are still not reached by rescuers", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves in the devastated city of Palo have reached a height of 20 feet, and a mass funeral will be held in the city on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft are bringing aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, more bodies are being brought in by ambulances.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Small businesses are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find on the ground.
It's a tragedy, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night and complete all tasks that are necessary for evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by the Lombok earthquakes that year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now claims one person missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in a lagoon on one of the Micronesian islands in the Pacific has now reported one person missing, initially stating that all passengers and crew, totaling 47, had safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that it was unable to locate one male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details about this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane went down in the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that a total of seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in treatment on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane landed from a very low altitude.
"That was really good", Jaynes said.
Jaynes went on to say that he and others managed to get through the water down the belt to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He further stated that the flight crew panicked and screamed and that he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby on repairs to the pier helped rescue passengers by using a inflatable boat to carry them ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet [30 m].
The Aviation Safety Network reports that a total of 111 persons have died in accidents involving PNG-designated aircraft over the last two decades, but no accidents have occurred with Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday concluded its speech in this case, in which a man is repeatedly tried for burning a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett, has been testifying for several hours and providing expert opinions in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analyst for the jury drafted a scenario using cell phone records of the 29th defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers' company the night of her death, which contradicted his previous testimony, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the cell phone records proved that he had spent the evening with Chambers, he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, who was then visited by the police.
Sanford stood before the court in the council chamber and testified that he was not in town on the day in question.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth about being in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was lying because my car was in Nashville that night.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis stated that he knew Chambers for about two weeks before the day she died.
However, cell phone records indicate that the two had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing remarks on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be brought before the jury later that day.
What is conscious hip hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to address the negative perceptions of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based band High Breed claim hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political messages and solutions to social problems.
So they want to go back to their roots and re-populate conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have already met with a revival in the recent past thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?!
A NY nursing school teacher is suing a couple for firing her after a racist text message.
A New York City nanny is suing a couple for their discriminatory eviction after she received a mistaken text message from her mother calling her "another black girl" in the text message.
The couple denied being racist and likened the lawsuit to blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her horror when she found out on her first day at work in 2016 that her children's new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NEW, NEXT BLACK", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Fr Maurice.
When she realized her faux pas, the worried Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had been doing really badly and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for unemployment compensation and is seeking $350 per day for the six-month assignment she was originally hired to do, even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them that this is not done", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple, however, countered by saying that they were not racist, but that terminating Mrs. Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure, as they feared that after the insult, they would no longer trust her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
"We're not racists", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you trust your child to someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on, now.
Plasco likened the lawsuit to "extortion" and said his wife was caring for a two-month-old baby and was in a "very difficult situation".
Would you ride someone like that?
That's not a nice thing at all, said the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, the jury on social media was quick to condemn the pair for their behavior and logic.
Publishers of Paddington stories feared readers would not identify with the talking bear, recent reports show
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, told the reporter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes when you read it for the first time, before it's published.
It's very amusing to know that now that we know the Paddington bear's tremendous success.
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about the little teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, adding on the 60th anniversary of the book's publication that became a "sweet bitterness" point after his death last year.
To Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of her family", she added that her father was very proud of his final achievement.
"He was a quiet man, never a braggart", she said.
But because Paddington was such a real figure to him, it was like having a child who had accomplished something you could be really proud of.
I believe he saw Paddington's success in that light.
Though it was his own creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all success to Paddington alone.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louise Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"He called me regularly to tell me it was really bad and that he didn't expect to get over it", Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then I got a call from Nada telling me she was gonna die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
So I did it.
I said, Tash, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medications that doctors had given her to keep her heart running were slowly losing their effectiveness and leaving her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything was closed.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I just had to keep it together.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without revealing the ordeal she was undergoing.
"No one knew about it", she said.
I kept my head down, tears running down my face.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a tremendous understanding of Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending out postcards to Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers where people can seek support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and as a result took his own life at 18.
"I wouldn't want any other parent to feel what I felt every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a gifted young chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile could light up any room.
However, he quit his job before he died because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his sibling's body after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis says: "I am constantly worried about how this will affect his life".
Mrs. Davis designed the postcards to let people know that there are people available who are willing to help them and can talk to them, even if they are their friends.
Don't sit silent You must speak
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a lifelong friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"Nothing told me he was feeling down or depressed, nothing at all", she explains.
Then, a few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
The worst part was on Christmas Day when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them, nothing.
She said that the death of her partner was a huge trauma for them, but that they had to get over it gradually: This can make a hole in the family.
It tore us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the balance of how the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought we could get something that he actually asked for", "an investigation in a time limit, with a limited scope", "we could bring a little unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would fall apart" because both sides would be buried in the positions they had taken after the partisanship.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6, and if the Republicans do badly as expected, it will lead to their fundamental weakening in their attempts to promote the man they want to the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators, lobbied them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush, and through him he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens if the FBI compiles their report?
The Senate is going to vote on it, and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Still, it's unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees under Kim has dropped
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un's rule began seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers say.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said that there were 1,127 escapees in the past year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that this is due to tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates demanded by smugglers at the borders.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of refugees from the North are now being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them are fleeing through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This came at the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms of cooperation on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the United States of making no progress on sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament makes him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remark in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if any woman ever performed such a play, they would call her a hysterical woman", Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both in their teens.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying their accusations against him were a "grotesque and coordinated attack" by organized liberals who couldn't get over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he showed prejudice against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by these statements and the way he leaned on the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi has said no when asked if she would seek Kavanaugh's impeachment if he were confirmed, even if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll tell you this, if he's not telling the truth to Congress, then he's not only eligible to serve on the Supreme Court, but he's not eligible to serve on the court he's serving on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals .
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential courtroom performance in the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he's considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings before his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would reverse any Supreme Court decisions.
"There's no time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to stand in a courtroom and expect us to just say, 'Oh, that's beautiful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to rule it.
After months and years of verbal abuse, she couldn't get it out of her head without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, is it?
She goes on to say, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a director somewhere, and she told me that she also cries when she's angry, but she developed a technique, which is when she's angry and she starts to cry, she would say to the person she's talking to, "You might think I'm crying because I'm sad.
But I'm mad.
And so she kept doing it.
And I think that's great.
Tears are acceptable as a means of responding to anger, in part because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in a male-dominated office, and one day I was there, expressing my inexpressible anger in tears, but the older, always cold manager, who I was always a little afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and forced to retire from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found there was no reason why she couldn't explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a laugh after 30 years.
There were already seven other candidates running, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
But because the campaign was running at that time, she couldn't keep up with the crowdfunding, so she vowed not to run unless she got $2 million in crowdfunding.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Does he think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally campaign, she was completely overwhelmed by her emotions - in gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise money, and focusing on voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - that she was completely choking on anger.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder said of the press reaction.
And you might think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they might write on my headstone.
Did you cry?
Why a Sino-American trade war may be good for Beijing
The initial wave of the U.S.-China trade war has been deafening, and while the battle is far from won, experts say a rift between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
But most of the most significant escalations saw the light of day this week, with the announcement of new tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, which means virtually taxing half of China's trade exports to the US.
Beijing has responded each time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to 10 percent of the $60 billion in U.S. imports.
China has tried to repay the US with the same coin, and it's unlikely that the world's second largest economy will be brought to its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington back on track, it would mean giving in to its demands, but publicly submitting to American demands would be utterly humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts think that if Beijing plays its cards right, a U.S. trade war could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The reality is that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that trigger an economic upheaval in both countries, which is far more dangerous than observers have previously admitted", said Abigail Grace, an Asia research fellow at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to take back refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to accept the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are now met, as are unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million people have fled Syria since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime welcomes any assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that have sponsored the rebels.
Europe responded strongly to victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Euria won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the brink of trouble in France.
The U.S. now lost for the sixth straight time on European soil, not winning the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team scored 14.5 points, which was needed to beat the USA.
USA star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for most of the tour, then kicked a ball into the water at 3 pairs on the 16th hole and handed the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari then shone through all his laps, becoming one of four players to achieve the best 5-0-0 record since the current tournament format was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5 and 4 by the lowest rated European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
World's highest rated player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who was probably in his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain became the top European player overall with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself tonight.
It's been a rough year.
So thank you to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy, that I got the cup back.
"It's all about the team, I'm happy I could help", Garcia said after winning Europe.
He handed the trophy to his countryman John Ramp, who on Sunday beat American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles.
"I feel incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I've grown up watching this guy", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, a feat only Jack Nicklaus can match.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the USA, after the disappointing results of his team, said, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
We really warmed Europe up this morning.
We really didn't make it.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We're reorganizing and working with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could be their captain.
I really need to suck.
You've outplayed us.
Red tide update: Concentration is declining in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties.
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission indicates an overall decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC release, flowering water spots are now being reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties  indicating a decreasing concentration.
The flowering waters of the red tide stretch for about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The spots were spotted about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but last week, it was in relatively fewer places.
Red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
In the past week, moderate concentrations have been reported in coastal or open sea areas in Pinellas County, low to high concentrations in the Hillsborough area, low to high concentrations in the Manatee area, low to high concentrations in coastal or open sea areas in Sarasota County, low to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, low to high concentrations in coastal or open sea areas in Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory distress continues to occur in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation was reported in northwest Florida last week.
