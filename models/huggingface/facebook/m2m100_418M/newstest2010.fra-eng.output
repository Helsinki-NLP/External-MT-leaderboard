Barack Obama is the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, the medal and the cheque of $1.4 million will be awarded to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a charged program.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple planned an interview with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet its summit in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious prize.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third who will be awarded the prize in the committee’s office itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan when the award was awarded.
The president does not want to avoid this subject because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a president who leads a war in two countries at the moment.
He strengthened war efforts a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which no of his critics will forget to emphasize.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 1.1 million euros).
He intends to donate to charity works, but he has not yet made a concrete decision which.
His commissioned program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather rejective at this price at the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he does not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that this is not a prize for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as he.
From the announcement, he said that it would be a "invitation to act" for him.
Nature defenders accused of chantage
The police of Litoměřice accused the chairman of the association Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice of chantage.
Several times last year he appealed for several construction workshops and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokeswoman for the police of Litoměřice.
The President of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in prison and risks up to three years in prison.
The waste sorting benens are not in the perfume in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their packaging of drinks, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sort bands at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take a few minutes before you find the right goods.
I don’t want to say that we won’t sort any waste in Brno at all.
But I have the impression that the municipal councils of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of waste sorting not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of goods dedicated to these waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city centre?
It is a whole science, which requires mostly time and steel nerves.
The only place I have found for now is the Moravia Square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don’t want me, but it seems to me very little.
Not to mention the fact that in other neighborhoods of the city it is not a sinecure either.
So, in the end, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
by lazy.
It makes them a trick to get to the Bennes.
I am not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, I proposed to go to throw a few glass and PVC bottles.
Except that I have not noticed any shade of color street Kounicova.
Fortunately I found the right place by taking the tram.
But the waste was overflowing.
It’s after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?
It is probably that ecology and a alleged aesthetism are not too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first league of hockey that shame the city throughout the country, instead of buying a few extra goods and offering the sort of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am pleased to have been able to strengthen my impression with official statistics after taking a moment on the internet.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst of the entire South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget removed from the Argentine retirement and disease holidays
After the left has increased, despite the opinion of the government, farmers or even officials it may be that there is a lack of money for retirement, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interests on state debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive spending, retirement or illness holidays. "It's just putting the problems back to later, mining the ground," said Janota.
It must be known that on the money borrowed the interests to be paid are increasingly high and that it will need to be returned sooner or later.
The state really has no choice to know where to get the money.
If he does not lower social aid or expenditure, he will have to increase taxes.
To all those that the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and should not be afraid for their retirement or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater state debt - the next year there will not be a lack of 163 billion in the cash, but more.
Despite Minister Janota’s efforts, the debt will thus grow more and more rapidly and with it, interest-related spending.
The state will need money to repaid it and it will no longer be enough to slightly raise VAT or decrease maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
It will also be missing five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few voter groups.
These are mainly already decided and started pieces of which it is not possible to modify the projects to eventually reduce the costs.
To keep them, which is not free either.
This means to delay or stop thirty major workshops, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to warning by Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD proposed to resolve the financial deficit very carefully - it will draw in the dividends of the ČEZ (electric power supplier and distributor), which the state possesses mostly and will feed the transport funds.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no case a foundation-free sum.
Last year, it was 18 billion that was navigated from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends serve to pay for the removal of environmental damage, to complete the pension accounts or even serve as a reserve for the preparing pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of the GDP according to EU rules.
It is far from the end of the carnival.
The budget for various compensation to the victims of communism and crimes, and even housing savings, decreased by three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without that money.
It is a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save from the department side or, in the worst case, touch the government’s budget reserve.
There is also a shortage of a hundred million to the two-billion-value state-of-the-country project, which must allow to track online what the expenditure of each administration is.
The first stage will begin in January.
If the finance minister did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just a button and you’ll move from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely the possibility that is the goal of the U.S. company VMware, which is mainly concerned with the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can change them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional.
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and it was made a first demonstration a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, which run the Windows Mobile and Android systems mentioned simultaneously.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is growing.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains disrupts hotels
Desert pistes do not pose a problem only to the river-pent operators.
Lack of snow disturbs people from booking their ski stay in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to discount free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits on our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for the prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mole at Christmas,” said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it is better not to hesitate to book too much.
If you give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation comes only afterwards, then you can try to wait a few more days.
Spindler’s hosts currently offer only one week stay for the New Year.
I think they’ll try another moment to put them, but they’ll give up and accept shorter periods as well.
And then the number of free rooms will rapidly decrease,” Jandura estimated.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter seasons.
The Christmas Week is the most interesting for us for the moment, it’s not completely sold.
There is still free, let’s say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheap last minute Christmas stays,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The tourist agency of Vrchlabí can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February go equally well, the remaining winter holidays are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks are covered over the week, Christmas will also be complete,” Schiefert thinks.
On the contrary, the occupation of Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
There is an improvement of about 5 percent.
We have a few last places for the New Year and for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the January holidays of the Poles and February sells well as well,” says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near Jánské Lázně central parking is also full at eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty on Christmas in the latest hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have seventy percent of occupation at the moment.
February is slightly weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow will fall, the interest in the stay in the Krkonoše will still grow, said Omnia hotel manager Erik Sporysch.
However, the hostels of Krkonoše should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cold and if there are rainfall, they should be snowful in the mountains.
But later, the weather is expected to warm, Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institut reports.
United States: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
He becomes even comic, the asside effort with which Barack Obama, a wise president, reproduces his predecessor’s strategy on the Afghan issue, which he himself considered very simple.
When he ended up leaving his doctrine so ardently expected to be swallowed, it turned out that he had copied it to carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not pleased to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is more, to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A new way forward."
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements into an Iraq consumed by the civil war as being “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, which issued recommendations from campaign commanders, was the only possible and susceptible to be so successful that the newspapers currently don’t talk about Iraq at all.
This has not improved Bush's reputation, it says, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favorable final situation than we could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again in Afghanistan
It was again the campaign commander who asked him to increase the military contingent, including the Afghan operation commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House’s rejections despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 people to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he scammed the general of at least 10,000 soldiers.
It managed to remove the promise of 5,000 extra from Europe, even though it originally counted on 10,000.
What brings the most problems throughout Obama’s strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to finish all this process within three years.
Many doubt that a half increase will bring the same fruits as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fraternal wars in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan stands out by the exact opposite – no one can rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, used to changing leaders day by day according to what arranges them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only the powder in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity regarding the reports, which are still complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "fast state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy makes it confused by his volunteering.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the edge of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out of reality heart can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the tumult of the war in order to their “right return home” will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible as the Taliban will see it as the indirect confession of the U.S. defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans’ willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is oriented towards the negative.
European politicians don’t know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically changing the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions do not have any effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult question of a solution to the problem by using military force.
This should be answered, for example, when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will lead to a dramatic reversal of the situation in Afghanistan.
The only rustine for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time for him to plan on a new strategy, in the event that it would prove to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses
Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash rewards this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticisms regarding its salary practices.
The group of 30 main leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to sell until five years.
The actions may be withdrawn to the leaders in case they would take too much risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link remunerations with long-term performance in Wall Street.
I suppose that Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The concern is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after leaving almost $17 billion for premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of the prizes will likely exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the strong prizes in the banking sector have become a sensitive political subject in many countries.
The UK announced on Wednesday that it intends to impose a single tax of fifty percent the bonuses of bankers exceeding £25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all fields except in physics.
There are five women, a record number, who today in Stockholm received the Nobel Prize in technical disciplines and literature from the hands of King Charles XVI Gustave.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, and their fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellows.
The chemistry award was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for having clarified the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom and his fellow Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn’t win this year was physics.
This award was awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fiber and George Smith with William Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, fax or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the Diploma, the Nobel Medal and the Certificate of Acquisition of the Money Award.
This reaches 10 million Swedish crowns in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the prize with each other.
The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to U.S. President Barack Obama in Oslo.
He, in his speech, recognized the controversial nature of his reward as he is only at the beginning of his journey and he is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To the discharge of his policy he added that in some situations war is indispensable to peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign.Klaus invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who puts his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for the next year as it was voted by the House of Deputies.
It is estimated that the budget and also the position of Janota in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
He also criticized the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further burns the public financial crisis.
The President’s spokesman, Radim Ochvat, was informed of the meeting.
Janota will then discuss his position with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus’s signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic is expected to manage.
However, the House of Representatives validated on Wednesday the left’s proposals on money transfers and increased the payments of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a disagreement that questioned the future of the Fischer cabinet that had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the CSSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was voted by the MPs, removes the package of savings passed by Fischer’s government and which he says has to end the state’s debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget but that nothing obliges it, said today during a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irrefrenable deficit" of public finances.
He said there is no favorable solution.
Only a strong government could bring improvement if it could rely on a broader political party consensus, he said.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is scary and the government should question its subsequent existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
ČSSD leader Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is scary and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSSD declared the ratification of the state budget for the next year successful.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invincu will show the world a lot of things about the country, its battles and its victories.
The story talks about sports, relations between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor awarded for the Oscars, carries the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, unbeatable fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was a nineteenth-year-old Mandela who asked him to make him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, "If I have to incarn you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby drama located in the middle of the box has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery becoming himself a slave, a fictional US president, or even God in the film Evan All-Powerful but never someone still alive and so important for so many people as Mandela.
The former South African state man has been jailed for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of the apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became the president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invincible and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team, François, to unite the country. The newly elected president, Mandela, knows that his country remains and remains racally and economically divided after the apartheid.
He is convinced to be able to unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world rank.
The South African team will eventually advance in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked for a few years to bring Mandela’s story to the big screen.
I had no other goal than to play this role in such a way as to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dinner with him, to be in the background before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to stretch his hand.
I realized that when I stretched your hand, I recovered from your energy, it was transmitted and I felt as if you were feeling, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard middle of the rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I ringed at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the houlette of the director Eastwood received positive reviews and even talks about ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy from Daily Variety summarized his appreciation in these words: "This is a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com site, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: Russians tested a missile
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
The Russian Defence Ministry has only acknowledged that it has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the "Bulava" type missile that was originally the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the missile tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn’t fly, or it was damaged in full flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "the missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn’t fly but bright
The 13th trial took place normally at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there were again damages to the aircraft.
It was obviously the engine of the third floor of the missile that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the Dmitry Donsky nuclear submarine that was navigating under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be just launched from a moving and immersed ship.
That's why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably a defective "Bulava".
Norwegians have no doubt for a moment that it is a Russian missile.
Generals argue that this time, we can’t talk about absolute failure.
The first two floors of the missile resisted and the disaster only touched the third.
In previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first floor.
Even though none of the test launches did not take place without attachments, the defense ministry’s leadership considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of fifty percent so fills the generals of optimism and they therefore still claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defendant Viatcheslav Fetissov will reappear in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend strength to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his entry already during the Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at forty years in 1998, is currently the CSKA president.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defense.
Fetissov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We still have to fix some details about the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, cited by the agency AP.
It has not been specified whether the legendary hockey player's comeback will involve only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return on the ice, Fetissov becomes thus the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and won 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most successful.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won twice the gold at the Olympic Games, seven world championship titles, he won the Canada Cup as well as the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also earned tribute in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Temple since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to trade unions and cancelled all additional hours
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice agreed with the trade unions to cancel all additional hours.
It is precisely due to the frequent additional hours that trade unions declared an emergency strike on Monday.
Petr Vaněk, a spokesman for the Hyundai factory, confirmed this.
The management, however, wants to reach an agreement with the trade unions on a Saturday working again this year.
We can’t give up our production plan, it’s essential, that’s why additional volunteer hours were offered on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The site Sedmička.cz said that the company offered a 400 Czech crown bonus to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the working day on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for additional hours.
They either receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can put a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their end-year holidays said Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive a compensation for transportation costs and for their lunch.
Given the fact that the extra hours were the most urgent and hot point in the comments and claims of trade unions and employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, the management made the immediate decision to cancel all the extra hours for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the automotive factory employees were forced to work almost daily two additional hours in addition to their eight hours.
The trade unions are hoping to cancel the state of strike after the agreement is signed.
The next negotiation between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions will take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the state of strike if they agreed on their claims and signed a common document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when 400 employees spontaneously started strike due to the uninterrupted additional hours.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and alleged bizutages.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the requirements in the field of automotive production.
At the announcement of the strike on Monday, trade unions also demanded that workers who stopped production be subjected to any sanctions.
The trade unions call on the company to reduce the time spent in extra hours to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (about €209) for these.
The Hyundai Car Factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
The series began production in November last year.
It has produced about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "resistant" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists test new combinations that can slow the proliferation of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed a drug immunity.
This reality takes, in some cases, the top on the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some medications already available.
There is no way to cure AIDS at this time.
However, the life of patients can be radically extended through a mixture of medications that prevent the multiplication of HIV in the body.
Their consumption, however, leads to a number of side effects.
Furthermore, the repression of this multiplication has the effect on the development of what is called resistant viruses on which the drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are an assembly of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used so far and that’s why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of the researchers leads them to discover new “upgrade” substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their connections to the viral proteins.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages are formed by the bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a HIV virus protein that is essential for the virus’s life cycle.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease there would not be the birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If the HIV protease is stopped, the virus’s spread in the patient’s body will also be stopped, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in tests as well as on its resistant variants, obtained in HIV-infected patients.
On the usual version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however, it does not weaken on resistant versions against which the usual drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are therefore interesting combinations to be further examined toward the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS takes it to Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS (Civil Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek, called the budget ratified for the next year as “destroying” and, according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the statements of the ODS a drastic verdict.
It takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Nečas said the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was obviously no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of the government should decide whether the House of Deputies supports the minority that is concerned about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about remaining in his functions with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrally opposite.
The House of Representatives on Wednesday ratified the budget for 2010, with the proposals for amendments of 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House has increased the money paid to the salaries of officials, to the functioning of social services and to direct payments to farmers.
The government’s complaint over the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, thus obeying the government's desire as a modified budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and Inutility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of inutility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to resign if the amendments were ratified, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota took a meeting with the Prime Minister on Monday after passing to the government:
He also said he was wondering if he would remain in his office.
His disappointment about the negotiations around the budget is the reason for this.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit such as those that affect health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: the ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and of the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing harmful, Topolánek said in a text statement from the United States.
He reminded that the vice-ministers of some ministries demand TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give his resignation in the face of conducting a struggle against the amount of public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that he is based on the left majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I haven’t thought about it and once it’s on the agenda then I’ll devote myself to it,” Defense Minister Martin Barták, elected to the government just by the Democrats, told reporters from the House.
Prime Minister Fischer fled in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS went back on the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas also stressed that the ODS would probably have voted on Wednesday against the amended budget if it had not expressly asked the Democrats to allow the vote on the budget.
We don’t feel like we’re orphans, we’re not little children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered complaints from the party’s chairman at the House or in the country during the budget negotiation.
I didn’t notice that my vote would be missing.
I already knew at the time I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the next months would be a bolchevization of the House and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek personally reacted.
According to the new schedules of the ČD there will be fewer trains for the same rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from December 13 some less charged express or regional trains and will, on the contrary, strengthen some others.
The total transport coverage will decrease on the day of the new schedules coming into force by two percent compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
It is for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostrava who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino branch.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
On the regional level, the largest decline in transportation concerns the region of Hradec Králové of eight percent in total, on the contrary Prague and its surroundings can enjoy an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also canceled and the traffic of a few express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to just a few days a week.
Among the biggest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburb system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main station of Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart by two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
This year’s invoice for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year in a total of four billion crowns to fix the visible losses, which is the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate in a total of three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not recour to a price rise of the vast majority of transport duties.
The changes will only affect the one-day tickets of ČD Net and the internet tickets at reduced prices eLiška.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will now depend on the journey travelled, while so far it was valid among cities of a region to choose and was at a single price of 160 crowns.
Philippine rebels arrest more than 50 people, children are released
The rebels have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
The news agency AFP it, but the source only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Around 19 rebels were to use the hostages as human shields during a flight to the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers as a result of violence caused during a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines due to a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the Governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippines province was arrested as a result of suspicion of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan line.
The island of Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
The parties, however, renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood film arrives in the US halls in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and tells a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-known anti-apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, the feedback of the critics and the audience is heard.
by Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he was then awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when, on the one hand, South Africa is in full preparations for the World Cup, and on the other hand because the media are agitated by worrying news about the increased racial conflicts and discrimination among the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the agency, the reactions to the new film are for the moment quite positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reserves issued to the main roles where Hollywood stars "pavaned".
Morgan Freeman is proud of the film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I got well prepared.
I’ve also met Nelson Mandela personally several times to be able – as they say – to recover from his energy, he said during the first film official in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember through the film the personality and the message of Mandela.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual he added.
Wear the national rugby team's t-shirt
The film is based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin the title is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave its creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his presidency.
Morgan Freeman thus tries during the film to collect two racial groups of a long-divided population and just like Nelson Mandela in 1995 he enters dressed in the South African team's national shirt on the grass of the World Cup, which South Africa had won then.
To be shown on the T-shirt grass, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been long ovationized fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
We hope that the football championship will succeed in uniting people again in a single nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to see if the South African situation will improve.
But South African white people are skeptical as he recently told in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to the UK.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
A transformator worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire burned in the morning a transformator of the company Čeps from the distribution center near the town of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for the Ustí firefighters, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the processor be consumed, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, mushroom and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short-circuit of the transformator.
No one was injured and according to the company spokesman Pavla Mandátova the incident does not put the safe operation of the transmission set in danger.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformator will need to be replaced by a new.
She adds that in ten years of activity, the company Čeps has not known anything similar and that the incidents of this type are isolated.
Electricity supply has not been interrupted, said the spokeswoman of the company ČEZ for North Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of households, administrations and industries has not been affected by the fire of the processing station.
A.S. Čeps is the exclusive operator on the territory of the Czech Republic of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
Itins, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from transport sets to distribution sets and line tracks of a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three Prefects of the CSSD
Radim Jančura, the owner of the Student Agency, will today file a complaint for defamation against three social-democratic prefects.
And concrete against Michal Hašek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura said it in Twenty Minutes of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is related to the company’s attempt to exploit regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions have finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three have attacked us and claim that we do the fine mouths, while we have only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
We only have to defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for the calomnies on the company Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
He also said he has evidence that no region has acted in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura’s complaint is the continuation of his media show that serves him as free advertising for his company and for his person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to clearly show that it is Mr. Jančura who manipulates the public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek.
Jančura has already last week that he will invest a few million crowns in a advertisement that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to take it back after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in a broad sense.
Jančura started its campaign after the regions agreed to assign the Czech Railways the operation of railways for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a tender.
According to Jančura, such a way of action is illegal and contrary to the European Court of Justice’s position.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even brought to Jančura threats by a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn’t stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who it is but I won't say his name, Jančura said today to Radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcus is free and optional.
Vaccination against pneumococcus will break down the old habits in January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are voices that say that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcus vaccination culminate.
The pharmaceutical institution has already set for vaccines the maximum prices that will be paid for the health insurance.
Experts also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccines.
The first dose of the vaccine should be given between the third and fifth months of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
However, the parents paid 1,600 crowns or even more for a dose.
The vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 crowns in vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
So far, the state spent about 500,000 crowns per year for all children’s vaccination.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the “Janota package”.
Pneumococcus is the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of severe infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age caused by pneumococcus infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Is vaccination mandatory?
There are opinions about a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the chairman of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsky said that a mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
The association has long been promoting pneumococcus vaccination.
At an international conference at which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have been able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that now needs to be followed, Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumococcus.
We are absolutely not considering it for the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, chairman of the Specialized Society of Pediatrists, acknowledges that volunteer-based vaccination has its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a decrease in the renewal of vaccines "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a amount I understand the decision making the vaccine facultative," however, Cabrnochová says.
Experts predict that from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their babies.
The pneumococcus vaccination also marks a breakdown because it is the first child vaccination that is funded by the insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance companies should release funds for prevention, thereby saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will need to buy their own products.
This, however, is related to the concerns of practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to make the vaccines buy by the insurance, the doctors receiving them in the same way as the other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some members, however, feared that this would allow the insurance companies to “deduce the amounts of health insurance.”
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait until the insurance returns them.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while he charged 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trail.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical peel to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81 years old, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbar and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the news agency Associated Press (AP).
AP said a police officer said the young Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr., 52, claims to have been allowed by his father to "in the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings into a storage facility," the agency.
Mr. Frazetta Senior refuses to give such permission, the agency said.
The Labour advocates an increase in the budgetary tax.
The ministers defended the increase in taxes and expenditure reductions announced in the Pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "was missing" an opportunity to show that he was serious about the reduction of the deficit by delaying his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted the lightning by fighting low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see an increase of 0.5% in Social Insurance and a threshold rate of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The syndicates protested that low wages are punished by a recession for which they are not responsible and warned that “problems” were announced.
The decrease in Social Insurance – which will allow to get about 3 billion GBP a year – has made the world of angry because, according to him, it is a job tax while the goal should be a recovery of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than 20,000 GBP per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
Principles of Pre-Budget Report
Social Insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
Economy will decline more than 4.75% expected this year
50% tax on bankers’ bonuses
Increased Corporate Profit Tax for Small Companies
Reduction of tax on electric cars and winds
An increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to the Treasury estimates, a person winning 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person winning 40,000 GBP will lose 190 GBP, while a person winning 10,000 GBP per year will earn 110 GBP more.
The ministers said their goal of reducing the deficit by half before 2013 resulted in "hard decisions" but insisted that 60% of the charge of additional taxes would weigh over the first 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, rejected an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in spending was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
“These figures are important, they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely indispensable over the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and that economic growth would start again by the end of the year.
However, Labour’s forecasts regarding economic growth – which will influence the amount it will borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be filled – have been questioned after the Chancellor was forced to review his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion BDP higher than the previous estimate.
“Lost Opportunity”
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning against the Labour’s “duty crisis,” said the project to borrow 789 billion GBP over the next six years was not viable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to refund, they added, "cynically" avoiding difficult choices until after the elections - which should be held in June 2010.
"They didn't show anything significant about what they'd do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet Treasury.
"The important announcement will be made after the elections, no matter the winner."
by Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from the upcoming reductions, contrary to Tory’s proposals that would lead to a faster and more significant decrease in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money collected through increased taxes and decreased spending would be used to support the next year’s spending and not to reduce the deficit, claiming that the plans were “built on the wind.”
Nick Robinson, the BBC’s political editor, said the advertising calendar – such as the inflation increase for certain disability benefits in April next, mentioned above – would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda accusations, the money was simply recovered next year.
However, the Labour insists that additional aid is provided as people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
“False Budget”
Although ministers did not publish the expenditure details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that public expenditure restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institute for Fiscal Studies) has stated that the figures of the Chancellor involve, in the future, substantial reductions in many areas, including potentially transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“The pain is actually only delayed,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the elections, no matter the winner,” added Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s financial advisor.
“This was a false pre-budget report. markets realize it well.”
FBI investigates “Americans arrested in Pakistan”
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. journalists suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether the same men were missing from their home, in the U.S. state of Virginia, last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as of Pakistani origin, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what accusations are against them and under what conditions they are detained," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been aware of the arrestations and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We’re working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it’s really the students who are brought missing,” she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them' uncle.
She said the house was already under local police surveillance and that no charges had yet been brought against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused any comments on the arrestations, the news agency Reuters, but she said the U.S. should “work further with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students had been taken missing from their home by their families in northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian “abus”
In the past twenty years, human rights have been less respected than ever, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The report presents “repetitions of violations” by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
A man quoted in the report said he had been shot and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the previous criticism of its non-respect of human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens have been killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the biggest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozen people have been sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the detention center in Kahrizak.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent says.
“False Confession”
Amnesty International the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of 'working with Facebook networks' and protesting against the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he said.
“I was burned with cigarettes, before my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the election loser candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were violated.
The Iranian authorities denied the accusations of rape, but admitted that abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty has agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the Judicial System create a committee to investigate post-election disturbances and government response, but it has stated that the mandate and powers of these bodies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested over the past three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski trails built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform the Bristol site into a track for competitions.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park track, a small trembling preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a student in the fourth year of medicine, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city shining down.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country – real talents,” he added.
Awards have been awarded the best volts - or figures performed on the track.
After the holidays, the snow will be abandoned.
Always they and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
by Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like the fool" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s last book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he wants not only to know what politicians and media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls “Muslim spaces” for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He knows how to listen and reproduce the discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim Marry in a Mosque or in the Municipality (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical issues, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that worry the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imam, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a Sunni purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia which today, make up a small part of the Muslims of Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the secularity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
It is questioned how much French politicians (and the so virulent intellectual guardian elite of secularity) are truly committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not damaged, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromise with secular republicanism.
Instead of a growing pragmatism, it detects a “threateness of key values.”
After reading this book, we are tempted to say “yes, but not yet.”
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than anywhere else on the planet.
The ice that composes it is flourishing at an alarming speed, bringing with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing navigate in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their track.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who made their proof by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous 14-year-old aspirant who had to fight only the top of his mouse, is a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while they swim next to their mother, just killed, were captured and sent to zoos and circles.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally one millionth of the surface needed to an adult in freedom. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to the algae that were pushing in its thick skin.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often refers to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and motoski Inuit Indians use powerful assault weapons to hunt their ginger.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the ice", Alun Anderson, a former chief editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and scary summary of the Arctic science and a fascinating insight into what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmospherists nor the oceanographers can accurately report the speed of changes.
It is not wrong to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering trips gave the first information about the flooding of the glacier calotte.
The Cold War submarines then maped the relief changes under this.
Satellite surveillance and sondes placed on the icebergs are of great help, but the greatest work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice taxation system, formed by the water networks pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, it may be our turn.”
Marines, among the 6,000 people who deposited crowns on the tombs in Arlington
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, took a seven-hour bus trip to put a simple crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we are at risk of being in their place, Robinson said about the falling soldiers.
If that happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, that’s why I just try to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to put crowns on the veteran tombs, in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the memorial and other people decided to decorate several hundred tombs in the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, to continue a 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen, make each year the journey, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemoration in honor of the soldiers and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the Memorial for the victims of the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation gave more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a dead career soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed themselves.
This is a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It’s like visiting a family tomb.
Dried in several layers of hot clothes, volunteers walked between the grasses and the extended hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient tombs, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, as these are not as frequently visited as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and the couples held themselves by hand, carrying the fresh pin crowns on the grey tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butter nod on top.
Nearly, the silence planned on Section 60, where most of the war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are inhumed.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of current wars filled the area.
Some people were crying without hiding, others were praying, and families and friends supported themselves in the cold air.
Some read in a loud voice the names graved in the stone while others slept to see the small black and white information cards, thrown into the wet ground for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many tears mother on her son's tomb.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio and had spent eight hours coming to gather on the tomb of Marine Gunnery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget because of what we are free... my son has paid for it, she said.
“Long after I’ve gone, I want someone to remember him.”
US citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. citizen who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to get access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5.
The accusations have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested under the pretext of being “dangerous.”
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-governmental graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and they are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to go to receive awards but permissions have always been rejected.
The detention of a U.S. citizen may increase tensions between the Communist Brotherhood Government in Cuba and the Obama administration that is pursuing a "sweet" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first by the New York Times on Friday evening.
The new U.S. policy insists on the Cuban government to advance through concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are permitted in Cuba, even if it is new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average wage of a official is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a wage day.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind the bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press attached to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrestation and detention are a big mistake.
A activity that, in any other open society, would be permitted -- to distribute mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the American program of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a rigorous report on Liberty in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as a leader of the country to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned the same day.
He said any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, at the time the two countries begin to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities stop conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities found an organization allegedly preparing a conspiracy to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan with the aim of killing U.S. troops, saying they hoped that this case would allow to dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who sculpt the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after they found them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of the Pakistan tribal belt, al-Qaeda’s home and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani intelligence services who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men did not participate in the CIA complot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast that became a refuge of terrorism.
They were seen as infiltrated agents.
That’s why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed himself under the condition of keeping the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that the men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to get entrance to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani lawmakers.
The case of these five men — who remain in Pakistan and are interrogated by the FBI — insists on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential and more important terrorists, in determining the people in whom to give their trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence services have priority to infiltrate men into the al-Qaeda network.
The organization’s recruitors play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who don’t show a serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive for the group due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups must also pay more attention in recent years in choosing the people they accept because U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for “action” for climate change
Tens of thousands of protesters walked in the streets, here, Saturday, calling for a greater climate action from negotiators working in the Palace of the Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively quietly, although a small number of masked activists had burned some explosives near a set of government buildings, in the city centre.
On this day when little happened during the United Nations-sponsored climate discussions, thousands of activists walked through the city, deploying pancartes in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, saying 'The Earth says it has enough.'
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the top Danish model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother’s homeland, Peru, opened her eyes to the crushing problems that the country has to face because of the impact of climate change that is already happening.”
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march—to make the word pass and to call on the leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella centre and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or they had pocket knives.
Police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella centre and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or they had pocket knives.
According to a passenger who asked to keep the anonymity because of his involvement in the climate discussions, activists wearing black masks and clothes lighted several explosives near the main Copenhagen channel that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first missiles, followed by "some large explosions".
Inside the Palace of Congress, people were gathered around TV screens to watch the walk, all the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s representative for climate.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international discussions, he replied in English, "In fact, it's something I didn't know about.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, "As the event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that walking could seem harmful or useful according to the prospects.
It shows the interest of the general public and the different sectors in the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others.”
The results of the tests reveal strong differences between races
Last week's federal report on math results brought a good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District remains far behind the top establishments, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are in much greater progress in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what follows from the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the results of the African-Americans and the White, at both local and national levels.
The average results of the White Children of Grade 4 (cm1) in Washington D.C. have increased, over the past two years, from 262 to 270 (at a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) is generally constant, falling only from one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not important enough.
The overview of a six-year period is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between black and white in grade 4 (cm1), when the first NAEP District report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by the group director of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by the white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top scale, which is problematic and annoying, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in District education.
I don't jump joy for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (democratic appearance), a member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (primary school).
Frequently criticizing the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the test results is that the city’s middle schools (colleges) desperately need attention.
Indeed, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what fears is that we don’t spend enough time and energy on our middle schools.
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the students in trouble.
This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, targeting schoolchildren from elementary cycle and college start classes who have not integrated the basics of reading earlier in their school course and who are quite late compared to their colleagues.
Every day, the mathematics program, for Kindergarten (maternal) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they have been set up in the District by former manager Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP last week.
I just think we need to continue to work to offer better interventions to these students of lower level than that of the classroom, Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the system’s overall outcomes while providing money and resources for schools with less good outcomes to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of cities tests.
The conventional policy solution is to dedicate your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also, this targeting may have political consequences that disrupt this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendent of schools, she tries to use the middle class of white and black.
We focus on ensuring the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, no matter where they come from, are guaranteed that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success was the duration of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the Washington District, to be in competition with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the force to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the syndicate of his teachers last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "start point" to get another increase in the next contract.
Make Higher Education a Promise of the Future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long sliding.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and glides a moment from the eyes to the sight of white columns, brick facades and green grasses.
Graciela’s parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never put his feet on an university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students of the group explored Gettysburg where the scholarship costs are $38 690 per year, her attitude was less that of an impressive new student than enthusiastic.
Super Here's where I'm going to study! said Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them to the entrance to the building of sciences.
Youpi, really? she said thoughtful, when she was indicated the low ratio law teacher - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children visited during their three-day discovery journey and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you’re going to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still widespread for the large number of American children born from Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from academic education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, “one in five “second-generation” Spanish students go to high school – a remarkable success if we consider that so many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without graduating from high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they open the way to the next generations who will play an important role in the country’s workforce.
The researchers who study the battles claim that these have a natural affinity with the school and a inherent need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals to their children and who find ways to compensate their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to the university—especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who have no experience and skills to help them navigate in the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a network of support to these children, from maternity to high school.
The federal program that financed the visit to the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that start when low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry gets agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to reconstruct its infrastructure in trouble during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements made by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the restoration of the Iraqi oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies have returned with a share in only two of the 10 fields on the auction.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who made an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies received contracts for the fields to be auctioned in June.
The low representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, Asian and European companies opened the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum forum, an information site on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops withdrawed, have blocked U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering with more force in Iraq, which possesses the world’s third-largest crude oil reserves, analysts say.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged due to their rivals, Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they didn’t have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only US companies to obtain contracts with the Ministry.
The most important U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who haveined strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and gave it their technical advice, are back with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more bonds on contracts than other companies and has returned with significant shares in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal to its competitors and will fulfill its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies to submit auctions made offers that were then compared to the price per barrel that the ministry agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main al-Qaeda organizers was killed in Pakistan
It seems that a U.S. missile, which hit along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of the al-Qaeda operations this week, U.S. authorities said on Friday the counter-spionage.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car on Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to U.S. and Pakistani authorities in the region.
The local authorities claimed that the missiles were shot by a CIA-used-like pilot-free plane within the Pakistani Anarchist tribal border.
They were driving a white car leading to the Afghan border when the car was hit, a member of Pakistani civil intelligence services said, speaking at Miran Shah's phone.
Representatives of the authorities said the suspected local activists had rushed to the site and quickly confiscated the remaining "totally dismantled bodies."
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives gave unidentified evidence that Somalia was one of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the Al-Qaeda’s military organizers who led the group’s terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize conspiracy around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to keep anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside the Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspirations of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaeda leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority said Somalia had progressed rapidly in the al-Qaeda ranges and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the general American public, but this does not diminish the threat he constitutes for us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second major character of al-Qaeda or the second leader of the Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by the CIA’s drones has decreased since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a web site moderated by a non-profit target group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also impatiently killing suspected informers, the site says.
United Nations Special Envoy to Kabul Resigns
UN Special Envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from office in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate filled with extended allegations of corruption during the U.N. supported presidential elections.
The departure of Aid comes as the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN ambassador said he supported this increase but expressed concern over the U.S. calendar for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and that would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the good signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a Kabul telephone interview.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign but he would simply respect the commitment he had made to his family, in March, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has already begun looking for a replacement.
Representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who previously led the UN peace maintenance operations.
Eide’s reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him, in September, of favouring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and hiding evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but said that Galbraith’s accusations – which was thanked – “have damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism regarding the international observation of elections.”
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civil representative to coordinate the U.S. rescue forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted on UN officials to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries than it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them greater confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the boundaries of his powers in Afghanistan, saying the severe UN employment regulations disturbed his possibilities of bringing new talents.
The UN rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it cannot last.
Gates: Iran must be subjected to further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world’s great powers will soon impose “extra-important sanctions” on Iran because it is unable to engage in negotiations on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a plot of 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier about the possibility of such an end.
One of the things that weigh me most is that if I have learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in the war.
The Obama administration is considering a set of sanctions that would target the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians on the street.
He said "a set of motivations and punishments" could be needed to convince the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "their people would suffer greatly" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for peaceful purposes.
In the negotiations in Geneva on October 1, he said he would restart the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant part of his storage of enriched uranium, in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed such an agreement, a way to develop confidence on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have gone away from attempts to agree – partly, experts say, because Iran’s leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Indeed, in my opinion, Iran’s rebellion against some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually given their agreement at the beginning of October, pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join on what they had not planned, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turns towards other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “a greater sanctions.”
In a statement made Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfounded claims" from some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said it was agreeing to continue negotiations with the United States and five other major world powers, "to a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington late Friday, met the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before taking the plane to the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet the troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions continue between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, on borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops, from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
The U.S. authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you.”
In China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by poster of propaganda preaching them, "Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "A baby in addition, it's a tomb in addition."
They learned the lesson so well that the government authorities of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and by the ageing population, radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantly and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31 years old, Human Resources Director and who has a 8-month son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the Single Child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children known to be good and damaged, called the "small emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The population distribution, while the number of residents aged 60 and older is expected to explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and older accounted for 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission) said that fertile couples should have babies to “help to reduce the proportion of the aging population and to prevent a lack of workforce in the future.”
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive relief
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, the Chinese policy of the single child is to date, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy risk to have to pay colossal fines – up to three times their annual income – and to suffer discrimination on the workplace.
Chinese authorities have attributed to the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women with a second child to abortion.
Moreover, many couples have applied to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high boys-girl ratio.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually weakened their position on the single child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule—including for cities residents, ethnic minorities members and cases in which men and women are already single children—and in 2007, they doubled a lot of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research, at the University of Beijing, said that central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In a little bit of time, the posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, at their home, and drag prospectus under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planning manager, the answer was disappointing.
Disappointing Answer
Although officials in a rural city in the suburbs of Shanghai say they saw an increase in requests for dossiers from couples wishing a second child after the campaign's launch, the more urban district that there was no change.
For example, the municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000 inhabitants, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the Caolu Municipality of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to have their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said they would like to have two children and they are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The West erroneously considers that the single child policy is a problem of rights, said Yang, a building engineer whose wife is pregnant seven months from the first child of the couple.
It’s true, we’re stolen the luck of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
That is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Managing Director of Human Resources, said she wanted only a single child because she was one of them. "We were the center of the family and we had the habit that everyone takes care of us."
We don’t have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says it more cruelty.
For couples working at two, middle class, which make the birth rate lower, he says, you need to be selfish to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 have grown up seeing their parents struggle in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have themselves that lifestyle, he says.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You have to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you have to write his CV to get a place in the best maternity."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher level of life, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has plans for emission reduction
The UN-sponsored climate conference – characterized so far by unorganized assignments and mutual punishments – has come back under the fire of the ramp on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations taking most of the burden, in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as long as it cleared the way to take.
But it has been seen as a significant advance in the short-time negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from all over the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a special UN working group, the text does not say how much wealthy countries would give the poor to support the climate warming, ongoing and long-term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emerging economies could decrease their carbon production and what would be the upper boundary of the global temperature rise that the leaders would be willing to tolerate.
It gives a great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what United Nations Executive Secretary-General on Climate Change, Yvo de Boer, described as "the complete image".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to the levels of 1990, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also resumed negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change — to resist floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, U.S. Representative for Climate Negotiation rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if these were not funded by developed countries.
This change is a sign that the Obama administration becomes harder to China than the Bush administration was, two years ago.
The U.S. will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the leading developing countries, Stern said who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be checked by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei said the main U.S. negotiator was either missing "good sense" or "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not finance China to fight climate warming.
With the future economic trajectoes of the world’s leading powers on the game, defects have appeared both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about the saving of individual economies than the saving of the planet, with China and the United States struggling on their respective obligations while the poorest nations insist on the fact that the two dozen of the most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rica delegate, said it was not surprising that major powers are struggling to know who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even if vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make major emitters responsible for their actions.
It’s really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to put pressure to get a legally binding treaty, in Copenhagen, although most major participants say that negotiations will lead at least, to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Insular States, which brings together 43 members, has drawn up a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the Climate Unit of the European Commission, said that the action of the small island states has "placed a political pressure on the comprehensive political process", in part by what they are now united and they ask emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
Debates have become an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most problems in instance before the heads of governments reach an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice-Ministry have descended from their airplane and jumped into the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and news conferences, so that they can make complaints that will be examined during the next week.
The real image of the gathering – during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palace of Congress every day – activists playing guitar present joking night shows of countries that they think are betrayed and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails – is a real challenge.
The intensity is only growing: almost all the major ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the Court of the Great, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for the Global Policy of Conservation International.
Heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a blast will pass the night to sign the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed suburban train in the country will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin suburb train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The small holes lost will become flourishing suburbs, the duration of business trips will be much less and the passage of the aircraft and the car to the train will reduce the national carbon emissions while reducing the bullying on the roads.
In theory, the three major political parties join this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and the fears of environmental dangers are likely to block British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to make for the government a feasibility report, will submit its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow you to get a detailed map of the route of the next step planned for the high-speed network.
The new line that connects London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five meters of the urban area and sites where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger high-speed network, going to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are shown in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to West Midlands.
The line will be divided into two to or close to Birmingham, with one branch going west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast, towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will pass through Scotland.
“It seems that it will be the best performance option,” said a rail professional.
When this will be completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour trip currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial trail is designed to allow trains of 400m length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London-Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space boundaries, an existing station is expected to be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will need to be built part by part.
The trains will first be forced to run out of high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, keeping travel durations between London and Scotland greater than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure passing from aircraft to trains, making it a reference point for the rail revolution.
The taxpayers reimburse the loan of £75,000 for the Tory Orange
Alan Duncan, the main Tory parliamentary member, made the taxpayer pay thousands of pounds a year to refund the cost of an orange that he built in his house in his district.
The party leader who was retrograded by David Cameron for complaining that parliamentary members were "interested", increased his loan of £75,000 to build a cane extension to his second house, in Rutland.
He had been allowed to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not interrogated by Sir Thomas Legg, who carries out a control of members’ spending. Last night, Mr. Duncan said the complaints could not be “more clear or simpler.”
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of the parliament, is owner of a two-storey house in a village in his district of Rutland-Melton.
The nearby houses were sold for a million pounds.
The floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the emulsion office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange.
The neighbors describe it as a “veranda for pleasure”.
Mr. Duncan was not asked to give explanation for the increase in loans during a recent investigation by the Commonwealth Priorities and Standards Committee on its pre-loan provisions.
The Committee convicted him innocent last month of any accusation of non-compliance with the rules, after an investigation of his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the loan of 271.406 GBP from his London property to the house of his district that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about 1,400 GBP per month of loan interest until March last year.
In April, its demand increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
Mr. Duncan’s RBS loan interest rate was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were aimed at funding the loan of 75,000 GBP.
The RBS standard variable interest rate rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to demand £1250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as the Ghost Cabinet Manager in September, after a covered journalist allegedly filmed him saying parliament members had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
“In fact, it’s now national, you have to live ‘on budget’ and you’re treated as ‘of the world’.”
He said, “I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was right.
I could have asked for a lot more, but I did not.”
The parliamentary member, a millionaire since his former post as a oil trader, began to have to explain his spending, in May, after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before he agreed with the customs office that this "may be considered excessive."
A activist grew a pound-shaped hole in M. Duncan’s grass to protest after it was revealed that he had asked for £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the loan last night, Mr. Duncan said:"It was for capital improvements, approved both by the tax office and then by Legg."
He added: “There is no problem with theft or the development or use of the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, permitted, etc.
It could not be clearer or simpler.”
Come and see the Brighton Advent Calendar.
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for every December day, using as a theme, Christmas songs.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17h30 to 18h30, every day, with pasta and hot wine served for free.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is a non-paid priest of the Chichester Diocese and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? it seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
“The idea of the advent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is a place so creative and vibrant and we try to experience and represent it through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for climate
Thousands of people protested on Saturday to demand an ambitious and compulsory deal on the fight against climate warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police conducted several hundred arrestations.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, demonstrated in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, charged with achieving by Friday an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
According to Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chairman of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, has helped make the “political price” of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the courtier, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, broke the screens with pads and martyrs, a journalist from the AFP said.
Anti-revolutions officers have immediately intervened without a reminder.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", those ultraviolent groupuscules which were illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", emphasizing that a hundred of them "was still held on the street Saturday evening "menotted andined in seated position despite the extreme cold".
Parliament party, the cortège, rather good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, negotiation site.
The protesters stopped at about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter it.
A scene was set to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlestick watch with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters came by car and by train from major cities in Europe, but many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue mares" for "justice for the climate".
Today we go down to the streets to ask for ecological debt repairs in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, the Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, waters where you can walk as never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the altermondialist movement approached environmental organizations.
French deputy José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "lease climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cutting between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which houses many islands especially vulnerable to warming, has launched the protests.
About 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down in the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, parade in red, burning bandanas praising solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred protesters also held up to call for energy action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few thousand people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
About 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The voting offices were closed at 17:00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the abkhaze election commission.
The first preliminary results were to be announced in the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates in the league, among whom the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the election.
These elections are a farce.
On his side, Georgian President Mikhail Saakachvili "regret that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Besides Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it as a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the voting office in a school in Soukhumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palms in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region with magnificent landscapes, on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed somewhat everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the district leader, Beslan Archba, reserved a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to monitor the course of the election.
We, the people of Abkhazia, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, referring to the support of Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
On his side, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control on the Abkhazi railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current power or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Worldwide demonstrations, incidents in Copenhagen
Thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and compulsory agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the living, arrested 700 people on the margins of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand, according to the organizers, demonstrated in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that must enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Parliament party, the courtier, generally good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped at about 500 meters from the centre, without trying to enter it.
A scene was set to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlestick watch with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape, Desmond Tutu.
A few minutes after the department, a group of a few hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, equipped with roofs and martyrs, broke the vitrines, a AFP journalist found.
Anti-revolutions officers immediately surrounded them and intervened without homework, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, precising that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", those ultraviolent groupuscules which were illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the wrist by a pad and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to the police.
We see the extremist groupuscules, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the police were turning in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, coming by car and by train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue mares" for "justice for the climate".
Today we go down to the streets to ask for ecological debt repairs in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, the Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry in Africa, there are waters where you can walk while you’ve never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the altermondialist movement approached environmental organizations.
French deputy José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, told AFP to come to Copenhagen to "lease climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cutting between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam has mobilized several figures, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which houses many islands especially vulnerable to warming, has launched the protests.
About 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down in the streets in Australia.
In Manille, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and burning bandanas praising solar energy in front of the mayority of the capital of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, a few hundred protesters also gathered to call for action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few thousand people gathered in Geneva.
History-geo comes strengthened from the general high school reform, according to Chatel
Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "fortified" out of the reform of the general high school, despite the removal of their mandatory teaching in the scientific terminal.
From now on, primary students will have all four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "there must be out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S branch is no longer a scientific branch" but "in large part, it focuses the best students."
The ES and L branches cannot remain subsidiaries of the S, he continues, further emphasizing: "I have not even heard a lot of historians and intellectuals angry about the absence of history-geography in terminal in technological high schools."
On Saturday, a Ifop survey published in L'Humanité revealed that seven out of ten French (69%) disapproved the government's project to remove the mandatory teaching of history-geography in Terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this removal, as well as the left and some right-wing elected.
The minister, on the other hand, added that it was “no question” to remove the philosophy of the terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teachers’ training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass at the beginning of the year an eligibility test that will be on their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will be on their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also follow stages in situation during the M2 year and then will be a first year in front of students as internship teachers.
If you add all the stages offered before the competition, you already get more presence before the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister said he will propose "the individual right to education, something that does not exist in national education."
He also reaffirms the project to remove the school card "from 2012".
In Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge raised Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Higher Normal School of Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, of fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that catches people and gives them the desire to know more about it, explained at the margins of the conference, 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this day who takes his name from the one given by the students to the fish from the school's basin.
About twenty participants are selected among the experts of their discipline and they are selected for their charismatic side, he said.
“We can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel told AFP, who expressed himself without notes, but using graphics, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he said, hoping auditors will find that “the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier.”
The videos taken from these conferences will be posted online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimestral pace.
Payment Delays: Prison Supervisors' Anger, Planned Action
Prison supervisors syndicates called on Friday for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of the year of the prizes and additional hours whose payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiaire (the second surveillance syndicate) asked the staff who will not be in service to demonstrate on Tuesday morning in front of the prison facilities and to "block them" to "denounce the theft of their duties".
The CGT penitentiary (third trade union of the profession) calls on them to "reunite in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong mobilization", judging "hurtful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "additional hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first surveillance union, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), “in call for general mobilization (...) to bring back dissatisfaction and anger.”
The Department of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the additional hours have increased significantly in 2009 and not all have been budgeted, but ensure that the remains will be paid in January.
The Chancellor said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the supervisory syndicates guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts provided by staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I asked the headquarters of the prison administration to implement without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a misvaluation of the number of additional hours does not repeat in the future, adds Alliot-Marie.
The December salary will therefore be weak, except for the management staff benefiting from the famous prizes of functions and goals, the Ufap/Unsa regretted, for whom “budget restrictions have good back.”
It’s a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille has angry, announcing its decision to boycott “all meetings and calls” up to a new order.
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regulated in December, idem for additional hours, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time we increase our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take the money of the staff, according to the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less badly looted than others.
But anyway the account is not there, said UFAP Secretary-General, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "greater tricks" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing to spend his first Christmas in the family at the White House, told the "papesse" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule on gifts: "I give things more beautiful than those I receive."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on Sunday evening on the ABC channel, President and his wife Michelle offer an insight into how they intend to celebrate the end of year holidays in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family's four-foot little companion will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, precising that the dog would have a "surely" gift, according to outlets from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama has failed against her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “Surely not, I offered you nice gifts last year,” she ticked the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to grant before replicating with humour by showing the First Lady's pearl collar: "Who has offered you this?".
During this one-hour show, in a relaxed atmosphere, with the famous animator who was a fierce support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bicycle, but also a basketball ball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him on Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It was only much later in my life that I realized that it was he who gave me this ball.
The first lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn’t know how to arrange a house so I had aligned all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange them around the chamber, but I loved this little doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL says he is in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles due to significant “lesions” after an operation in France, but the situation is “under control” according to his surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reoperated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors had found "lesions resulting from the operation" of the disc hernia suffered in Paris on November 26, his press service said in Paris, precising that these lesions had "needed a repair operation".
The singer’s press service, however, said the situation was “under control,” while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated within 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer’s last tour, Johnny Hallyday would have been immersed in an artificial coma to avoid “doors and complications.”
It’s only within 48 hours that we’ll have a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
Asked by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also says that "such as some sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the International Park Monceau Clinic for this disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, was practiced by the neurochirurgist Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
It was not available on Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
After his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close to Johnny Hallyday, estimated on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad passage", but assured not to make "no worry" for the rocker, who is "a beat".
He had called me just before going to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was a fool because doing twelve hours of flight after such an operation, it’s not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to calm himself, saying Johnny Hallyday “reacted satisfactoryly to antibiotics” and that the infection was “toughened”.
Mr. Camus also said he talked with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and did not notice any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days as a result of a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, at the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated with a "small colon cancer" and then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer took back as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem is abundantly commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulty of the singer to move on stage.
In mid-November, his surrounding family even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/Little Basin: Bousquet's first on its fetish distance
Frenchman Frederick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Cup in large bassin, won a international title on a distance he affects, the 50m free swimming, during the Euro-2009 in small bassin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beat while awaiting a breakdown.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swimming and the other two by Russia in relays gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swimming.
A regret for Bousquet, who walked on the world record of the 50m free, which he holds the brand in large pool (20.94).
On one of the two Queen distances of swimming, the 50m free, it is the 28-year-old French who imposed himself in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first on the international level.
Bousquet advanced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had thought.
You can always dream better and in this case, I had said that if the world record was at my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be prohibited from 1st January.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epopeya in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve this time to the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in big bass this summer in Rome, world record at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he holds on 400 m swimming free (3:32.77) but still imposed himself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russians Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t think about this race.
I knew I could not beat a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: Zola's sarcophage panel awarded $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophage panel belonging in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded $1.5 million on Thursday, significantly above his estimates, the art merchant Sotheby's announced.
This two-meter long front panel at 63 cm high, dating from the 3rd century after Jesus Christ, was estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble “representing four dionic scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satir and bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world,” said Florent Heintz, vice president of the Roman and Egyptian antiquity art auctions at Sotheby’s.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing, but this lot is the one on which buyers have most attracted so far, a Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathroom in her private hotel in Paris, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic in France and shortly Chairman of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Petine.
It remained a shadow area of about fifty years.
Exploring the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "succession Emile Zola" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Abortion attempt from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico said on Thursday that the conditions were no longer fulfilled for the transfer to its territory of the deceased president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was seen refusing a rescue-conduct by the Pushist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister, Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived in Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migration.
The Pushist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to “dimit” and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him a rescue.
But the defeated president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as an invited state leader.
The Pushist government "has experienced a new failure in wanting me to give up my charge (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya said Thursday to the Globo radio, on which he often spoke since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing some agreements the decayed president, refugees at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico has submitted us a rescue request, but unfortunately we can’t accept it because it does not contain an asylum request, Pushist government’s Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I am not asking for asylum from any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to be done as the president of the Honduran people, he emphasized.
The rumors of Mr. Zelaya's departure had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the falling president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their seats.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the government’s position.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government towards international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan socialist president Hugo Chavez, was overturned on June 28, the day when he had organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he had returned surprisingly on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he comes out, he will be arrested in response to the crime of "high betrayal" accused by justice, according to the Pushist government.
Pushist President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street runs, U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up rising Thursday, the figures of the U.S. trade balance witnessing the recovery of both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, technologically dominant, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different panels of the economy, judged Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she moderated, believing that the market was focused on "the half-filled glass".
According to Peter Cardillo, Avalon Partners, investors focused primarily on the figures of the U.S. trade balance, “which show that the activity improves in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit dropped in October by 7.6% compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
The analysts anticipated, on the contrary, an increase in the deficit.
Imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the growth of trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the leading U.S. trade partners, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, the new unemployment registrations in the U.S. increased against any expectation last week, to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has “fall to the lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller, from Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has decreased.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3,482% against 3,423% Tuesday evening and the 30-year Treasury bond to 4,492% against 4,408% the previous day.
Cuba: Hundreds of government supporters conspire ‘Women in White’
Some hundreds of Cuban government supporters conspired the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day on Thursday, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
About 40 “White Ladies”, wives or close to political prisoners, were conspired on the street by Raul Castro’s government supporters as they walked to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners.
At the bottom the Yankees!, "mercenaires!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" scanded, the finger raised, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
They were accompanied by civilian agents who came to “assure their protection”.
On the eve, a similar demonstration took place against the "Dames in White" in Havana, without any injured or arrested.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights were arrested by civilian police officers, a AFP journalist said.
Police have forcefully raised in civil vehicles the dissidents who have been conspired by government supporters, the journalist said.
Interpellations of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand for the release of all political prisoners", at the number of 200 according to the dissidence, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda purges a sentence of 20 years in prison.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of which 53 remain under the roof.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents as “mercers” or “agents” at the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, the Cuban television the Thursday demonstration of pro-governmental activists against “anti-revolutionary” people.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or U.S. NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
A prisoner kills a octogenary with a knife and wounds five in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-knowly armed force killed one octogenary and wounded five others in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of affluence, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the attacker, 28 years old, had hit with two knives and for indetermined reasons, a octogenary, in or in front of a pharmacy of the 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses learned.
Gravely injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to a police union official Alliance, died in the hospital after his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then took it to a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The 30-year-old man was injured and wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the octogenary died.
The day of the other injured is in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then suffered discomfort and had been hospitalized "in a shock state", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the control of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then flee to the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have wounded two passants, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a four-year-old, the latter seriously.
The story was confused in the evening.
He was armed with two knives that he was carrying on the cross behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a head of the Alliance trade union in the Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passengers, including young people, according to evidence collected by the AFP, have tried to control the forced.
I saw a 30-year-old guy with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They did not get there because the guy was hard, said Alberto, a servant at a bar nearby.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Still boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their manager, tried to interpell the armed man and were injured by kick, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many stores are located.
Some passengers came and told me there was a wounded person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I noticed a very significant wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later arrived a third person of about thirty years old, wounded by a knife.
Police officers arrested the man without identity papers.
The Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre has filed the investigation to the departmental police department of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
He was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his guard.
A police source has not excluded him to be hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to take him to the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of over-excitation" as "all the forced of this species whose forces decoupled under the effect of action."
Polanski's lawyer calls for the resignation of prosecution
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's lawyer claimed again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of the prosecution against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a more than 30 year-old case of morality.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced before three judges of the second district of California of serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I demand the abandonment of the charges here and now, Mr. Hummel said, before adding that the behavior of the judge charged with the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, “was cold in the back.”
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who died since -- would have discussed, before giving his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which constitutes a serious fault of proceedings.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally said at the end of September that he had "mentioned" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court would refuse to give up the prosecution, Mr. Hummel demanded the conduct of a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The accusation, on its part, repeated the argument already developed in first instance, that no abandonment of charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski would not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was sentenced, for "illegal sexual relationships" with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never gone back to the United States since then.
The Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be there to appear to the hearing."
In this case, we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
According to her, the filmmaker "seek a favor from the court, while neglecting his authority."
One of the three judges — who now have 90 days to return their decision — also emphasized that “there were other alternatives to the escape.”
Hummel was not the only one to ask for the abandonment of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also demanded, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Reminding that her client no longer tolerates being harassed at every rebounding of the Polanski case, she added: “No one in this room can say that the procedure was correct.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to residence in his Gstaad chalet, waiting for a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, blocked by the dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market stretched between better indicators than expected in the U.S. and the dollar rise: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technology dominant Nasdaq left 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the exchange volume has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which “contributed to improve the market opinion on the solidity of economic recovery,” Charles Schwab’s analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and much more than expected.
Consumer confidence in the U.S. increased significantly in December, to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimates of the University of Michigan Index.
The indicators, however, have been bound by a new rise of the dollar, to the top in two months against the euro, which “draw down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
Technical values have lost their ground.
The bond market has decreased.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3,540% against 3,482% on Wednesday evening and the 30-year Treasury bond to 4,497% against 4,492% the previous day.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month of travel across South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are preparing to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great beauty fair held for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket for the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sports or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real turbulence.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape, it was extraordinary.
I have seen a lot of things and experienced so many experiences! says Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17h00 (15h00 GMT).
I couldn’t dream of a better country to give back my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I'm happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of “deeping landscapes in this country.”
After a month of gala, repetitions, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presenting to this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both became Bollywood stars.
It’s the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful of the world but it’s not just the appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
The candidates will travel in traditional costume and, of course, in a bathing suit.
The show will be animated by a television presentator, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a commissioner for Miss World Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knew to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that it’s hard to match, says Miss World’s president Julia Morley.
The candidates have like last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time on a bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptional fact, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma who stretched their hand.
It is not common for a head of state, note Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful remembrance will surely remain the draw at the Cape (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I have visited people I never thought I could approach.
I will surely return for the World Cup 2010, enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday’s news is “very positive,” according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday’s news is “very positive,” his son David said on Friday when he arrived at the airport in Los Angeles where he had to go to his father’s bedroom hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's going very well, said David Hallyday to the press at his departure from the plane that took him from Paris shortly after 13h00 local (21h00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, said he would go "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following a disc hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following a disc hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reoperated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to serious injuries resulting from this intervention.
Her wife Laeticia went on Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is schooling, to attend a school show, a photographer from the AFP found.
The head of ortopedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salpétrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would go to Los Angeles with the singer on Monday.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurochirurgist who operated the singer on November 26 at the Monceau Park International Clinic in Paris.
They said it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were upset, Camus said.
I have heard of a possible judicial proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said Johnny Hallyday was "leaving too fast to Los Angeles, with the permission of the Paris surgeon."
I had this doctor personally online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and that surprised me, since I had myself two disc hernias, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "parti without drain, without anything" after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he exercised at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorpate a hematoma as a result of a brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor with a sulfuric reputation, condemned several times by justice, in medical accounts, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of Law, and who is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "perfect well" and that postoperative examinations were "normal".
“The operation was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require drain,” he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems between parenteses.
Obviously, a reprise of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, Mr. Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and summarizes the New Centre to no longer use its slogan
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the OPA attempt of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the sequel of the former Giscard Party, putting him in mind that he will no longer use it on any support, under the penalty of judicial proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF label, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after he stretched his hand to the left.
The Defense Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of Deputy Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) who claims the property of the brand UDF for being the first to submit it in 2004 to the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who don’t want to let themselves be deposited, has gone out of silence to launch a removal to the minister and the deputy, summing them not to use the label anymore and to transfer the property of the brand to them, under the penalty of judicial proceedings.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement to take the UDF, the association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You also thought it was good to follow on your militant material and on the guard page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New center+, the slogan +the UDF of today+, also see the signatory of the mail.
As you don’t know, you don’t have any right to use this slogan, the UDF office explains that the NC must remove “immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as from its website”.
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) brand to its legitimate rightholders".
If you did not, the courts would be prosecuted to make the law and legitimate rights of UDF members respect, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF "is a full political movement since 1978" and remind that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP."
The New Centre therefore, according to them, has no right to use the slogan UDF (Union for the French Democracy).
They also remind that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 its membership in the MoDem for three years and the creation of a office responsible for defending the "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he deposited the brand," he was not "more a member of the UDF for three years," but to the UMP.
He scandalously and fraudulently profits of the UDF acronym’s deposit absence to do it on his own behalf.
This indelicity is becoming a crime, they denounce, before ironizing on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by itself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you have no right."
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be convicted of abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses, he has taken advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenary to spoil her from a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his stars photos, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punished with a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a fine of €375,000.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter broke up while holding the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, should be carried out collectively by three doctors.
L'Oréal's heir and main shareholder has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
The appointed doctors on Friday will have to submit a report before 10 March 2010, including whether Liliane Bettencourt could have been in a weak state and at what periods.
I think she will submit to it.
I’m going to talk to him about it, said the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman.
The lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, congratulated the court’s decision.
The expertise will prove that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this old lady that we have to protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane's single daughter Bettencourt has begun prosecution against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist touching everything, whom she accuses of having profited for years of her mother's weakness to get a billion euros of donations, in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, which she considers as a long-standing friend.
While the court had to examine the receivability of the case initiated by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers’ claims sometimes turned to the large family breakdown on Friday.
Thus, Liliane's lawyer Bettencourt three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was neglected to Françoise's husband Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
I have never been able to talk to her since her marriage."
The Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre again ruled that the complainant was unacceptable to act, especially as a guardian judge has refused in recent days to make the right to her request to open a judicial protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place,” said public ministry representative Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial will take place on the receivability of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence will be vain.
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees, reminds the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about bringing employees to "values" determined from above as it was before, imposing consumers the products thought by the factory technicians.
By putting the customer in the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering the markets in place... although the authority’s temptation to impose products unconnected to the customer’s preference factors returns regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects mainly the cadres.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, moreover, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IEA “requires from all stakeholders a proactive approach and a prospective vision”; it requires from employees a commitment that the revenue of authority management contradicts entirely.
That’s why we call for a managerial revolution that would consist in placing employees at the center of the company’s concerns as the customer.
Relative Use of Internal Opinion Surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – stimulate this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately I am afraid that not.
First, because I could see that, faced with a new situation, every structure eventually succeeds, after a lot of turns, to do priority... what she has always done.
Then, because authority – one of the pathologies of power – grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic vision of human behavior.
Out of the major engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the U.S. "neurosciences" and widely spread, unknown to them, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle the “leviers” (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent Ipsos investigation published in Le Figaro.fr strengthens the leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, unadapted to the world of today.
Identification and measurement of mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern, implies adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental conclusion: for employees, the commitment to the company is possible only if it clearly appears as a means of realizing part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis adopt this design of employees’ motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business on the basis of a predefined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life plans.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business managers can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their management of human resources “to the place”.
They thus create a favorable ground for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: 'Justice War' is worth praise to Obama
The US right welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against U.S. enemies.
Conservatives, who broke out the award to Mr. Obama on October 9, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former vice-president candidate at the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, the right wing of the Republican party, to the USA Today daily, adding that she had addressed the topic of war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that were just published.
War is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be arrested all there, she said.
Mr. Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done "very good job" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
On some side, I found this speech completely historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interrogated during the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican investment for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "left president" reminding members of the Nobel Committee "that they't be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's former pen converted chronicle to the Washington Post, Mr. Obama spoke "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as “the citizen of the world” as “he always does,” “he spoke like a US president,” reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bulb that they haven’t created and that they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few on the right to not be convinced, a falcon of the Bush era, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "thin, lighted and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
On the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When war is embedded in the notion of justice, the massacre of innocent people can be easily justified, he warned.
However, the center-left press remained proud in the presidential place.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "must serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper said.
Mr. Obama "proved the discourse that it was necessary," the New York Times said, judging it "both dark and edifying."
Routers: three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, road trade unions and TLF, the only employer organization to be left until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ends the order word of strike and the threat on Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, Transport State Secretary Dominique Bussereau "rejoiced" this agreement, after several negotiations, started on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators had left in the morning of Friday, hoping to sign the agreement soon in the late morning.
And this even though three employer organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had clocked the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting started at 11h00 so that everyone agreed and at 18h00 the text was signed.
The conflict "will have been very harmful to" and "it was to be afraid that it will disrupt the end of the year holidays," Bussereau said.
The text provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
In the hourly rate, for the low-salary, we go from €8.72 to €9.06.
It’s not much, but we’re going very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Or we will give orders to our militants that there are no blocks, no blocks of supply centers.
But we can still have some recalcitrants who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, greeted "a good deal", although it was "hard to grant high wages increases due to the international competition."
According to him, the increases will be about 170 euros per month for the low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of good sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) greeted "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said it was a “acceptable compromise.”
The agreement also provides for the revalorization of the travel costs of 3%, and the maintenance of the general status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will enable the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of €100 million in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft rectificative financial law for 2009, voted in the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same terms".
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to be applied in the first place to enterprises affiliated with that organization, and in the second time, to the entire profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "in the shortest possible time," said Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employer organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a “market of fraud,” as the 100 million euros “have already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax.”
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to disrupt the fast fooders of the next awakening, Unostra regretted.
For the Other, the agreement risks to "cover the tomb of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, trade unions unhappy with RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RER A, the largest urban public transportation line in France, will continue during the weekend, as a meeting on Friday to the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the RATP direction left them hungry about their demand for a premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of shopping before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10h00 and 20h00, due to one on two train on the central part (between La Défense and Nation) and one on four train outside the central part.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change the train.
The Lafayette Galeries, which awaits 200,000 customers every day, rejoiced the fact that “RATP makes efforts to serve the big stores.”
The RER A traverse de l’ouest is the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, approximately one in two trains circulated at the highest hours, and almost no rame in dirty hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no cohue on the quests, the Francilians were organized.
So in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially due to the absence of college students and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "a hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive at the time."
The Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, the SNCF said, which had planned an encadrement of agents and police.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare Station to reach the metro.
New general assemblies of strikes will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, considered "major" by the syndicates, of a meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working hours, career course, etc.
It’s not what drivers want, who demand a due premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals among parenteses, the CGT was angry, stressing that the management "was not fit to solve a problem while in the roads and the SNCF it is done."
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader examination of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," the RATP said.
This also told the trade unions that the company “laughed on the users of the weekend.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the leadership, which so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in a calming concern".
The conflict threatens to extend to RER B on Tuesday, after a warning was submitted by Unsa and Independents.
The syndicates demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain of the deterioration of the working conditions on this line to a million daily travellers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, reach from €2,200 to €2,700 brut as well as €600 to €650 premiums, for discalent schedules, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurd party, heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday the dissolution of the country’s leading pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by anger demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision risks to greatly complicate the government’s task, which has just stretched the hand to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "foyer of activities that are harmful to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the Court Hasim Kiliç told the press, after four days of discussions.
The decision was made unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to resolve the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including his president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the withdrawal of the parliamentary immunity of Mr. Türk and Mr. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party’s property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (from 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that the MPs would leave the Parliament rather than sitting as parliamentarians without label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political vitrine of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, assures that it has “no organic ties” with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s ruling comes as the government has just stretched the hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to cut off the Kurdish support to the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leaders had said a dissolution could lead to a recurrence of tensions in the southeastern Anatolia, where numerous protests against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as justice announced, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large south-eastern city populated mostly by Kurds.
Police shot lacrymogenic grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw molotov cocktails or stones, with fronts.
A hundred people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk said that the judgment’s decision “will deepen despair.”
Turkey cannot solve this question (Kurdish, ndlr) by prohibiting a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow could fall.
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very strict winter.
But the head of the road deblay and sanding service (FES) clearly states that it is not to bother citizens.
This is simply so that agents can test the technique of the vehicles and learn how to master them well.
And according to the meteorologists, it might be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack the snow and glow.
It follows a very elaborate plan.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts snowing on the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures fall below zero, large sanding vehicles go through 20 main routes (called routes A) .
This includes high traffic streets, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
They also include firefighters access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sliding streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES officers begin their service at 3 a.m.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometers of road must be salted with a road founder that adhes well, in a maximum of 3 hours of time.
That’s why the FES service starts at 3 a.m. “to make the roads open when the daily migration traffic begins.”
There or it becomes more difficult, it is when the snow begins to fall at 7:30 a.m.
This creates problems, the head of the road deblaying and sanding service says, “because no driver is willing to let the sailing vehicles pass.”
Then, if it doesn’t snow anymore, we take care of access routes and desert routes – such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come in the last.
Mr. Brauburger knows that this always causes some complaints.
At 5 a.m. the FES pedestrian team begins to prioritize the areas considered dangerous and the passages.
As for cycling trails, the FES services are generally unable to take care of them.
Mr. Brauburger says there is a special service in Frankfurt which is responsible for monitoring the state of the bridges between 22h and 4h30.
Since the steel forms very quickly on these surfaces, saline vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature falls below 2 degrees.
It also happens that the police are calling for this special service when needed.
The Birth of Dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae was similar to the other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped measureed about 2 meters long to 1.50 meters high, its rear limbs were powerful, its lengthy neck was equipped with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with scratches and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues report in Thursday’s Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to have these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico which was at the time part of the emerging land of the supercontinent, the Pangée and was located to the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa illuminates a new day the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, it informs us about the relativity links, the distribution and the characteristics of these.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertaken excavations in the company of other paleontologists, on the site of Gohst Ranch north of New Mexico.
Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the exploration team tells that they sometimes find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The findings have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers baptized it with the name of Tawa according to the word of the Indians Hopi for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a very exceptional discovery: the dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some fragments of incomplete bones.
Not all experts in paleontology share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander from the University of Bonn does not find that this discovery is spectacular, but he says it allows to confirm some theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the Saurians were divided into three major evolutionary groups: the theropodes (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaur and the biociraptor later appeared and from which the birds descend, the sauropodes, the quadrupedes at the long neck, and those that are related to them and the ornithischian herbivores of which the species such as the triceratops and the stégosars are part of.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting ratio of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found clues that suggest that the Tawa hallae possessed small air bags in its bones at the scalp, as well as the birds who are the descendants of the theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It seems that in Tawa hallae, the vertebrates were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air bags in its bones.
Since the related line of the enormous sauropods also had air bags and a light bone, it can be thought that their common ancestor had already this beneficial innovation.
Three consecutive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the Saurians appeared there.
Thus, the three major lines of evolution divided and distributed from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. all the emerging lands that formed the supercontinent Pangée.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, the researchers advance.
Alan Turner from the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of the Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
Of course there are some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn says there is an even older species, the silesaure, who lived in today’s Poland and belongs to a group related to the dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give an erroneous view as there is a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while practically no of them is found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs have succeeded in becoming the dominant tetrapods of the secondary age when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and with many other Saurians.
At the end of the Trias the dinosaurs spread throughout the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
Such a success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There could have been a mass extinction to which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or then, the dinosaurs were better adapted and so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
However, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favoured the prosperity of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and that since then was growing in the shadow: it was mammals.
The Solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatures from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are courses from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the casino at J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt makes waves around the world.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, the police’s intervention demanded by the University’s Board of Directors is undermined.
Last week, the President of the University Werner Müller-Estler had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in strike after walls and works of art were broken with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories believe that the degradations did not justify “a violent intervention by the police command against students and teachers who had organized their own courses.”
The evacuation represents an “unacceptable attack” on the freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing the attention exclusively on the acts of vandalism serves only to “delegitimate and criminalize the protest” and tries to make the reasons for the mobilization forget.
The Board of Directors of the University thus avoided the debates that would still be indispensable.
The prosecutors require the criminal proceedings to be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the degradations.
Legitimation of protests
Young people from the Green Service Sector Syndicate and the German Confederation of Syndicates (DGB) show solidarity with students.
The protests are just a legitimate expression of increasing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary of Youth at the Verdi Union.
As for the Minister of Land Sciences of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) , she took done and cause for the action engaged by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the places is completely unacceptable, she told the regional parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday during the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but we do not accept vandalism, CDU MP Peter Beuth said.
Parliamentary groups of the SPD, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke)
Instead of reflecting on the arguments and claims of students, they are evacuated.
The Left Party submitted a motion that summarizes the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of the police intervention.
The Silicon Valley
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of secret weapons search, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet “Silicon Valley”.
Important areas of production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics are implanted there.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established ties with Riedberg, the site of the French sciences – with the academic institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were mutual meetings and last Wednesday the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a “Protocol of Near Cooperation”.
The signatories were Moscow's deputy mayor Juri Rosljak and Zelenograd's prefect Anatoly Smimov for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of famous Soviet institutes and research societies.
There are the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a “planned socialist city” for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally translated “Green City”) takes its name from the wooden hills in the heart of which research centers are implanted.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
It is not possible to put the scale of the Stuttgart 21 project quite high.
For its supporters it is nothing less than “the new heart of Europe.”
S21 is much more than the funeral of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will immers the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, in a desperate chaos of works for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the spirit of the 1980s.
The headline stations, with roads that ended in the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th-century transportation technique that made the effect of the barrier sabot of modern rail traffic as it took a lot of time to make the locomotives pass from the back to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what you need to do.
This is why the headline stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train passing station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Railway Magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the vision of the 80s has long been not compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of buriing the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
Indeed, the headline stations no longer really pose entrance and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with automotive and pilot car at both ends.
However, the realization of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched alongside the new trace of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Local and regional policies have taken it.
The railway company is part because it is the taxpayer who makes the costs of the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the federal republic and not the public enterprise.
From the urban point of view, this project is relatively justified.
We get a urban space that – if we believe the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and the extension of the section are designed for a traffic of people to which it was attributed – and this is typical of the 1980s – a huge growth.
At the time there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening goods traffic as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than truck on the road.
But the new trace, with its inclinations, is not suitable for commodity trains.
The S21 and this is much more serious involves indirectly many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be engulfed in the project of the Souabe.
This is the official number.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of connectivity and aggregation in the network.
The Ministry of Transport lists in all 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built slowly.
It would be really urgent to push here deeply on the fungus.
But the S21 project makes the effect of a braking sabot.
The route of the Rhine Valley is on the way to become the boundary of the international goods trade, and that is in the heart of Europe.
Government examines the judgment on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government spoke about the possibility of appealing to the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Tribunal on the ban of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to review from a legal point of view the judgment made by the Administrative Court and which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the night flight prohibition in the event that the project of construction of the northwest landing track of the Frankfurt Airport would be achieved.
The authorisation to fly for 17 aircraft between 23h and 5h in the morning, as the Government of the Land considers, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air disturbances.
The coalition must have decided by 4 January if it wishes to file a cassation appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticizes this deadline and tries to press the representative of the government to give him the appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
SPD Parliamentary Group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel calls on the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and which consisted in prohibiting night flights.
It’s very difficult to be allowed to keep his speech, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP’s electoral slogan “We keep our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch rejects the accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel who claims that the Land government is still trying to authorize night flights using "advocacy and rublards."
It takes time to conduct a precise legal examination.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "fast first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition’s interpretation of the statements of its fraction on the ban of night flights is completely erroneous.
U.S. banks reimburs the granted aid
The big U.S. banks, deeply affected by the crisis, disappear from their bonds with the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully refunded to the Treasury $45 billion (more than €30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The U.S. television channel CNBC in a report that Citigroup was also planning to refund the aid received.
The banking institutions are thus seeking to get rid of the imposed restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of amounts, such as the limitation of the bonuses allocated to the manager and the settlement of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors which brought it $19 billion in cash.
The rest of the amount comes from the bank’s casinos that are well filled thanks to the sale of several branches from other sectors.
On Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the Bank of America’s Chief Executive Officer, expressed gratitude to the U.S. taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped overcome a difficult period.
The bank institution had assumed its capabilities by purchasing the Merrill Lynch investment bank at the strongest of the financial torment.
Citigroup also intends to get money on the financial markets in order to get rid of state custody.
The U.S. bank could thus launch a $20 billion capital increase on Thursday, CNBC citing the banking media.
Citigroup spokesman did not want to comment on this information.
In June, the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had returned the public funds they had benefited.
Accelerated elections
Finally, everything went faster than planned.
Just two weeks after the removal of the current manager of the post of chief editor Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The commission wanted to vote last night to make the nomination.
Peter Frey who headed the Berlinese edition of ZDF was the great favourite.
However, the chain did not want to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also the will not further harm the ZDF manager Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the closing of the edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender’s contract for five years but it had been rejected.
Only seven members of the Council voted in favour of Brender's reconduct and seven others voted against. Brender's voting withdrawal represented a cooking failure though predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already left hearing several weeks before the vote, not wanting to bring Brender back to his position.
It was Roland Koch, the Prime Minister of Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the chief editor.
He had refused the contract of the highly appreciated chief editor to be extended by invoking the fact that the ZDF’s listening rate of information broadcasts had decreased under Brender.
That’s why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, fustiging the growing political influence exercised on the ZDF.
At the end there were even 35 public law experts who had ingested in the debate and who thought Koch’s way of action was anti-constitutional.
But that won’t serve anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied Political Science, Pedagogy and Roman Languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Rhenania-Palatinate radio agency) and at Frankfurter Rundschau (National German newspaper).
In 1983 he became editor within the ZDF first in the newspaper "heute-journal" (journal of today).
Then his journey continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was the head and presentator of the "Morgenmagazins" (bimensual information show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlinese editorial.
After Brender's disgrace, while he was just elected Journalist of the Year by Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent to the Board of Directors, Prime Minister-President of Rhénanie-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the staff proposals of the intendant cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political figures members of the ZDF supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had skillfully maneuvered at the Board of Directors by critically criticizing the commission in his decision to remove Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, just as the Board of Directors could choose him without suspicion of placing on the post a political supporter.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left-wing liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Part Success for Students: After a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Countries decide to show themselves more conciliating: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors Conference, an agreement was developed stipulating that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to get out of their studies.
They have specifically agreed to relieve the weight of the exams: a single examination should enable the conclusion of the chosen study module.
Moreover, the workload will need to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate the recognition of exams between universities and abroad.
The countries have also committed to organizing more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master sectors.
On the regional level, there should not be a different regulation from one land to the other.
Less exams
Since the beginning of student protests in June last year, the Ministers of Education of the Land and rectors of universities have constantly in their mouth the fashionable expression: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to have a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board decided to considerably reduce the number of certain exam: "Each module must normally be able to be completed by a single exam," can be read in a document of about thirty pages on future admission conditions for academic cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board says that by significantly reducing the burden of the exams, we should be able to stop the breakdowns, which significantly damaged the studyability.
Furthermore, “studyability” should be, in the future, the crucial criterion for the organization of studies.
Modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if you can’t avoid this feeling of drought that you sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate fraud.
Students should "have the possibility and the margin of maneuver needed to enable and promote personal initiative."
The new regulation will concern access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reacredited" every 5 years, which however means that only in 2015 all cycles will be examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation councils established by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exercised a certain pressure on the countries to weigh on the agencies so that the programs are not too loaded and the exam regime is not too strict.
In some countries, specialized universities and higher schools have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
The Rhénanie-Palatinat is so far the only Land that has given its agreement to provide more funds for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorielset programs to strengthen educational orientation offices as well as exam offices and international relations service
The countries and universities are planning a budget of 10 million euros for this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit to Parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Act.
After that, you will only have to pass one exam to complete your studies.
The organization of the studies should be more flexible, in addition it must be able to guarantee the recognition of the ratings of other higher education institutions and access to the Master should be simplified.
By the end of the next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the issue of the conditions of study in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but criticism was heard.
The Federal President of the Socialist Student Union said he would wish that the organization of the educational policy no longer takes place in the future "through the closed doors" of the Ministers and rectors of universities.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the Chairman of the Representatives of the Rectors Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "Student experience is very useful to us," she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Countries with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Syndicate of Education and Sciences (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn don’t go far enough. It requires the law and the possibility for each Bachelor graduate to enroll for a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW’s Board of Directors, also asks that the countries ensure today’s Bachelor students, that tomorrow there will be enough places for Master’s studies and the best possible study conditions.
Therefore, countries need to hire more teachers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education have not mentioned the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than a note at the bottom of the page on Herta Müller
It is with these words “Arriving in Germany and it’s beautiful, almost more control...” that begins a work by poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematizes in bribes of troubling phrases, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later a collection director in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt on the Hand.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the very desirable poetry chair at the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he is director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Artist House of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the deforming mirror of your Securitate files."
Visibly destabilized and troubled, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his German-Romanian writers colleagues such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner was awarded the German Language Award in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The recruitment trials began insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, “so someone who has not been able to resist the attempts of intimidating the Security.”
The poet Werner Söllner is the informator Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honor of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary dismissals with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shocked and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abys and the lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and spy.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Securitate dossier, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favour.
“He had been able to get him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this public was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian intelligence services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the security spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit, after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have made speculations and will sometimes have guessed what real names were hidden last the names of loans Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike Germany where, in the meantime, the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the heritage of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic enlightenment has been constantly contradicted and barred over the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Securitate archives (CNSAS), but the return of the files has rather traced since.
Since 2005 there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, is confirmed by an interview with a former Temesvar Securitate official who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize award to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very deceitful way toward the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she was asked only once.
The impotence of power thought it could be expressed here, without any genes, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many inevitable questions are associated with the Söllner case as this happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
The heavy reaction of the audiences, to Söllner’s affirmation, leaves hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller’s work, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it’s more than a note at the bottom of the page.
Tombs in the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative arrived there, shot with four spindles coming straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sporting product manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross went at midnight less than a quarter in a Mercedes C-Class, which he just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier at hand.
The man, whose heavily neck attracted attention, allowed himself to go to the city that was still strange to him.
Otherwise our fifth-year-old would have been able to take the driver himself – he had not drunk alcohol and he was not even drunk of happiness.
He had a nice night, but tomorrow he had to go back to work.
Because it was now that it was going to start.
The words of Switzerland that we just started three days earlier were clear: “We’ve reached the eighth final,” that is, in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania,” but we don’t have to let ourselves blind by success.
The big job awaits us on Sunday.
Here, it is about repeating to Mainz the results of the Champions League daily.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have reappeared after the three expeditive goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Tire to Fate
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16/17. + 23/24 February/match return 9/10 + 16/17. March) will be held on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminant entry into office of the successor of Babbel was thus moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only in the one who had been lucky, who had transmitted to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, an endless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and I told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the “spiritual soul” – Gross – the recipe of success that sounded so well but that didn’t have any effect with the nurse Babbel.
It triggered a certain magic, Jens Lehmann – Babbel’s supporters – “in football when there is a new impulse sometimes things happen that we’d never thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the “fenomen” observed by a proverbial “fresh wind” and the new boss’s method of work: “It’s someone who passes to action and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
But Babbel seems to have missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the direction, warned manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart is mostly in need of strength.
Like Gross, the players and the manager keep over-evaluating the victory against a completely outdated and weakened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had a bad awakening four days later at Leverkusen with 0:4 , objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We have not yet passed the difficult path.
That Heldt on the day of his 40th birthday does not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home victory in three months, is due to the weekend events that a TV interview of the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann made rebound just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, counter-carried Heldt, in response to Lehmann's sharp criticism.
He had accused the management of style weakness and said she had decided to change coach under the pressure of puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of free after the matches had been removed.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt sparked and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life these two four years.
In every cast, they agreed for the rest, that is, that without the group's previous work by the coach replaced, strong sports and combat representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “for a large part in success” reversed Heldt and Lehmann in chorus – and even the plastic bag man acquiesça.
World Heavy Weight Championship
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked verbally and gestually the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title of heavy-weight world champion according to the version of the WBC Federation.
The judges unanimously agreed on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title of World Heavyweight Champion.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a win at points at the unanimity of judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko honored his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian has already won the World Championship title twice in the WBO and WBC Federations.
Unfortunately, he failed to get the long-awaited.
Klitschko, who won 39 times in 41 professional battles, had to admit twice his defeat due to injury.
The challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th battle.
In the Arena of Bern, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mostly wanted to dictate the battle, from the top of his 2,02 meters, by his opposite left.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the strikes of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko from putting his dangerous right against into the game.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his strikes rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, having overcome with Klitschko the distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the battle.
He insults Klitschko who treats him as a “bad zombie” who “is not really capable.”
During the weighting Friday, the champion couldn’t stop provoking Johnson by making him fall his sun glasses from the nose “to be able to see his eyes.”
This is the fourth victory since the comeback of Klitschko.
Klitschko has imposed himself again in his fourth battle since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a almost four-year break, he had then defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his WBC belt that he had previously had to leave without fighting.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the United States.
“I just took a shot in this battle and I’m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His rule is to try to gather in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is the champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having detonated the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Hague had canceled a match against Vitali Klitschko which was scheduled to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is planning to play this match now at the Wembley stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Front attack of the opposition: the leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused Defense Minister Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz case.
The SPD and La Gauche (die Linke) parties ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition accused Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately dissimulating certain facts.
The minister intentionally "formed a controversy" on the murderous blow of two trucks-citerns in September last year, said the leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means that he lied.
The murder order was given to total dishonesty of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in substance, the contents of the NATO report which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media reveals, the goal of the lafrape was in reality not to destroy the stolen trucks, but was well aimed at eradicating two major Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured in the U.S. air strike that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Kunduz's military commander.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left prayed on Saturday to Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to make a decision as soon as possible before the federal parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague of the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs. Angela Merkel must clearly say if the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the federal government if the chancellor, the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery has in no way influenced military interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, more and more votes were made to express doubts about the true reasons for the withdrawal of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert, as the ministry had presented.
According to information from the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Guttenberg regarding the truck-tank attack was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have hidden the existence of the NATO report and hidden to the Minister some annoying details.
In the surroundings of the two high officials, however, it is heard that they have informed the Ministry of Defense of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had in the meantime asked in a letter for clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received a response.
On Saturday, the ministry did not want to comment on these accusations and referred to the federal parliament investigation committee which was to be formed on Wednesday next to bring light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some people see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mental ill, or under the effect of the drug, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest during sleep, everything goes very well.
When we lie in our stunning rooms, we can admire ourselves without obstacles to the most crazy dreams and fantasies.
But whoever, awake, experiences the state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, has quickly the reputation in our western world of being crazy or narcotic, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychiatric patients or under the effect of the drug.
It is our imagination that is in question: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes causes the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to blend.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of the cases it is called visions, in the worst of madness.
But even though the trigger and effect differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the chamanes, psychoses and hallucinations are imputable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or deliries when the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain – first of all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – is broken and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delirating thoughts are very often manifested during a schizophrene psychosis.
Earth’s force of attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-wained; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it."
We are in the autumn of 2001 when Henning T turns into a cartoon character.
Their body is in two dimensions in crying colors.
The earth’s attraction no longer has power over him, he plays at the roof.
He feels a blow.
Behind him are winged, grimbling devil creatures, the mouth blamed, showing the teeth.
They pursue him, give him feet with heavy flamboying boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Throwing, ugly voices, crying out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. removes two cables from his stereo chain, makes it a circle and binds it to a rope fixed on the ceiling.
He climbs on a bowl and passes the circle around the neck.
He is jumping.
The circle is separated.
Let it serve you as a lesson, cry the voices in a chorus to take the timpan out of him. “Go to a clinic and take care!”
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first of soon 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers of schizophrenia at least once in their lives; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people concerned can no longer make a difference between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitement, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not too rare.
The person concerned can no longer make the distinction between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signs, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a wave of ideas and fantasies coming from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the psychiatric department of the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum) .
Schizophrene is at the very center of the situation, with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrens often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the ability to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Experience once in your life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved.”
Delirating thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experienced takes place in a real context.
Why our brain makes this kind of cabrioles, is always a mystery for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to momentaneously lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the people involved have small brain injury.
It is assumed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at a early stage of development for example by a mother's viral infection during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplicable is how the anomaly of the neuronal system occurs and moreover the fact that it does not manifest for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, however, if there is predisposition.
Likewise, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When the brain is heating.
What’s crazy, says Lübeck’s psychology professor Erich Kasten, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has collected for ten years reports on hallucinations and illusory images phenomena: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The unreal world in our heads."
Hallucinations are a part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychosis but also an impressive number of many other pathologies.
These include psychic disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, plaque sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising to see that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently refrained; when our brain heats but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like a brain injury or a psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulation, stress, love sadness or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants acknowledged having experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town of Mecklembourg-Pomerania before and goes to high school.
A girl who is normal to say.
There were no images and no voices.
During the recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long chest hair, addresses the word to him.
When she responds, her companions look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears that boy.
They think that this shy girl is a lunar dreamer but Sarah K doesn’t dream, she’s sure.
She is awake, hears and sees that boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bank.
He can even perceive his presence temporarily.
It’s a pleasant feeling, she finds that young girl sympathetic.
Is it crazy? she asks sometimes.
But she knows well that this young and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the appearances are generally scary.
The sights are often heavy.
When she is in class, it happens that she can’t follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he’s invisible to others and that the teacher is visibly explaining equations to the table.
At night the appearances are generally scary.
When, in the darkness of her room, she awaits the sleep that comes too rarely and too late, she often can’t make a distinction if she’s awake or already dreams, if the images she sees, the glowing faces or the girl with blood-blowing stains on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Let me be quiet, she screams to these creatures.
She doesn’t talk about it to her parents or friends, they’d think she’s crazy.
In 2009, Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She got her bac last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has come into contact via the internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she’s not crazy.
Madness is also an artwork of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or has not enough stimuli, the probability is high that he will have hallucinations after a certain time.
I suppose that the brain is not busy enough, it makes sure that there is animation.
Sarah K., a single daughter, was afraid of the other children when she was small and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called dad, since she was in the age of thinking, was not her true dad.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noise, so it’s very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, that’s why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people do not fundamentally distinguish from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrens, a mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises his patients to appreciate hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world that is too focused on consciousness, unfortunately, we have a rapid tendency to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor at Heidelberg and Head Doctor of the Clinic of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but that also contains something positive, creative – madness is an artwork of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of the change of consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot distinguish from the dream even when he is awake.
The oniroid state of consciousness manifests during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience a motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and durable incapacity to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change takes place but the real situation is represented in imagination.
In fact, it is an intense form of means and interpretation, in an in itself intolerable situation, a organizational ability that is given to us, to us men, in order not to fall into the nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as an action of salvation of the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious departs for a journey of several days after the surgery of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen is immersed in a world he has created from all rooms, visits foreign places, travel in time. He sees himself as an elderly man alited in a rail sanatorium, a robot at his bed care for his health.
He lived in the Middle Ages among the nobles who manufactured blood-based drugs.
He is kidnapped by a motorcycle Greek who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
He is completely absorbed into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these indoor trips fundamentally distinguish from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he has lived.
Unlike dreams, the memories from mental travel are of extreme clarity and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience makes the horizon out of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oniroid deliries, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how weak our inner representations of external reality are even in vigilance.
Any change in the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten summarizes "can cause a deformation of what we call reality."
This is an experience that can also be enriching.
The first snow could fall.
by burda
At the age of 27, the children will take the follow-up of the edition house.
Kallen's nomination as CEO of the Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to regain the press group, he told the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company must remain a 100% family business.
Hamburg - The long-term publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly determined to integrate the society, said Hubert Burda, 69, to Spiegel.
All details have been resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will be asked later.
We will also need to see if they are able to do so.
You cannot impose your children on 7500 employees without knowing if they have the ability to take care of it.
This would destroy the children as well as the company.
Burda had announced Thursday that he was resigning from the post of President-Director-General in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
He then took care of the Treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the company’s capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the head of marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a family member who is the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children are respectively 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would have now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s nomination also serves to make the link for the next 10 or 15 years.”
Burda says the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
Ruins have always occurred in the families who have left themselves driven by a capital bulimia, who have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking they could climb up and up.
This has never been my strategy.
I’ve never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely don’t see myself in the role of the country’s preceptor as it could be Springer and I don’t intend to be part of those international leagues like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Total beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at hand.
This is the goal that seems to have been fixed by El Corte Inglés, which just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to care and attention body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious facilities such as Hedonai, specialist in laser epilation, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatments rooms, Luis & Tachi, hairstyles, Marina d’Or, which has a gym, or L’Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a strain of food, with in particular a tea salon, which offers more than 130 different types.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxing area to organize your own “Beauty Party” with eight of your friends and to relax through a jacuzzi session, massage while drinking a cup of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative face, body and hydrotherapy care.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrant platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual “trainers” that guide the passes of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts by entering your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to perform our exercise program properly.
His director assures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretches) are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after making our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the sign Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the order words of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10h to 22h.
Different starts
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party clothes.
The form of decollet, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we need to take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated decolletess.
Endesa and Barcelona have electric cars
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Municipality of Barcelona, created the “Oficina LIVE”.
It is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle in the city and will implement agreements on mobility, by carrying out steps, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In the end, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electricities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, within the framework of the MOVELE Plan, in order to launch the installation of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endesa participates in the promotion of electric cars.
The company participates in European standardization groups and is running a set of complementary projects such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a peaceful future” for the motor industry
The president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, has interviewed “a peaceful future” for the Spanish automotive industry which, he reminded, constitutes the country’s main export sector.
At the presentation of the President’s Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero reminded the measures initiated by the Executive Committee during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Industry Competitiveness Plan, we would have a landscape of abandonment and closure of some of our major production sites today,” he said.
“Through this plan and the brand’s decision to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which constitutes our main export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), has devoted 800 million euros to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The chief executive explained that this investment was aimed at both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized the government’s demand support measures, referring to the Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan allowed to reduce the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in Spain by 6% and contributed to a “strong increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of car collection
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Car Collection Salon, a meeting space for professionals and enthusiasts of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
We will not only find motorcycles and collective cars, but we will also find in ClassicAuto Madrid items of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, at the pavilion exhibitors, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles linked to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restoration, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
External Capacity Test
But the commercial activity of this exhibition will also include parallel activities: meetings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Capacity tests with cars and collective motorcycles will also take place on an arranged circuit outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A Sustainable Sports Spirit
Mazda wants to prove that the sports spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated into the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150-heads 2.0 engine.
This second-generation Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it has obtained as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, habitability, behavior, mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the wheel is also pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control table and the console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and commands, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us in part of the Honda Civic.
That’s why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
Continuing with the habitat, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All of this is added to a large box in regular forms.
The engine’s automatic stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre and 150-heads gasoline engine and with manual change of the six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
In fact, although the most demanded Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not drive a large number of kilometers a year should not exclude this i-Stop with gas engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
As for the equipment level, the model chosen for the test is the Sport, otherwise, the one that has the largest number of series elements.
Among the series equipment, the road change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensitive interior mirror, the board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the audio bluetooth, as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels, are remarkable.
Furthermore, as if this equipment wasn’t enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an extra €1500, includes among other elements of bi-xénon adaptable lamps and a BOSE audio system with disk charging.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is illustrated by the quality of the materials used, its behavior and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not run a lot of kilometers a year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 150-heads 2.0 benzin engine.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between 21.770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23.270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this significant amount, the Mazda3 will offer us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
“First” of Luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have blown us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for Nine's release. (photos: Gtresonline).
Our “Pe”, so sophisticated as usual, had chosen a dark “Lady”.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it’s a device that only allows you to watch your email, without offering the possibility even to see a certain type of attachments or to browse the Internet.
He his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it’s harder to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and a monthly subscription, which is less than half the cost, for example, the iPhone’s date subscription.
Due to its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter and the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is as limited as his American grandfather, but has a surprise.
The price of your monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up the data when you cross a border or desperately search for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult your mail.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and it has long been to work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as to me, I would need to have done a physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The recall to the European Commission’s repeated order of proposing affordable roaming rates across Europe has had a hardly noticeable effect.
Outside of its country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like FonPeek (it’s always curious that it’s called Fon while it doesn’t have WiFi) offers this type of rates, means that operators begin to think differently and study different proposals that allow them to profit their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the download of books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no gallery.
It is a connected device and it is paid when it is purchased and not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: a lifetime purchase option as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my post on my phone, thank you.
I wish it simply because I think it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's Favorite Colour
Yellow is the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
If she went to take office of Barack Obama in the U.S. presidency with a dress and a mantle of that color, she has, in fact, chosen the same to accompany him in the second, without a doubt, most important moment of her life: the Oslo Nobel Peace Prize award.
Michelle Obama was wearing a very similar model in these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling to the green with bright reflections, both times, the dress consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the mantle, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large brodery or a collar.
So much that at first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States follows the trail of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to wear the same clothes.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for taking office it was a thick toothbrush, on the contrary, it was carrying in Oslo a printed velours.
The accessories are also different: green shoes for the first occasion, and a similar, but golden model, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now lifted while she was wearing them leaving the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems due to their maternity
Work discrimination has increased over the past few years, especially for women from young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what reveals the study “Fecondity and professional career of women in Spain”, conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institut de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, does not leave place to doubt: 75% of the working mothers saw their career limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of a couple life and the number of children, whether the woman works or not and the type of employment occupied.
Those who do not work outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, get in couple earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier, and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, decline entering a couple life and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after having settled into a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 in those working in the public sector. “These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to reject the union and arrival of children.
Moreover, the type of employment exercised largely affects maternity, but less the date of beginning of common life,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that grows the age gap between women’s marriage and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who took primary and higher studies respectively were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and at 32.1 years in average.
"A further discretion appears also among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have undergone basic studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have undergone middle or higher level studies reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a pre-condition for marriage and the arrival of a child,” said Delgado.
Diane Kruger is well.
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several products of the brand, entronizing the universal motto "Because I'm worth it well".
The protagonist of Happy Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, comes with other celebrities registered at L’Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
In men, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, Anatomy Lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
Prices of British Fashion
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its greatest representatives, creators and models, yesterday and today, gathered for their annual award, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the date.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, were elected Best Model of the Year.
The Poker of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
He does it not according to the predictable and conceived genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the core of ignition of the character created.
The journey is exciting and Vincent doesn’t save any fears or illuminations.
This book is also an exciting invitation to read and read.
I leave you a few moments here.
In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same I felt without calling it: pleasure against the funeste destiny, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.
On Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, allegoric Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a brilliant, meaningless poetic humor, like the knife lame that almost killed him.”
On Graham Greene: “Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of regret, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of destruction.”
On James Joyce: “The Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the eight thousand meters high heights of universal literature, which must be climbed by the northern face, on which the best alpinists leave again and always taken.”
William Faulkner said, “It was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said he was the heir of a county land owner and other times he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: “This writer gathers the dementia cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did it in the escape of himself and invoking successority with a violent speech to the asticots.”
Dorothy Parker said, “One day she got on her knees and prayed, ‘Love God, I pray you to make me stop writing like a woman.’”
On Joseph Conrad: “On his tomb were grabbed the verses of Spenser: “The sleep after the effort, after the storm, the rest after the war, after the life, tired, the death rejoices.”
On Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depression.
Her husband normally accepted that she told her that Edouard VII spy him among the Azalea or that the birds sing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent exceeds madness.”
On Pío Baroja: “What did Martín-Santos do if it was not to try to hide Joyce at Baroja?
What would Benet do if it wasn’t to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did this do unless he sought the glory of this man to serve him as a pedestal?”
A terrible aggression
Last week, my mother, which is about 70 years old, walked through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed next to her and our dog, a blood-mele, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six pounds, and without saying a word, they sent her two legs that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we don’t see what it’s fun to attack free of charge a small animal without defense that, in addition, was left.
We must add to this the anger of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she hurt these individuals, managed to fear for her physical integrity, since an energetic man who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an elderly or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 17 a.m., one Tuesday as another, in a typically quiet neighborhood.
The dog was gumming the whole day.
We, of course, filed a complaint to the district police office even if we doubt that it serves a lot and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the crazy murders were Spanish.
The indignation led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s happening with young people so they find it fun to abuse free of charge an undefenced animal that gives us affection, friendship and holds us companion.
We don’t know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the helmet wear
Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage helmet wear, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as the two structures have indicated today.
This initiative aims to make awareness of the importance of carrying the helmet, since it is the only protective element that prevents head injuries, or even death, in case of two-wheel accident.
Michelin said that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and manufacture of increasingly safer products” and said it contributed to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new two-wheel helmet promotion campaign, under the motto “To be or not to be”, will involve a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the broadest diffusion.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, since as a two-wheeled vehicle tyres manufacturer, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly secure products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles progresses
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicles market begins to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain account for an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they account for the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to figures from the Anfac and Ganvam manufacturers’ employer union, the dealers’ union.
However, the good news should be noted, since the reference for the comparison in November 2008 was bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebounding of last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous financial year.
Since January, if we add all the vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from tourist cars, pick-up, furgonets, light furgons and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
In fact, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of cases pay through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in the limitation of bank loans, other factors such as the rise of unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic situation should be added.
Faced with this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, the 2000E purchase aid served little.
In addition to individuals, independent and SMEs who wish to purchase a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer can also benefit from it, but the number of operations speaks of itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, it was again reminded of the need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trams and buses).
The association of concessionaries forecasts a year 2010 similar to that which ends, for which it calculates a decline in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency removal is now mandatory.
As this happened with the ABS brake anti-blocking system and as it will happen with the ESP stability control, emergency brake assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are also already mandatory on newly registered tourist and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a short period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, by its way of action, it can also contribute to the avoidance of many back shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's footstep.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken advantage of all its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The aid intervention, on the contrary, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to a EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided every year.
This reduction would be even more significant with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: one in four crashes with injured people would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercises the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize damage.
General Motors expands plans for Opel to January
While workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Saragos) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it will need more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, believes that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the plants are located, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab is expected to be made in the coming days.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the Swedish government has strengthened pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them might be Geely, who also seeks to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, supported by the Russian Converg group, takes importance.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold isined.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder
In order to design their last and precious jewelry, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to minimize it with nothing less than 80 pounds, leaving the balance to just 1,275 pounds.
This led them to miss, first of all, the automatic roof that was replaced by a handmade roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilograms, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 15 kilograms less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilograms, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilograms winning, to mount sports backets, another 12 kilograms, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilograms.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, thus gaining six more pounds and replaced the handheld doors with tissue handheld, saving the remaining pounds.
Although the model also exists with the PDK double embrace box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads of the California secondary network, in mountains, with tortuous turns.
His behavior can only be described as irrevocable.
The weight loss does not prevent the car from running on the ground with an aplomb.
On the contrary: it was a long time that we had not tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in the turns, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of heating his muscles at a small speed for the time needed, until we asked him to sprinter, brake, recover and push his engine again...
Thanks to its direction, both communicative and precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the wheel.
And it will do it with a surgical accuracy.
Motor by will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is successful and can be reinforced with the “sport” option or thanks to a system that modifies the rugging of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at stop or during recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The cover of the roads we passed with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed the chicken nids well.
The electronic assistants hardly made an act of presence throughout the journey, while on some turns we found glass in the morning and graviers, later in the morning.
Finally, an ultra-light car, the most fun to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be launched in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
“Bag Girl”
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer shows her face of a bad girl with as much content as her Chanel bags.
More than a “Bad Girl” or “It Girl”, it’s a “Bag Girl”.
Baskonia offers victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a striking triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the hard field of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences that the Dusko Ivanovic team suffered. It is thus in the head of its group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets to three points was the best of its team (29 reviews).
Vitoria's team was able to fill the major absents of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great dose of commitment and collective work, although it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points marked, largely determined the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blue and red, who took the advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli terrain with hot arms.
English and Teletovic were the main artists in the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but the Alava team chose the internal game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by acclaim and applause back to his former home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to be noted as the best player in his team, with 13 points marked, although Splitter's "less six" rating already made predictions that this night was not going to be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right path at the break, nothing was played, far from there, and the Avala team wanted to remind the Vitoria that we don’t win so easily on their terrain, and thanks to “Elias’ hand”, they managed to enter the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellow taking advantage over the bright (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from being dead, needed to chain some skillful actions to take the air, and it's at that moment that the Mirza Teletovic pistol arises that, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas, returns the countor to a calming score (54-67), and that the locals succeeded in accent at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Avala team came out to play all for the whole in the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not get tired by anyone to take what they had deserved in the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for errors, Ivanovic's players didn't rush, defended well, and although the Israelis had approached in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped in Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
The injuries prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
The Unicaja loudly lost in Greece against the Olympiacos and gave him the head of the Euroligue group B, during a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team has not been scared by the atmosphere of the Flag of Peace and Friendship or by the size of the rival, undoubtedly one of the most powerful in Europe and having a big budget.
A aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who scored the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the internal game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to turn the score 22-20, in the thirteen minute, when an action, a start of struggle, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to work by showing its superiority in both camps, while the outcome for injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal mistakes weighed on the Unicaja.
Internal players and Lithuanian squadron Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, scored the advantage 44-32, at the nineteenth minute.
An Impossible Rise
The third period was offensive for Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, showed himself superior and even managed to match the difference of the match disputed in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, making the head of the group chancellate.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, wounded during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, in the thirty-one minute.
But the victory was practically impossible because Olympiacos was implacable when players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, succeeded in reaching the score to 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new app from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, job and vehicle ads in Spain.
The “How much should you be paid?” tool calculates the wages of users from more than 140,000 jobs offered by Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city you want to work.
Since a week that the app has been running, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker “feels badly paid,” Trovit’s product manager, Albert Ribera, said in a statement.
According to the data Trovità has from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45 226 euros per year and a French receives 31 059, while a Spanish receives 24 000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34 247 brut euros annually in England, 25 751 in France and 16 420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well paid work in Spain is that of servers, with 11,592 net euros annually, followed by the seller, with 14,725 euros, and the worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the Internet over the past three months are the driver, half-time jobs and the social worker.
Brazil has set a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The rejected president must resign from the diplomatic legation at the latest on 27 January 2010, date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, business manager of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that Mel knows he must leave the embassy, where he is refugees since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, after his term, he must seek another destination.”
The chain also quoted the former mandate, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: “My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (which took place by Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that he intended to impose on him by the government in fact presided by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you a lot
After pink days since last spring, during which asset inflation has been the dominant note on the markets, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in a environment where agents make decisions on an uncertain future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetize the debt by direct and indirect purchases of assets by giving abundant liquidities at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been practically completed and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, they begin to put a little sand in the roofs, as the ECB has done, with their adjudication to a year next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the gap in corporate bonds are rising again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize the private risk and the public debt is again affected by it.
There is again a flight to the quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the shelters chosen by investors, causing an increase in differences between the Eurozone countries and Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened a new revision to the decline of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the moral risk defenders, who were trying again to cause a case of consciousness among the world economic policy leaders who had blocked the destructive effects derived from the credit limitation on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is to declare a new Thanksgiving Day.
However, the situation in Dubai looks like a tribal struggle between the Emirates to return its place to power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the roses pot.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that Ecofin saves Hungary from a non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allows a member of the euro area to fail to comply with its commitments.
What is, on the contrary, logical is that the Ecofin has incited the Greek government to transparency and makes its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with a temporary risk premium standardization episode, after some excess in high positions, it would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt gap increases to the measure of the obligations of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European differences decrease and our differences continue to increase, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
When our forecast indicators force most research services to anticipate their recovery patterns and to rise their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, who return to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not raise much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the moment “pregnancy is the mother of security.”

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where these days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is being discussed.
After his speech, which was followed by the speech of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommission, at eight-clos.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest €50,000 million by 2020 and €60,000 million more between that date and 2030, in the event that today operating nuclear power plants would remain open.
If this was not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million, but to 95,000.
In contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue will change, and the power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal power plants, with mechanisms of carbon dioxide recovery and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, he considers that more than 18,000 MW are needed, with other “support energy.”
Galán, who believes the government’s recently approved Sustainable Economy Act is in line with what his company demands, did not want to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging national coal consumption, which contradicts the policies of fighting climate warming.
According to him, there is a “clear long-term bet” in this sense, despite the “puntual” measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must begin to be made, because they take some time before they reach their maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial Wins Air Lingus Manufacturing Market in Ten Airports
Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for land airport services, will play the role of a privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for goods services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol on the creation of the Center for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation.
The alliance plans an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the centers’ tasks will be to conduct research on energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona plays its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is struggling for its first concession highway in Australia, a market on which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The building is an estimated 1,700 million Australian dollars tunnel (approximately 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, this is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a public construction company and automotive concession.
The City Council wants it to be available by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the tutelage of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of the finalists who will be charged with the construction and operation of the fee.
In anticipation of the presentation of their offers in May, the investment is expected to amount to $1,700 million (approximately €1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortiums are facing, with a remarkable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish liquid company, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European underground work specialists.
With the team of Acciona, the Northern Direct consortium is built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturing group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a branch of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and the Galician company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatizations, but entering there is a great difficulty, unless it is through the way of acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the already mentioned Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalid step for the sector’s Spanish giants.
ACS has just won a place on this market with its 30% share in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
millionaire assets
Acciona puts on a geographical area of great importance for the sector, on which it already has a broad presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalinization sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farming park, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the corporate group responsible for raising and managing the Adelaide desalinizer, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground road, promoted by the City Infrastructure Bureau of Brisbane and the Northern Link (North Line), is called to connect the western Toowong highway to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see the map), by 4 kilometers of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic burden in Brisbane.
The calendar set by the administration indicates that the tender will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of the next year.
Despite the fact that this tax route will be open to traffic by the end of 2014, it is not planned that the construction will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include twice two roads, an electronic tax system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers jobs in Hochtief
Australia continues to make widespread fruitful Hochtief, who mentioned yesterday obtaining a contract with the government valued to 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband optical fiber network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have fast internet access and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company handed over the construction project of the King George Tower, 27 floors, in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet begun and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment is EUR 75 million.
FCC adjudicates tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million dollars
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1 kilometers long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia, for an amount of 64.5 million euros.
The company obtained this contract a few days after it was charged with the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The construction is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and it will take 32 months to be completed.
Mr. Rushmore Adjudicates Renfe's Advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore, for a budget of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
Mr. Rushmore was chosen among 16 agencies that presented themselves to the Renfe-organized tender, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom sent a $63 million fine to freeze competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million to France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduits in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has restricted competition on fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and by consumer loyalty programs within the regulation margins.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state enterprise, accumulates more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts on its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday has also been increased because the competition supervisory authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recurrent.
A App Store
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company followed the trace of other operators and opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing the revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
In the beginning, the app store of Orange will be active in France and the UK.
It will need to wait until 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have won 467.4 million, putting them in the third and fifth place of the clubs that have earned the most in this competition.
Manchester United is in the top of the list.
Manchester United is in the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for the major clubs.
In fact, the competition has been allocated 5 362,5 million euros to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the start of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona were well served in this distribution.
The white club was the third in the continent to touch the most money for its participation, and the only one, with AC Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, have charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, though they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of the money by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money distribution procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, the UEFA will spend 413,1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (including Atletico de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, plus 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in final eight receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in final quarter receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive 4 million each.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and at a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça took 2.5 million to win the Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, which are dedicated to 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attributed places.
The champion of the previous year takes 40% of the money assigned, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
Nueva Rumasa Group listed the details of the stock purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos’s capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for all securities.
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which will be debited in 10 years and which will be remunerated at a rate of 1% per year for this delay.
Yesterday, Sos’s shares ended at 1.85 euros; Nueva Rumasa’s offer thus estimates the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 counselors.
Jerez Group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV has assured that it has not been informed of this offer, although the company of Ruiz Mateos has claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If this occurred, the decay would be 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues the restructuring of his management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchasing offers and go and come judicial from her former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as the director of internal audit.
A decision that makes it the first woman to occupy a leadership position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will directly depend on the chairman of the group.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal struggle for the alleged deversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Furthermore, the possibility that in the coming months Sos reveals new distortions of funds cannot be excluded.
As regards the credit to the Salazar, former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the deviation of 212 million without knowing the destination.
The CNMV authorizes the OPA of Paternina exclusion presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized the OPA of exclusion presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October last year.
The supervisory body explained that it authorizes this operation because it understood that its terms adapt to the current standards and that it considered the content of the explanatory sheet presented “suitable” following the changes applied on 2 December last year.
The CNMV said that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the capital, consisting of 6 142 786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He also explained that 5 592 778 million shares were immobilized, and that they could not be transferred in any way before the end of the offer, which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New tools for the expertise of cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a crash are returned to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damages suffered and the cost of the repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of the pieces and the working time can constitute a long and complex work.
Manual calculation of the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including pieces and workforce can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That’s why almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
The service providers and solutions for accident assessment and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of the information provided by the manufacturers, and then process them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other competing companies in the field of industry assessment and information development tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from being simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the last five years, more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than over the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes to the market, these companies begin to work.
This is a very hard work, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousand pieces of the vehicle and register its price.
In addition, a “smart” graphic image of each model is set on which you can click on the different parts of a tourist car.
If it’s a massively sold model, the work can be ready within a week if the process advances very quickly.
If it’s a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have, for example, information about the Porsche, but not the Ferrari or the Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centers worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million per year in the development of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data is recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer different products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the countries, there are also tools for managing the breakdowns or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the leading product is AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution, for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint barems.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it is out of the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the professional industry on the Internet that allows you to auction on declared wiped vehicles.
Its statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geo-demographic analyses or knowing the common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have gone to the garage for a failure or how many have suffered serious injuries for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for accident assessment, failure or duty maintenance.
The GT Assessment Guide is a historic reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased by a rate of 20% per year over the last three years, with a turnover of €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it started its process of internationalization, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the sources, 62% of its turnover is made in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The global turnover of Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera Group had a stock market of $1,000 million, today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been part of the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of car crashes
In October, Solera Group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction included a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of access to an immense international market.
This assessment and sales service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cases and professional sellers who must be registered before starting to carry out transactions.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1,500 sellers and 4,000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the contrary, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collective cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex procedures.
Garage in four stages
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user receives a devis in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a devis and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential part of these systems, especially to convince the older professionals who, in a more or less extent, are reactive to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourists, 109 all-terrainers, 137 motorcycles, 78 wagons and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the required piece is selected.
The user can include variables such as the workforce price, increases or discounts, and then he can print the devis to return it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an assessment tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for the garages does not include the estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be subject to a credit.
Currently, Audatex is working to make these images in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanists see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
