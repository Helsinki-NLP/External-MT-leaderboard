A Republican Strategy to Oppose Obama's Reelection
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth, reaffirming that election fraud in the U.S. is less common than the number of people killed by lightning.
Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting participation.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for holding the elections in each state.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of U.S. governments have enacted new laws that make the procedure for registration or voting difficult.
This phenomenon gained significance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, limiting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the election day, and give citizens the right to vote for whom there is a court record.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a demand.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the Health Insurance Card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters, do not possess a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a passport.
However, it is often more than a hundred dollars to pay to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID.
This is enough even further.
Students who are considered voters who vote increasingly for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who vote more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by those associations for elections.
Before 2004, no federal state required proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic voices.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
Furthermore, Republican lawmakers in 2011 promoted laws in eight states that abolished voter registration on election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general election helped register about 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the proportion of registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aiming to shorten the period for early voting.
For example, at the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African Americans, although they only make up 13% of the state voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter made up only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, who represented 76% of voters, made up only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the democratic governors’ vetoes.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult.
Democratic critics criticize the party-political nature of the adopted laws and see in them as a clear goal to influence the results in the states that are decisive for 2012.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electorate to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting participation.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows false results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of already indecisive men to conduct early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
I asked for the opinion of two doctors.
In the studies conducted in the U.S., there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that with follow-up observation after 12 years, the likelihood of forming metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must truly understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not impair the quality of life in the long run, and in these cases it is more likely to choose to actively monitor the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
They are suggested to be actively monitored and offered treatment as the disease progresses.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not.
Therefore, I recommend carrying out the test.
The most important thing, however, is to talk to your doctor to determine whether it should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle remedy to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and moved enough.
“If there were no smokers, this figure would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Some are also completely unclear.
For Canadian cancer society, fighting tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It severely damages people’s health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting cigarettes, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also contribute to the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, small intestine, mast, esophageal, pancreas, and uterine cancer.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colorectal cancer,” he adds.
The Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large amounts, it increases the risk of developing grim or colon cancer.
Cucumbers should also be avoided.
Conserving meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
Furthermore, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family preoccupation.
“Following an early detection test does not lead to cancer.”
The Higgs Boson Analysis
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused some excitement last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model – our best or “least wrong” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter – but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for the physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it really is the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented at a major physics congress in Kyoto this week, but there are still no data to be absolutely sure of.
Nevertheless, let’s assume that it’s actually the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of being mistaken, and let’s look at what it’s about.
There is a inevitable law in this world that makes it impossible for two objects to be present in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and try not to do it too hard, as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: the Pauli's principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state", where this "state" consists largely of some of their properties.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, called Fermione, who polently obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons are moving, a wicked band of anarchists for whom nothing is sacred – not that principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely astonishing), are divided into two groups: the mesons that we will not address here and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
But it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle" that is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
For when a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" precisely in that place, like a pebble stone thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the "bearers of force" bosons.
A more stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" in order for that boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, slightly comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be crushed by a very large rock.
That’s why a giant particle accelerator like CERN is needed – the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a radius of 27 km! – to such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don’t – for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on its own in the refrigerator.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) do not have a mass.
What can all of this research be “good” for, Ms. Plamondon asks?
For science, they serve to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to carefully examine any deviations between the observations and predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and clog some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has major shortcomings as it offers no explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that makes up about 80% of the universe’s matter (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN so far.
Impact of
The effects of these studies on the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who in 1962 himself developed the first permanent spray laser (the first were pulsed) - has already told us that the laser was initially considered a "laboratory play".
Imagine yourself...
Additionally, applications can also result from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, in 1969 Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it wasn’t the original purpose, this sensor now serves as the “eye” of all digital cameras around the world, giving him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can never really know...
Palliative care – the best way to die.
With its committee on “Death in Dignity,” Quebec has recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon, although a bill is being prepared.
However, there is still a lot to be done on this important topic.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had left him a two-year period.
“They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years,” he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed at the home of palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
“H, it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigned and agreed to help himself with the meal.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greatest wish is that my diarrhea is cured, as this is humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
“Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man pins while standing,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois’ home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the person's ability to take a step backwards," he notes.
Because, according to several people working in palliative care, major events are taking place amidst these downturns.
The patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois Home for Palliative Care all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who take care of them with so-called “healing” care.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die “consciously and by suffocation.”
But through the illness I really got to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she added.
"I don't have any more desires in life," she says before she accepts being put on a mask that helps her breathe.
In the coming days, she is expecting a final visit from her son, who is coming from Italy.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers provide physical care and help with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make death more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
That’s very little, considering that one day we’ll all die.
Here life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral care with brandy or pepsi.
Diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer who died overnight.
This morning his son will drown the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients equally," reports Nathalie Savard, director of nursing.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, no day is like the other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family gathering in the yard and is well supported by his pillow while beating to his honor, a 36-year-old young man, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
“For six months, three to five beds have always been covered with cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois' home come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their life, either at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Great Montreal area, are more or less exclusively specialized in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this major deficiency in Quebec’s health care that causes several doctors specializing in palliative care to face with concern the adoption of a law regulating assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s healthcare system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to switch to death aid.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with severe pain without taking any measures to relieve her.
I fear that patients want to die just because they don’t get adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst forecasts, stunned until the last day.
Hélène Richard’s chances of survival were already minimal when she stopped a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to cancel the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I gave up the fight.
She told me I was at the end.
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who asked to die thanked the nursing staff for not fulfilling this wish after their pain was relieved by a palliative care team.
However, it must be said clearly that palliative care in the treatment of pain is not omnipotent.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Society of Home Palliative Care of the Great Montreal, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which results in sleeping the patient either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will more and more often have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to make me fall asleep,” but “I want my pain to be relieved.”
The realization of this report was possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Property scandal in Quebec
Officials of the road building office, companies of the construction industry, money-gatherer of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great “system” in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafia are entangled.
A “industry” that was very expensive for Quebec’s taxpayer, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has collapsed since drastic measures have been taken," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former head of Montreal police.
The scandal was uncovered by him following an in-depth investigation of the misconduct related to the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which the then prime minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he emphasizes, "the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts," as some have curtailed their instincts in order to retain their share!
The Charbonneau Commission “has already dropped two mayors,” he adds, hoping it will succeed in “showing out the tactics behind the individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
Established in 2011, the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit is also making great efforts with its troops of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police of the “Marteau-Truppe”, which since 2009 has caused the “channel cartel” of Montreal to act with more restraint when it comes to artificially inflating the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has conducted a series of house searches and raised charges of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribery in exchange for public contracts.
The charges include engineers from the Montreal Road Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has aroused attention by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the “system” for the receipt of public procurement.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has been playing his hand everywhere in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, mostly to the liberals at the time in power.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraising for former liberal vice president Nathalie Normandeau.
Canalization contracts whose costs were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribery of $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other officials at the Road Building Office have admitted that they were lubricated by artificially inflating bills with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget filling his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first MPs to hit the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she opposed the sale of a municipal property that was purchased for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to builders in the thriving real estate market from 2010.
70% of black money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will eventually be conducted, she says that it draws “on a thread that enables us to understand how the system submerged by ants works to stop the evil and accuse the culprits.”
She says the procedure is “painful but positive.”
We are cleaning the wound, but we need an investigation unit dedicated to Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
and regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, on his part, notes that “officials have stolen several hundred million dollars,” but is most concerned about the role of “mandate holders who are over the tactics in the picture” if they weren’t involved in the fraud!
Starting from a share of 70% black money in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes, “I was told that this is just a weak slander of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: “As long as election campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics.”
He recommends a complete revision of the system for public procurement and party financing: “We cannot fall deeper; by going to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid foundation with more controls and laws.”
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh about it to take a look into their own backyard.
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
This season, you have taken a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I make progress on your side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
In a game, this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I am not breaking out of enthusiasm.
From my beginnings at the centre of preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine to my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed gradually.
They are taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti.
The new entries this summer are used to playing games at very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to face up and want to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-coaches like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
of course .
Ancelotti has respect for all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has put in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
But we are lying behind.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: this is how we qualified for the semifinals.
What is the purpose of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first in our group ahead of Porto so that we can play the back of the eight-finals as a home game.
Can the PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
In order to become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG gives itself the means to make this project take concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as it was last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we are really looking forward to this title.
Last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry the victory.
We ended the season with a very good performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually, you should be a champion with 79 points.
But another team, that of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
I think this year is the right thing.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it’s normal that a lot is expected from us.
We accept this completely.
However, if we win 4-0 in a home game against Troyes and you still find something to blame us for, it’s frustrating.
I wonder what people are waiting for.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to create a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
In the Champions League we showed strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has failed to qualify for the eight-finals for two seasons, and which has also made huge spending!
In terms of the amounts invested, you were believed to be 15 points ahead of the break!
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were “boosted” by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winners and tell ourselves that we finally won them despite all the difficulties.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It is better to speak of a “zlatan dependence.”
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores a lot of goals.
That’s why he came and he proves he’s the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the world’s best defenders, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
It was in my heart to participate in this.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from spending some game time.
I have seen things that have strengthened me.
Today, I can make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since I was baptized with the "blues".
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we must demonstrate an exemplary behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and encourages to win.
Just like Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the forced draw in Spain on 16 October (1:1) a start-up game?
This game gave me confidence.
Everyone has fought for everyone else.
Before this match in Spain, I had never seen a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often happens in these technologies, there is a tangible political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, shaped by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows for direct file exchange.
With 15,000 computers on the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin reached a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell to $2 five months later before recovering to around $10 today (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes Bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competing with the dollar or euro” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that are used to advance in a video game that can be won or bought (and sometimes exchanged back) through games.
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
However, trading is controlled and handled each time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously invoice keepers, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public account billbook spread across the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is launched on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, possessing the privilege of adding that additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that results in a particular fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the correct one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a fraud user wants to pay twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked as they both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the task receives 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to one hundredth of a millionth, leaving a certain amount of space.
In addition, the difficulty of the task increases with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
“The exploited vulnerability doesn’t affect the actual protocol,” assures Pierre Noizat, who just introduced Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Major actors such as Wikipedia reject donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others such as the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the billbook and showed that 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
A mega final sale was launched in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with traders, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to provide an address that can be “photographed and recognized” by a phone, Pierre Noizat says, assuring that he has thousands of users.
There is a common trend to rethink hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontally oriented systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
By the way, the ECB intends to re-evaluate the various risks currently considered to be high in the event of a success of this currency.
We have withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And then then?
French troops have left their areas of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we punished the Afghan farmers by regarding them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the wounded and defeated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who deny an armed foreign presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though they have joined jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek and Tajik.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there as Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almonds, financed with French loans, took place properly.
The truck and tank convoys overflyed by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
At the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban attacks in Kabul.
Since their irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed by war due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups.
Their seizure of power was then seen as a kind of liberation and a return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war came to power again in 2001.
They turned into businessmen by confiscating government land to sell it as a construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive American subcontracting.
They were deceived, and most of them were not involved in the battles themselves.
As I’ve heard in the campaigns, people want a government that isn’t made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who were able to take advantage of American grants: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have been in contact with the modern world and have its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties, is obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
There is an army now.
Will the authorities under whose command it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already working to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization following the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the prime minister’s office, which existed since the 1964 constitution, the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long ago.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional irrigation plants are absent, and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Private initiative is given priority.
In a country plagued by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor has spread that Afghanistan has enormous mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only in place to take advantage of it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have almost left Mes Aynak’s copper mines, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to do their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s main employers.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to re-establish normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and youth gymnasia, Institute of French at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of “civil-military action” of the Ministry of Defense (CIMIC), which was hired in 2012, has carried out in dozens of mountain villages numerous non-profit works and measures for the restoration of agriculture and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization in an attempt to win the “hearts and spirits” and the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions.
These works, which required numerous local workers, were able to help suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave back after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving the local living conditions, which are very tough in these valleys often at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for the farmers to free themselves from the rebellion led by foreign groups, which they say is their own desire, the continuation of small, well-controlled and directly affecting civilian aid in their favor would be necessary.
A Constitution with the Breachstange in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration granting him temporary unlimited powers, he has decided to put everything on a single card.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
Egypt has now been relying on a provisional text that has been amended several times for almost two years, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal mess.
This new initiative has only caused an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "step the right with his feet".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time forcing the brothers to give up their plan of explaining the text to the Egyptians section by section.
For the president, it is also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy as protests tumble across the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly Time show, Mohammed Mursi appears to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum with this recourse to a rushed vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited powers", the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constituent assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the liberals did not accept the request.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they turned away, believing that they were unable to put their views into practice.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted in the same way.
In order to the decision capacity, 11 members, deputy members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly unanimously adopted.
The commentators, by the way, found it entertaining that the only disagreement of the day ... was expressed in the time for prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum of the constituent assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that “the principles of Sharia are the main source of law.”
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made more stringent application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
“Holyness” replies to the liberals, who see this only as a blow of propaganda.
Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place over other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, as "the people who are called for an opinion are not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
Here can be seen the first signs of a theocracy.”
The liberals’ fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system,” reassures Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He acknowledges, however, "that there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One refers in particular to the fiqh [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticized for the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue is the powers of the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military, the audit of the defence budget is not submitted to parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as human rights groups have demanded.
The latter also share their concerns about the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The fact of blasphemy isined, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no more articles refer to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the navel of the world and a sea of sunshine
The Promised Land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and unspoiled nature.
AIF lists the top five reasons to visit Israel.
before the holy places.
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bath in this river will receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding feast, the walking on the water, the shutdown of the sea tower, and the fishing.
This is where Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
Most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers take the Passion Way of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretory, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the ointment stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the Wall of Lamentation, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which then go into fulfillment.
Take a journey to the heights
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 AD.
They lie on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else brings an airway to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 meters is the famous ski resort Hermon, which attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods allegedly lived on the mountain summit.
Visiting unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
On one trip, not all of them can be visited.
However, at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
The Israeli Museum is located near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are stored ancient Qumran manuscripts or rolls from the Dead Sea found in rock caves in the Jewish desert, as well as about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There is a collection of works by the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum at Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bath servants.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most striking section is the Children’s Monument, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
When you enter the room, there is complete darkness.
The stars glitter.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died were heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Do something for health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three locations there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinaries and oceanaries.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also swimming in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and it is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea, with a location of 417 meters below sea level, is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise water has a high salt content and thus carries even non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using saltwater (natural saltsole) and medicinal sludge as well as to treat skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and to calm strained nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
These secrets are hidden in the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous sea route connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda here, with whom he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets named after the zodiac signs.
Fortuna is said to be the legend after all who touch the walls in the street with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newly married couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre now hosts evening concerts and operas.
Listings for tourists
If you’re traveling to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is preferred not to be taken in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be exchanged in shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
The city is mostly accessible by bus, but there is also a high-speed tram in Jerusalem and Haifa is the only six-stop subway line in the country that connects the suburb with the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground railway station.
A ride within the city costs, regardless of the means of transportation, 6 shekels, which is enough including switching for a ride of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, Saturday is celebrated in Israel.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
On Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without shell, and foods that contain both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between various dishes featuring hammer and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried beans and pears (Falafel), as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-nourished cats that roam around the streets comfortably and unhappy.
In the evening, you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Cats like busy places and don’t say no to delicacies.
A rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80), depending on the brand.
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And renting bicycles costs 15 shekels per day.
Entrance tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists arrived in the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the abolition of the visa requirement on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MPs and civil rights activists are discussing the benefits of mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already trading with fake certificates.
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the maintenance of the families left at home.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every working migrant must pass a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this scheme only applies to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing sector and in the retail sector.
However, the tests will eventually become mandatory for all guest workers, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
This requires not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language proficiency must be demonstrated for both obtaining and renewing the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempt from this law are persons who obtained their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problem and protection of rights
All exams will be conducted under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can pass the tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Agency.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, repeatedly asked the press the following question before the law came into force: What does it bring?
What changes does the requirement to demonstrate language proficiency bring for both Russians and guest workers?
First and foremost, spokesmen of the Migration Authority respond, it is about reducing the number of forced laborers.
“Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers,” says Viktor Sebelew, head of the representation of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan.
However, your rights must be protected before you leave.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants face problems without work, education, language skills and medical examination.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, who, under the pretext of help, will put him in a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure for dozens of months without food and documents and create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"In your homeland you are promised one, and upon arrival you are cheated, your passports are taken away and you do not receive the promised salary," Tolib Schwaripov, head of the head office for labour migration of the Tajik Migration Authority, confirmed.
Do not cheat, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, admit that they not only do not master the language of the destination country, but also can hardly express themselves in their own language in writing.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbek and Tajik can afford even a reasonable elementary education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school items.
As a teenager, these children immediately take advantage of the first opportunity to earn money.
“It’s hard without language skills,” they admit.
“You feel humiliated and inferior.”
Civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect regarding the law.
The test must only be passed by legal immigrants.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers continue to stay illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Entry for unauthorized persons prohibited"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic barriers and, of course, language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The Russian police know that most of our documents are fake and we are not registered, and this leads to cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
“Don’t pay for fake papers.”
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be fake.
Some fake certificates certifying the passing of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed using a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to save himself from the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
That’s more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs a working migrant three thousand rubles.
That the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and civil rights activists agree.
For now, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time to get time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where no active communication with people is required.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs ignores the illegal weapons market
The proportion of legal weapons in crimes is extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning to tighten the gun laws for private gun owners.
With this, the authorities respond to recent events: wounded in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the shooting of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradov.
Police want to ban non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the Chairperson of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted to the Duma soon.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, the authors of which - representatives of various weapons associations - urge the authorities to refrain from "senseless tightenings".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal rights officer, Vasily Lesnikov, to the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes with the use of registered weapons were committed over the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals from using themselves on the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, in Moscow you can find every possible weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the interior ministry stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen both by the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez said.
On the second channel come illegal weapons, which are stolen from law enforcement officers by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen both from police armor chambers and directly from law enforcement officials.
Other weapons sold illegally come from military arms warehouses.
There were frequent explosions in military camps.
"There's evidence that in some cases it was firefighting to cover up the lack of weapons," the former military official said.
According to Baranez, weapons manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that cannot withstand international competition and therefore waste the weapons at hand on the black market, such as in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own, sometimes handicapped production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military official.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the approximate share of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was drafted by the Center for Problem Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminal literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons.
The majority of the illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there due to "the fault of those responsible who have come to deal with weapons in their work," the report says.
According to the researchers’ data, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% come from theft in weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at an arms store, who does not want to be named by name, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long been no longer purchased because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for merchants to obtain the surcharge in an arms warehouse.
A weapon, for example, a pistol type TT, is purchased through a funnel.
The weapon is exhibited and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the weapon to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know everything and therefore, if they can not comply with the plan to detect crimes, periodically conduct check purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons," adds the sales adviser.
Like in a luxury store.
Buyers and sellers are most often familiar with each other.
I had looked at my websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested to come to the “Begowaja” station where a person would wait for me to take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
I only found out the price of the gun.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales adviser. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are merchants in the markets, but there you have to go and make an appointment with a code such as "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets you tell that the daughter has lost a tooth."
Currently I even get to some beatings about a friend I trust.
He also gives me the beats just because he knows I’m not beating him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranez attempted to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
The schemes have not changed, according to him.
He got a photo album depicting “everything possible.”
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” the military recalled.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don’t just buy, but I go to the forest with the seller, and there we set up a target disc.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No papers are required and no personal meetings are required.
"You only need the right amount of money," it says in the ad on the website "Buy combat pistols or rifles".
There, users place their orders and make requests.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," asks user "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently blocked countless web pages, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service.
People come like hungry fish to feed and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shell coal.
Military commentator and former military official Viktor Baranez
I heard of the following scheme: The website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Responsible persons accept orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM.
"As a response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie".
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that in the end, you can also go out empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently blocked countless web pages, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service.
"People come like hungry fish to feed and then land in the Siberian labor camp and are allowed to shuffle coal," he says.
Makarov for $100
According to experts, the purchase of illegal firearms is expected to cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a Makarov-type gun for $100 to $300.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is distributed in military arms warehouses by mid-range supervisors.
According to official statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons across Russia decreased by 7% in the period from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of uncovered cases of theft and blackmail related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the US
One in four U.S. teenagers is sitting behind the Mc Donald’s box at some point
In recent days there have been massive protests across the United States against low wages at Walmart branches and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict if the protests will continue to swell or if they will soon run out of the air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several leftist non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing unions.
Until now, this industry has hardly been organized by trade unions.
46 cents a year.
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, when sales took place in the United States that attracted millions of customers, sometimes leading to crowds.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, left their jobs and, along with trade unions and leftist activists, covered branches of the chain whose target group is low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets.
That’s why many of Walmart’s low-paying employees only purchase from their own workplace.
The price and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods so cheaply only because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of tough working conditions, such as the lack of folders or hand scanners.
Participants in the “Black Friday” protests called for wage increases and expressed their anger over the fact that the contribution to corporate health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee earning $9.5 an hour could not afford that increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley show that if the company raised the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than they donate for salary now.
If Walmart completely transferred the salary increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, this would be an additional expenditure of just $12.39 per year compared to today.
Walmart supporters are pleased to note that there were protests in only nine states and they did not cause any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 p.m. on Thursday evening to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cash registered 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-leaning Huffington Post website that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees quit the work and the protest was merely “another PR trick” by the trade union that organized the protests.
“Free box!”
The protests continued this week in New York, where, however, their targets were not Walmart stores (which are not desirable in this progressive city and therefore do not exist until now), but McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald’s says the company sells billions of servings, and yet you are not given sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, under federal and New York legislation, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually increased, but not too much, and on average, their ordinary employees in New York receive $8.90 an hour.
No one deserves less than you in this expensive city.
How it is possible to live in New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when a quarter of all U.S. youths were back at McDonald’s after school, but the youths still lived with their parents.
Few saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald’s employees, I constantly encounter people who complain that they can handle that salary and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began Thursday at 6.30am in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashers and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, more than doubling the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
U.S. law prohibits corporate management from obstructing this goal and dismissing or dismissing trade union members.
On the other hand, business management does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff fluctuation.
dissatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a midday gathering in front of the McDonald's at Times Square, at which some local Democrats spoke, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and yet you are not granted sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor's candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support fast food workers so that they can get a fair salary and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on the spot, not all of whom are employed in the fast food industry, which employs tens of thousands in New York.
It is unclear whether the flash of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
“The brain can only be overlistened in moderation.”
The theme of augmented reality, popular with supporters of modern technologies, is most recently usually perceived by the lens of a special glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
Speaking with Shahram Izadi, the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at Microsoft’s Cambridge laboratory, it became clear that the glasses were just a transit station for the company’s scientists.
It attracts the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual open spaces.
Please describe briefly what research your group is conducting.
- We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, but we want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, mankind has largely been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look forward to 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a progress, and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
What awaits us in the future?
Although Kinect has brought interaction to a physical level, much is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output so far not decisive.
We try to change that by working on real three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We must release the computer world into our physical world and make it more comprehensible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of this ugly virtual reality helmet!
What do you think about language control?
It is popular, but is it not overvalued?
- It is not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone around you about your actions and intentions.
In fact, any type of interaction with computers is good, but each in its specific niche.
For example, in the field of controlling objects in public spaces, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and concise gestures instead of unloading.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed controls, such as gestures and language.
How that?
- Would we ask you, for example, to give you this sprinkled box?
They say it and mean it at the same time.
Usually I just say it.
Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Does that mean you want the user to adjust to what a machine can do at a given time and what not?
Not necessarily, but it is about mutual approximation.
I think in the near future we will need to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to capture people’s reactions more accurately.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
What are your demands from working with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Thus, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
It is necessary to consider not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and, frankly, the current 30 fps are not enough, especially for gestures.
In our laboratory in Redmond, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with a regulable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work, I needed just such a device, just without a touch control and with more images per second.
Should the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cams", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras could solve the problem.
Or aggravate the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to see how this helps us determine a three-dimensional position.
Unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of augmented reality technology in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand on the go, but I think the following: The greatest variant would be a "changing" augmented reality where we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone over a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and in this is their strength (private ones can only be seen by you), but at the same time their weakness, because augmented reality using glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is one problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands do not feel anything.
What response does your group want to give to this objection?
In my lectures, I often talk about augmented reality as the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth breakthrough could quite well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of second hand as a somewhat unusual projection substrate.
She takes pressure very well!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the “images in the air” something of handy, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays at a particular point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is still as weak at the moment as someone is blowing over the handballs.
There are also ligaments for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, too, this is a potential direction.
Have you tried to overtake the brain?
Does it think that it feels what it should feel when it is seeing something?
That’s a good idea, so we haven’t tried it yet.
Here lies another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed space believe that instead he is in an open, virtually infinite space; here we are working on concepts with running tapes (other than in gyms), moving platforms, as well as large balls.
So far, the brain can only be overstated moderately, and there are still many years of work ahead of us.
This is what makes work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg Avant-garde", dedicated to urban residents who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
The list already included high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the limits of the city and often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
Rosbalt’s new hero is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed bearded man, who can be encountered at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at the scene meetings or at the decorations.
Wherever Kirill Miller’s paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical St. Petersburg social philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the St. Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and, by his presence on the street, brings a smile to his fellow citizens and gives them a good mood.
Recently he grabbed a filming organ and became a St. Petersburg filming organ as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistic existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer that deals with the optics and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, anything that deviates slightly from the grey norm provokes aggression and bad behavior.
I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
When did you know you needed to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Newskij Cultural Palace, where my works were exhibited.
I knew I had to go that way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters then came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I made friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of "Gazonevskina"; from this came "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was over.
It attracts me to theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything but literature.
It was important for me to be at the center of St. Petersburg’s culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there, up to the renovation works, there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemians, the house of the St. Petersburg Bohemians.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight shirts and included the modern composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but the basics he learned with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origins in the art clinic.
There were our staff and guests.
I am a hero of the last century when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a poll in the press about the award "Personalities of our city".
I won the "Artist of the Year" category, and I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays it’s easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
Your work has an indisputable style.
Many of my paintings are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on the subject "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares fear to be so.
In a clown, everything is wiped out and loses its tragedy.
I love grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by prescribing that everyone should fully dress.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and focuses on the outside and not the inside of the person.
But one should not give a hand to a man, but should spit in his face.
The deception disappears through dressing.
- Recently, we saw you in the role of the urban orchestrator. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who if not me?
Can art be beautiful too?
Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate, and lustful.
We see the decay of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the ordinary people loved the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it’s hard to please everyone.
I’m not a $100 note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you will like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- But the performances of Stas Mikhailov come several thousand!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, consequently, there is less management, money, and everything is destroyed.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to fool them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted such paintings, which at a collector even hanged in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of my career.
There are often misunderstandings nowadays.
It is called intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something completely different.
I am a man of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
What is missing in St. Petersburg?
Good cultural experts.
They are called servants of culture.
However, not everyone can deal with culture.
With the real tsars it was different, because the tsars might not understand much of culture, but they understood that the right experts are needed.
There are good advisors in Moscow.
In St. Petersburg, we have those who could be experts, but they are blocked the way because they need higher-level experts to properly evaluate the first and pave the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same goes for the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say they do not embrace all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding nutrient ground.
On our stones, art can hardly grow.
We need a cultural ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe, there are many curious people who attend exhibitions or concerts.
With us it is much less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by the city of St. Petersburg.
Birth in Space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with Earth inhabitants on board embark on a search for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, the important question arises, how can we reproduce in gravity or on the replacement planet?
I do not think there are many options.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
“Mars and Venus,” says Wladimir Surdin, a scientist at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The question of reproduction in space was first addressed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were conducted with plants.
The fourth generation of peas grown in orbit did not differ at all from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, weed eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
A normal chicken is developing.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chicken has to find a stop; it has to be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid underground, the chickens overwhelmed wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely dimmed.
The chickens did not react to light and noise.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Two times we slapped chickens and then stopped the whole, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychew about the failed experiment with the chickens in space.
The last cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" will be only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that had already been fertilized in space.
In principle, nothing special was noted.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to continue," notes Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats got offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals who are ripped out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive urge.
Unlike animals, humans are able to do so.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
The most precious thing that mankind possesses is the female organism.
Our frog flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the question: Does it survive space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
“Ultimately, nobody answered this question,” said space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after her spaceflight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, gave birth to a daughter.
The child’s father, Andryan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was in orbit twice and even did work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
However, there remains a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts who, after long flights, went well and had healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity has to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolab in the cosmonaut preparation center is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in the open space.
Water is the weightlessness.
Although adults find water pleasant, it is a strange environment; yet infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders were testifying that life on land escaped the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the womb of the mother in the amniotic water, and that then it is easier to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swimming only 2 weeks pass.
“That’s too little time to forget something,” says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
Thus, while for a newborn child, weightlessness is a much more natural condition, the woman does not go without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles are formed tremendously quickly, and with it, the ability to compress the child also decreases.
Well, let’s get around this through birth initiation tools.
Birth, for example, could also take place in a special chamber to suppress the child.
"But what happens then?" is Valery Polyakov's not insignificant question.
Children also need artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth drawing, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a load suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply miss what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment, which we are conducting together, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us giving birth to a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person," predicts Igor Pestov, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
Until now, the birth of children in space is only a theory.
At some point, it will become a reality when the Earth’s inhabitants embark on their spacecraft to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
NKÚ chief: control of the black system fails because of the blame of politics
The Czech Republic has good supervisory bodies and adequate laws in relation to public procurement, but falls short in their application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, this is stated by the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
“A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly – and in my opinion this is not the case with us,” Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar outcome appears to be a joint audit by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practice example, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called “black system”.
Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the president of the government can not simply come, and the control office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, hinder his activity," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public procurement were compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel examination that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is the European legislation that determines how public procurement should be handled.National legislation is based on this.
We compared all of this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we were able to find very interesting differences.In general, the laws may even be somewhat "stricter and more perfect" with us, but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to constantly set up new and more precise rules; one must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can this project help you?
Such a joint control could help us to stop constantly striving to improve the laws and to lower and adjust thresholds, if this does not obviously have a very positive effect.
Economics means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering the thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will that goal.
Per it’s even so that in this way we only load the system with excessive “paperwork,” and those looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here to our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As for the authorities, the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similarly structured as ours and also has a college that is only formed slightly differently.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, although Germany is a federal state, i.e. that these courts of account also exist in the individual federal states – in this the German system differs from our own.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which correspond to our state funds.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the Land Court of Auditors.
Is the German law easier than ours?
Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a model in some respects, but one can not say that Germany is better in everything.
Is it because the inspectors are better?
As I said, I don’t like such comparisons.
In this regard, it should be noted that those countries that are an example for us also have problems.
Otherwise, you’t have any cooperation with our authorities, right?
As for the Czech legislation, what impact has the amendment of the Contracting Act had on your authority, do you feel any impact?
Given that this novel is only in effect for a short time, it does not yet have an effect on our audits.
As our checks take place subsequently, we have to expect some delay here.
The impact is most likely to be felt so far in the preparatory phase of future controls – so we introduced the new control tool “identification of risks of ineconomicity” and used it to examine and analyze 14,000 public contracts – where the changes will have an effect, as thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among others.
Do you see the adoption of this law as more positive, or is the system burdened with more bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, there may be the problem that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be followed.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an audit are liable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, to the Regional Council) in such a way that any non-compliance with the procurement law constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to make the law stricter?
Not in this way, in my opinion.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
Let us first say which path is not effective.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not involve entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does this mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government can not simply come and hinder the control office, whose duty is to control the observance of the law, in his activity.
He can say, “We change the law and allow the thing,” but he can’t say that we act as if nothing were.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions – and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic when the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely because of formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly – and that’s what we lack in my opinion.
On the streets there is a small amount of ice, but they are mostly dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there is some snow and ice plain.
However, mostly the roads are well managed, sometimes caution is required.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets were well navigable this morning, and there was some snow and ice plain.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 ° C, during the day it should be a little warmer.
There is no snow in the region now, and only a thin snow cover remains in the lower altitudes.
However, there is about 30 cm of snow on the pebbles of the mountains.
According to the police, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The highway R6 and the first-class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is paid, for example, to bridges, on which the highways are sometimes icy and smooth.
All second and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, there are sections of frozen or exhausted snow remains.
Particularly in the higher levels, there is a need for increased attention.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of Eastern Bohemia there is danger due to ice level, in higher levels and in the mountains there is sometimes still a sloping layer of snow on the streets, the road and motorway directorate reports on its websites.
The road masters warn drivers of ice melting, which can occur especially in higher levels in the district of Pardubice.
It can occur on second and third-class roads in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is on the streets of the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Hory Mountains.
A high-rise layer of snow lies on the streets of the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia today it is predominantly sunny or cheerful, and it remains largely rain free.
Temperatures range between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
District of Pilsen
The streets in the district of Pilsen are well managed today, but local attention is required, and the way of driving is adapted to the weather.
This is frozen in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it snowed before and the temperatures subsequently dropped, it can lead to ice melting on the streets.
Locally it is also expected to be cloudy, but visibility will improve during the day.
This information comes from the district streets.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but the street masters recommend increased attention between the 80th and the 131st kilometer.
The highways of the first class are predominantly dry, but frozen.
However, in the south of the Pilsen and Tachov circles, there can be periodic glaciation.
The tracks of the second and third class are wet, and therefore the indication of possible icy sections also applies here.
Drivers should be especially careful, especially on the less frequented roads in the Bohmerwald area.
District of Olomouc
Today drivers who are driving in the direction of the altitudes in the district of Olomouc have to count on snowfall.
After the use of dispersed vehicles, snow remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night snows forced the street championships to use, in the district of Šumperk, according to the road administration, about 3 cm of new snow fell.
In the rest of the district, the highways are mostly unlimited.
“In the district of Šumperk, snow remains in the altitudes.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, drivers in the direction of Jeseník must expect a snowmash,” an employee of the road administration Šumperk told ČTK today.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to go out at night, according to her, the streets up to the altitudes are empty and wet after chemical treatment.
In the district of Olomouc, the roads are fully accessible, but in the district of Šternberk, drivers must be careful in forest cuts because the tracks are still wet.
District of Ústí nad Labem, Liberec District
In North Bohemia, the street masters report several poorly managed sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the district of Ústí n.K. is closed, according to the traffic police.
Temperatures also remain below zero at lower levels, so snow and ice will remain on the streets. From the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, no problems have been, and the streets are usually dry.
No traffic disturbances have been so far.
Iceberg is from the area of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - rain and melting snow during the day, cloudless sky and frost at night.
The main roads and the road I/13 on the border of the districts of Ústí n.L. and Liberec report poor traffic conditions.
The blocking of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches pressed from the snowload to the track.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster messages that we humans like to jump to.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce our readers to the project?
This is a national welfare event that we have been planning for two years.
To do this, we want to leverage the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, which is predicted to end on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be about the time at which the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
From whom came this idea?
Initially probably by me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think with the public about the state in which we will give this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keystrokes against the end of the world, with which the purchase of www.e-tap.cz can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other artists, also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world titled "The end of the world falls out".
Already today, the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it also sound at the beneficence concerts?
Of course, and for the very end, provided that everything goes well and the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem is to be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems together are broadcast live on Czech television.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you get to cooperate with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we conduct many charity events and concerts.
We strive to engage these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the accessible educational center Studeo, where we have been working for six years together with the Tap Association at the Jedlička Institute.
Students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, we will build our own building, into which we will then move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
According to what criteria did you choose them?
We wanted to create a program that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar “big events” planned for the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally – if we are in the United States – would also like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your overseas plans are not small, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchairs, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage compartment.
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I have sometimes been partially surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travels abroad you have a comparison of how it looks in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with people with disabilities there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than in Russia, we witnessed that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not handicapped.It is still unusual for someone to travel in a wheelchair alone in the city center.
It is not even obvious that a wheelchair driver is presented, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect do we need to get up against the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things behind us...
However, it should be noted that the improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the parties concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to museums, use toilets, etc.
It is not uncommon for a larger group of people with disabilities to actively participate in social events, but we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of strong-willed personalities.
But if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a caregiver at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in engaging in something intensely.
And since I am a musician and I play saxophone, I have founded a music company together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, used to say, something is out of control (laughs).
The band has only been known in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that collaboration with well-known singers has helped us; in addition, we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that when one does something and this is not visible to the outside, one’s own performance in a sense does not exist.
Thanks to EU grants, we can afford good lecturers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that things could be approached differently.
In the show business today, they often copy each other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is considered with caution and is only accepted after a long time.
There are few really unique things, and I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression the viewer usually has is of course pity; that is only natural.
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop if they have the necessary resources to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities something, it is a progress not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you should not compromise on many things and also require some discipline.
In my opinion, this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find out that they have trials twice a week, have to go through preparatory stages, and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm in many quickly fades out.
But this is how it works everywhere, in any band that works seriously and wants to something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them have been involved since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
There is only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome.
Happened on the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 21:00
Incheba Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
At the end, all three venues will be connected via a live circuit and a joint interpretation of the anthem “The End of the World Falls Out” by the band The Tap Tap will sound.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the facilitation of a multifunctional educational center for disabled people, which will be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
Entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency (ESA) at a ministerial meeting, making it the second member of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which joined the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s journey into space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish space enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, but they did not always find understanding.
I recall here, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entry into cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, funded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major advocate of astronomy and spaceflight.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky’s world-renowned contribution to the development of space was honored by naming one of the craters on the Earth-facing side of the moon after him.
Already in 1925 a railway drain was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remain unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or to brake the drain.
The information about this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began dealing with missile-powered missiles.
The research was conducted by the Institut Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents handed over, it is clear that the research has advanced to the stage of practical testing.
The research was then, of course, interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the draft of a photoelectric fighter rocket originating from Ing. Rohoziński appeared in the professional press, and the following year appeared the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the missile propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity its work was stopped by the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this company is in the November issue of the journal Problemy in 1954, in which four extensive articles are devoted to spaceflight.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was expected that space exploration would have a future.
As early as its inception in 1956, the Polish space company PTA sought to join the International Space Federation, which was founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member in the fall of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy chairman of the International Federation of Space.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has participated significantly in the development of the extremely successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flying height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 flight tests with the two-stage rocket RM-2 began in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a height of up to 14.5 km and be used for observing high winds.
In 1962, however, further development was stopped.
The successor to the first RM-type missile was the Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
From this rocket, three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight height was 37 km for all three types.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a load of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Poland joined the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, followed by the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimir Remek.
The abolition of the law on charitable work is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on charitable work.
This decision sparked a lively debate in the public.
It is interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with ruthless financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labor (wages), price tensions arise.
This term is to be understood as a condition in which the manufacturer attempts to survive in economic competition by importing cheap goods by "under-selling" the competition in order to seize a larger market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production overseas or buy it cheaply, or give up their business.The result is high unemployment in countries with comparably high labor costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government spending is necessarily increasing.
This situation is aggravated by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely reluctant to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused to society as a whole.
This situation is widely known, so concrete statistics at this point are superfluous.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates in the individual economies a situation in which governments are forced to compete with one another in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thereby attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments supply their own people to private capital, regardless of social consequences.
This is reflected in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and, on the other hand, by the circumcision of workers’ rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as growing gaps between rich and poor.
In Germany, for several years, there have been public food outlets for the poor who are no longer able to feed themselves by their own work.
The number of those affected has already reached millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive salaries so low that the state has to raise their income to the subsistence minimum.
A similar scandal was also revealed in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures in virtually all the southern states of the EU will undoubtedly result in the same state where people, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level, are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to mourn for a hunger wage on the margins of society, hoping that someday private investment capital will flow into the country.
This naturally raises the question, where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty moves from one country to another; or the capital remains completely out, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa in general, the workers work for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to all Latin America.
Liberal theories and media argue to the exaggeration that the state cannot participate with capital in its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital firmly insists on its position that the state must not interfere in the economy.
But then we must ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
Proof of this is the existence of a practically omnipotent lobby that is ubiquitous in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual favor, a legislation in which virtually everything is hard, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a state ministry, due to a lack of funds, entrusts private law firms, closely linked with the industry, with the preparation of draft laws.
The bill will then be passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer comes from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prevail over their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are now rapidly falling into a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at Caesar and Pompey's time: "The state has long been in disintegration, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribery, through unlawful equalization of benefits, or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew unhindered, and the people went to the election with already purchased votes... “People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state, as a result of this decline, had no consul for eight months” ... “There was already a real talk that the only medicine in this difficult situation was monarchy, and that a strong man had to be elected”... Appian thought of Pompey, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with monarchy.
As it turns out, today’s society, as in antiquity, is based on the ruthless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is by its very nature incapable of recognizing and enforcing the benefit for society as a whole.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, which do not strive at all for deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Given the current state of affairs, the collapse of these regimes in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a break in which the next round is already taking place.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today’s elites face the potential future losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters of which we are already witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The abolition of the law on non-profit works is not a solution here, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the participation of the state capital in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"... that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be no one," said the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have been, as always, countless reactions.
Some support Israel and argue with its right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians terrorists; others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel a terrorist.
I do not want to write here about who is guilty and who is victim in these ever-recurring waves of killing; in the end, the current inhabitants of Israel, including the autonomous regions, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the onset of violence themselves.
It’s about giving readers a look behind the scenes, a look at who the 95 years of tension (from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small land of the Middle East are especially useful to.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and come from my own understanding of who or which group of people has a decisive influence on the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In any epoch, we can make up an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must acknowledge that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power did not arise within the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands one that could be called the head of the Kraken (I don’t know if anyone else stands above them, but I don’t rule it out) – the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
of understandable.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds in the 1990s to prevent the association of their name with highly criminal acts, behind which was always the consolidation of their power, the multiplication of their wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are waging wars or equipping themselves for them (before the assault on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the assault on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, with Russia in the meantime subordinating its central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own (say: state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was murdered in 1963; MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
The Rothschilds’ global lust for power led, between 1859 and 1871, to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Mason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of consciousness.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist state-states of Europe, the second war was to break the colonial rule of Britain in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their conveniences and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is here nothing more than the forefront) and finally lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of richest families with the Rothschilds at the forefront works is to trigger a crisis and subsequently offer a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong and always lead to worsening the situation (see the establishment of the FED so that crises such as those they triggered in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
Having succeeded in triggering the First World War through the murder of the Habsburg throne successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian tsarist empire through the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Tsar Empire the war was no longer necessary), followed by the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the bankers, through politics, created a latent conflict situation by inflicting on Germany gigantic war reparations; thus, they created the prerequisite for impoverished masses, so that they only had to praise the Germans for a strong enough leader, who offered the guilty names and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-national state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which would take on the function of a fifth column and also took on to ignite the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as far as possible on the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the settling Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke off the chain at which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, it is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become victims in the front line, like in World War II, this time along with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (think just how sharply the people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, beginning with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
A distinction must be made here between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, only choose their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist-sensitive, loyal to international bankers politician who is doing everything possible to spark a war with Iran, which, given Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could rapidly expand into a global conflict, and in which Iran’s control of the only two-mile-wide Strait of Hormuz, which runs over 20% of the world’s oil supplies, could destroy the world economy.
In 1994, David Rockefeller said, “The only thing we need is a global crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
The New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newborn is implanted with a chip at birth to submit this being to total control.
“And it causes the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servant, all to put a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Whoever has understanding should consider the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo: When it’s worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, which had held the patronage over his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the U.S. government - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to free hostages only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carters’ defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy employees managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications at the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring refugees from Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to hide their true identity – they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff allegedly attending the country’s filming for a science fiction film.
Combination of Genres
The plan developed by the expert on “exfiltration,” Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood’s collaboration.
In order for the embellishment to become credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialized journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have long been kept secret.The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Hussar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels change in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and even in the filming of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood that come ironically and slightly overwhelmed therefore.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions – men in costumes at the meeting table, on the hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable start to his career with this film.
From a smiling actor he has become a respectable director, and even as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime No Child's Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller City Without Mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film that doesn’t take place in the director’s home Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that removed the previous films of this director from the standard of Hollywood.
However, Affleck also demonstrates this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets, showing the reconstruction of events that really took place - the entry sequence of the messaging storm is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveying the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team have achieved a similar effect on fictional scenes (the wrong film staple on a Tehran basar).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the filmic sense.
With the few, however, he works quite successfully, sometimes following the reality - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is avoided by a phone call in America, or even the pursuit hunt on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide scattering due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and so they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses some traction.It is a film that you can follow with some interest while enjoying the design and the retro style that reminds you of a thriller from the 1970s.
However, enthusiasm is difficult to arouse.
However, it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive to this day and as a proof of how overwhelming the notions of the omnipotent and all-knowing intelligence services are.
Guidelines for inflating airballs, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually calls out a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to host the competition "Absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
“This idea was brought to us by the plan recently presented by the EU to introduce a 40% share of women in the management of large European companies,” Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organizing this survey, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women had an advantage with life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
“Other incredible inventions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then be held until the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations are the mandatory mixing of bioethanol in fuels, which is consequently harmful to nature, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has made eggs much more expensive this year.
Criticism has also reaped in the past the actual prohibition of the use of the term "butter smear" or even the ban on the sale of conventional bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long.
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of one or another lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks even with the threat of veto).
Lobby interests also stood behind the requirement that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have "curvature anomalies".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it merely harmonizes the disparate national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruits and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries, noting that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for the winner in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to airballs, must be marked when sold that children under eight years of age are not allowed to blow up the airball without the supervision of an adult.
According to a U.S. study, balloons are the leading cause of child suffocation deaths.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using year-to-year trolley.
There are curious incidents at home.
Relatively absurd is also a directive that affects the European officials themselves – anyone who occupies an official position in the EU may not use the term Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the subject to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, has also nominated the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies on the territory of a member country.
The EU has thus set the maximum amount of food supplies that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then, for example, exceeded the fixed volume for mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving grants for applications for grants.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by not having a sea.
We will apply for reimbursement from the EU,” said Jaroslav Palas, the then Minister of Agriculture of the Czech Republic.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest was very high and the state warehouses were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another route to sea ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic so far as to organize a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for subsidy applications were offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the leadership of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), in particular the funds for submitting subsidy applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations can easily become the target of criticism in the Member States, the EU’s efforts to regulate and thus to improve the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve more recognition, according to some experts.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is the EU funding for projects that have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced in the budget negotiations by individual Member States.
Emotions also highlights the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels, must fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and does not always win this struggle.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, our manufacturers had to rename the inland room (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century.
The term rum may only be used for products made from sugarcane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or the Parmaschinkens now include the Karlsbad Zwieback, the Karpfe from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saaz Hopfen.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or the Hořicer Rollen can be brewed.
“People want me to save the republic, but I’m just an amateur,” said Okamura.
How did you come up with the idea of running for the presidency?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I’t be running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the republic be looted for 20 years, thieves run around freely, while people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But if I see something that I don’t like, then I try to suggest a solution to change that.
And since I’m over 40, and I’m independent and unpartial, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
You succeeded in the Senate and then immediately set out on your way to the castle.
Don’t you turn your back on your voters?
I told myself all the time that I would start the fight for the castle after the results of the Senate elections.
I later clarified this and said that I would run for the presidency if I were elected to the Senate.
My goal is not function, but function is a tool for me to realize my vision.
I need as much influence and as much mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as a people, in the pubs and in front of the television, but that we crush anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media that want to steal one’s honor, and that confuse freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
For example, I was claimed to be bribery of journalists or to be a consultant of Jiří Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
You started the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retroactive asset declarations of over 20 million crowns.
For this, you have to change the laws.
As president, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As an ordinary citizen, I was committed to ensuring that the tour guide remained a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-minded politics – when someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent party member, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country from any party without box-box thinking and party dogma.
Do you see yourself as a politician on the right or on the left?
From a Czech perspective, it seems to me that people look more to the left.
For me, this right-left thinking is completely irrelevant.
It is important for me that we continue.
It’s not about whether someone belongs to the left or right; I want to connect people.
I will always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You hate when someone calls you a populist.
But don’t you confirm this by what you just said?
When you make a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
This is what you want to approach.
This can be called populism for my sake, but all the proposals I have talked about already work in the world, or they have been discussed by key experts.
But without the support of the parliament, they are left with only keywords.
In the long run, they are not going far in politics.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will be able to enforce, for example, material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
To persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to enforce these goals.
As president, it would be no problem for me to call on the heads of parliamentary parties live on television to legalise the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the respondents should then explain why they reject it.
A strong personality that points to misconduct can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my program.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn’t work, I’ll go back to the private sector in six years.
It sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know I can’t anything by myself, so I’ve talked to several famous personalities about whether they want to run for the Senate too.
I spoke with Radim Jančura, for example, but he refused because of overwork.
I also supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the fraud in the trade in light heating oil.
I started my candidacy with the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I’m not sure.
Sixty percent of eligible voters did not go to the elections at all, and those who went mostly voted for representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent members.
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example, for the direct election of mayors and district heads.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the past of every potential party member, and I don’t have the money at all.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign; I have only 20,000 CZK on my transparent account.
You have no money?
You are talking about asset statements, what are yours?
My personal assets are estimated at about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a plot worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about one million.
The Aston Martin, by the way, was a childhood dream - I always liked James Bond driving in the car, being galant to women and at the same time fighting evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and don’t have money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
This is not exactly convincing.
I don’t have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make debts?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t arouse too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign with my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn’t live on the senator’s salary alone; I couldn’t, for example, fund my son’s English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I would not run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn’t you say you’re going to retreat those activities?
This is not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I partially retreated from my activities.
For example, my deputy will be the director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live from something.
What monthly income were you accustomed to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As president, however, I would completely shut down my.

The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not just in the head - on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently erected Bücherberg - 2 photos
“I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the side of the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large company, says: “But, it’s pretty, the house.”
But I wonder why we need a library today.
Everyone has internet, iPad and e-books.
No one volunteers to any of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a hardly-needed sleeping town outside the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000 population community has the lowest education rate in the whole Netherlands.
To counteract this stupid circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to replicate the seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro banknotes as beautifully sculpted steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of stunning bar diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical constructions, took the matter with the usual serenity and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile in the face.
And while the jury was still staring around and shaking with the axles, the cowardly Maas stacked his chosen contribution of the magnitude to a pyramid and ended his actionist-backed speech with the words: "Dear Town Hall!"
This is my proposal for the Bookberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the $30 million mountain is scattered.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project was also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the face-free small town retreat, which so far had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and an overwhelmingly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, is richer to a piece of contemporary architecture.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression: Book Eldorado under cheese clock.
Although there is an elevator that leads through the mountain massive, the true pleasures of space and reading unfold when the topography climbs on foot.
The round-glassed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lanterns speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
We are already looking for boys and girls playing soccer, dogs and soccer.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally, the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle there is a large, dark room that is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We put the classic room configuration on our heads and shaped the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the Bookerberg is skillfully used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology center.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall clothing, sometimes armor, sometimes ladder.
Optics, haptics and smells are foreign.
Even embroiled architects and construction engineers shake their heads about the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so one day we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Friesland farm.
For many years in the Netherlands, millimetre thin plastic floss has been used as a root base in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons, after which it is ripe for sealing waste.
For the library, the vlies - for the first time in these quantities - were pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) discolors into a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a bit like new cars and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps, we reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-meter hike, you will be rewarded at the literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and dotted ficus trees.
They ensure the atmosphere, but above all the proper humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a landmark project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass fall, the sun only shines inside for a short time, even on sunny days.
The wide wooden clamps, which stand across to the glass facade, serve as shadows and capture much of the sunlight.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automated rollers.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, was already entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who describes the Boekenberg as the Spijkenisses "long overdue soul".
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
This is to fill for the time being the optical gaps in the library that is not yet fully equipped - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has come up.
The shelves are still filled.
“Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
If it is only for the decoration.
Thus, MVRDV has achieved that royal discipline, which is called in the jargon identity foundation.
Spijkenisse wrote literary history.
No matter how young and uneducated you may be.
This is finally a point of identity.
Szabo: “Germans need to play a bigger role”
Germany abstained from voting on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin balances on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
Then Berlin stopped.
Why Why ?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Germany has to be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
It was eventually implemented by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
This is because it is just turning its foreign policy away from a policy that was so to speak managed by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
The worst thing is that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still working on their role, but they are on the way to a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as that of France or the United Kingdom.
What does a “normal” foreign policy really mean from a German perspective?
It demonstrates the willingness to take positions that are independent of those of the US or European partners in the case of national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests differ to a certain extent from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to stumble the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
This definitely plays a role.
But I don’t want to put too much weight on it, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from voting on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That’s why I don’t think this was such a dramatic breakthrough as in the Libyan issue.
Germany may even have some respect for it.
Because it signals that as an international player, he must be taken seriously and his interests must be considered.
There are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States has clearly vetoed.
Are there differences between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think the Obama administration secretly has a lot of understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government can of course not represent this position publicly.
I think the real differences are not as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and on the position of the key partners in the EU on the other?
That is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can’t be part of a wider line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
This is what you are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will take on a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player – does Germany want to take on a leading role?
Does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is not used to it yet, which is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany takes on a larger role, various anti-German feelings are released.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be receptive to various neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the United States in European politics is continuously decreasing, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment, who else remains there?
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don’t like it, it’s uncomfortable for them and makes them even more unpopular – c’est la vie!

"Trademark protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, as is Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this hides a name officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the original companies.
Nevertheless, they enjoy protection as long as the actual names do not complain.
Even then, it is not clear if they are right.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a law firm that specializes in copyright infringements in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters to enable them to register their brands.
So, Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you are allowed to enter Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries from the Brand Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company protected the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey shops that almost exclusively sell counterfeits.
But Pattloch’s case is different: on behalf of his clients, he is opposed to the fact that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it “Bang Mingpai”, a passenger brand.
The word is derived from “Bang Dakuan”.
This means women who are fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not guilty.
"This is harmful to business, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
“The brand is drained, the exclusion disappears, the imagery damage is enormous.”
The financial failures and process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive model products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing with a volume of €15 billion a year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to and go into money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court rejected lawsuits because after the long duration of the contested name has become a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist money for breaking his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently acquired the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
For this reason, the Chinese can still use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not guilty.
The brand office CTMO in Beijing has admitted that there were congestion in 2010 due to too little personnel and space.
Last year, however, it was "returned from the emergency situation in the workflow to normality".
The number of unresolved complaints decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than last year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending in the office.
Dealing with it costs a lot.
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China ranks the list of new notifications worldwide.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, totaling 5.5 million units.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were collected.
Simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To deal with this is costly many times, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
However, the Germans were able to that its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts was exhausted.
However, the imitator continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We have missed this because in Germany family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO also rejected the Munich opposition.
Freudenberg was right in the next two instances, but the opponent of the trial continues to fight to this day.
You have to be careful
The case is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “The procedure is extremely demanding and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, and the company’s archives even had to look through hundreds of years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg in vain offered the other party a “high six-digit euro amount” for settlement.
“It shows how much it is worth,” says Wentzler.
The danger in the Far East threatens to return to Europe.
Then, namely, when imitators secure unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has long since been abandoned by the group, but it was able to reject the registration.
“You have to be careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advised German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but foreigners should “register everything that is somehow worthy of protection in China,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his brand drama, then one would probably have to pay the other party license fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir tries Imbongi – and in Swaziland, Aids beasts rejoice about it.
The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slipper look for the pace on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One two three four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - upset, enchant and persecute each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his cloth shoes when he brings them together with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi tries a new song.
The fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, came from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, which is estimated by UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 people living in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS foes in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found Paten in Germany.
Seventy of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a patentage.
She guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a warm meal every day at the Gogo Center.
In Zulu, Imbongi means storyteller or praise.
The Bantus language fluently no one can speak in this room but sing.
For a decade, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally bringing them back to where they originated: in the South of Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometers of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
40% are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are exposed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, the little shows what Swaziland is ill with: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male forehead, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, dying in the middle of thirty is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school you have no chance in a poor country.
In the beginning, it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him a warm meal a day.
However, a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and trippers (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs include HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Filter lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main concerned groups?
Syphilis and trippers occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five cases of syphilis in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungus), tripper and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low – however: about 20 percent of new HIV infections fall into this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among adolescents than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, human papillomavirus is also common among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011 there were approximately 2700 cases.
That is about a tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
However, often they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Because in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STIs can be cured and late consequences can be avoided.
Through patches, donations and not least the gags that the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the club.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and powerful woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated with one of the grandmothers, for example.
The Gogos, as the old women in Zulu are called, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans with them, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear to school every day on time.
Whoever has no one else comes to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as much as the two chefs who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, “Voices for Africa” has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses and joined the American health organization PSI to organize that many in the village have to have a HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because no matter how obvious the disease is throughout the country, one prefers to keep it silent.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In fact, strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There would be free condoms everywhere, says Annette Lennartz, “but they are hardly used.
Culture is different – flesh to flesh.”
To promote cultural exchanges, the Imbongi Choir travels together through South Africa every two or three years, singing songs full of hardship, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from apartheid times.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language – so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already wiped away a few tears from some fierce border guards.
The trip always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their grandchildren.
Although you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
“Go to Esitjeni, there is the light,” the people there say.
And when you return to Heidelberg on the 8733 km airline, to the stomping singers in the trial room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shining there too.
NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice ceiling may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published in the journal Science on Thursday.
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently shaded region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that struck Mercury.
“Nobody connects the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet,” said Messenger’s chief scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small hole in infinite vastness.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits around the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This image from the Spitzer Telescope’s infrared image shows a “family portrait” of countless star generations: the oldest stars are recognizable as blue dots, the more difficult to identify are the pink “newborns” in the orbit.
This star-forming region – unromantically called W5 by scientists – has been discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This shining glow of a dying star has been captured by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star cast out during the death process.
In the giant Trifid nebula, 5400 light-years away from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope captured this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Pleasant star cluster, also known as the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix nebula in this infrared photo looks towards the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent gave this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photography ensures the spectacular coloring.
This baby star in its full beauty could only be captured by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they formed is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images taken by the Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (triple, triple), as dark stripes of dust triple the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the Serpent Carrier constellation, astronomers have photographed the forerunners of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are colliding and inevitably colliding.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
For those who do not have technical abbreviations, they may be called Southern Fire Wheel by their nickname.
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a section of the iris nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1,400 light-years-away nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was combined from optical and X-ray images from different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, captured the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The Starweight always produces new youngsters.
Also, these star clouds, connected to the Rosette Nebula, are constantly producing new baby stars – 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
Scientists suspect it did not form shortly after the Big Bang, when most of the hydrogen was found in the universe.
Our Insights into Space: The Major Telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey – even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have grown larger and deeper – and the insights they provide are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is enormous – the mirror alone reaches 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the advantageous construction: The telescope is stuck in its height angle - and therefore limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed at the height.
Its speciality: the high light collection power.
Despite its relatively small diameter, it is comparable to the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to the space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the “Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence” (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the European Observatory Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which honors its name.
With its total of four mirrors, the remote tube can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror is meant to cover a total of 42 meters - and will be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
Images are expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them still looks into the sky with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already delivered images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets – mostly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 planet candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
In the image are documented the last launch preparations on the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched in early 2018 on board an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope’s tasks is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe there is ice on the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the messenger orbits the planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have suggested for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
With the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to orbit Mercury - scientists now have certainty.
Drinking Butter Every Day to Age 168 Years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in a country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in a country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysch mountains is wildly romantic.
The bus rolls across the curved road, passing by dense forested hills, ripping rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
However, this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talys, of which not much is known, except that they speak perfectly Persian as well as Azeri and are very long-lasting.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town is full of Soviet-era architecture that doesn’t want to fit in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the arrival from Azerbaijan’s capital Baku is too difficult.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one-track.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff to be a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we have a festival of the world's oldest people here," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum for Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talys from the area documented, which is older than 100.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child was born.
But the controversial star of the museum is Shepherd Şirali Muslimov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented person, who turned 122 years old, Muslimov’s age seems extremely questionable.
"In 1805, he was born here in the region, in 1973, he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man is said to have been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he is said to have given birth to another daughter.
So has Şirali Muslimov counted for a few decades at his age?
But Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the high age in Central Asia.
“There are also strikingly many elderly people in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia there are extremely many very elderly men.”
However, due to the lack of documents, there was no scientific proof of the age, especially because of the lack of personal status registers.
Fused butter every day
But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik strikingly often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years old.
Why are there so many people living in the south?
The Azerbaijani travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is about nutrition.
But that it is precisely the high-calorie diet of the Talys that is so healthy, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, from a nutritional point of view also does not seem exactly plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young?Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that rolls her down and down tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayev's sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two kids are also jumping around.
In the kitchen, the guests are prepared tea, served in the typical armadu glasses.
Mirzayev’s white teeth stand perfectly in rows and limbs, under her scarf she hides long, dark-blonde beads, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out of me and retained their color.
"I also never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven’t bought food in the supermarket a single time in my life.
Then she talks about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the post-World War II period.
But everything got better when the “beloved father” Heydar Aliyew took over.
It sounds strange from an old woman’s mouth.
But the cult driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003 and later his son Ilham took over.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan’s elderly.
230 manats (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount from which one can live well.
And Mirzayev’s long-grained son is also right: “The elderly enjoy respect in our culture.”
They live in the midst of a large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human rights” is missing in the Constitution.
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as the basis is heavily controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he told state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims and secularists.
Because all of them, so far hopelessly dispersed in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Morsi said he temporarily cut down the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers “to save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, about which the Egyptians are concerned, the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be dismissed?
In fact, the 234 articles scratched by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a nightly, 15-hour perfumery are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What do you mean by “principles”?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and there is concern that Islamists will use the spongy wording and the associated legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This suggests at least one newly added article: In all matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution, must be drawn to the attention of the entire Sunni Islam.
That doesn’t have to be the case, but it may mean that the clergy oversee legislation, which de facto would result in the dismantling of the judiciary.
Much of the Constitution is a matter of interpretation.
Also problematic: the civil military jurisdiction should continue to beined.
These courts served to suppress opposition during Mubarak’s reign.
After the overthrow of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military detention.
The draft also states that the state should “protect the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morality and values”.
This is legally formulated so vague that state institutions could even control the contents of film art and literature using this article.
This means nothing more than censorship.
There is no article explicitly stating the equality of men and women.
For this, another prohibits insulting or defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Equally dubious is the wording that “insulting people” is prohibited.
Is it enough a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
A matter of interpretation, like so much in the draft, which Mursi is present for signature and according to his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
“The revolution has returned.”
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the supremacy of Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual unity on Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday evening and vowed to overthrow the charter before it could come into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution belongs "to the rubbish mountain of history".
He accused Morsi’s supporters of trying to conduct a “coup against democracy.”
“If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not been redeemed yet," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, blown to the counter-demonstration, but cautiously not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of the University of Cairo.
Many disguised women and Salafists took part in it, shouting, “The people are demanding the application of God’s law.”
They demanded from Mursi, “Pure the land!” and said, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have provoked civil war-like conditions.
Morsi’s supporters obviously didn’t want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken out loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide on the ballot which direction the country should go.
A majority in favour of the Islamist draft is considered safe.
“The word human rights doesn’t even appear.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process, which should have lasted until February and involved all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in jail or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, jailed.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in a conversation with "World on Sunday".
Mursi's extension of power to all three powers in the state caused the lawyer to resign.
These measures are flagrant violations of democratic rules of play and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto destroys it," Saeda complains.
Without civil society, democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels lonely, even by the international community, who sees the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could get revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warned: “You have a monster that you can’t control anymore.”
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the worst fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - and not only in Europe, but around the world.
Could the secret to the country’s success have something to do with the local appetite for pretty odorious fish?
A selection of overweight cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a bunch of dirty, wet sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
So you have to imagine the nasopharyngeal smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and that stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salt-sprayed forel, which - depending on how stinking you would like your fish - fermented in water for up to a year.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather becomes colder, Norwegians rush to a feast here in Fagernes, dedicated to this, well, really very exciting speciality.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but as the so-called "Rakfisk-General" also hosts the festival.
People around us eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"People like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," says Havard.
Spirits can remove the smell.
I cost a few pieces.
Avoiding bringing the rakfisk close to the nose is not bad – like sushi, which has a fairly long bus ride behind.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no refrigeration options and fish were soaked in airproof saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then taken out after a long fermentation and - undoubtedly under the aid of alcohol-dampened senses - consumed.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and comprehensive healthcare.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which was far richer than Norway not too long ago, immigrants are flowing.
Rakfisk is seen as something important – an essential, though strictly odoring part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But in fact, everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t often get into the world press, and most people don’t seem to bother it.
Here, people still hate to name Anders Breivik – the racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it only refers to the “July 22 incident.”
Norwegians are struggling to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main reason for Norway’s current wealth has been the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets of ripe rackfish and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and spotting blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a prudent people.
His English is just like most people here.
We are not very complacent, we do not like boasting.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully – a large part of the industry’s revenue is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years before the global economic crisis, everyone threw around with money that they did not possess at all, Norway kept its wallet tightly locked.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
“And of course, eat rakfisk,” she adds with a laughless laugh.
I’m standing in the snow and preparing for a different dish – I’ve had enough of Rakfisk.
Such an elch burger is definitely something different.The juicy meat mouths me.
But in the evening, the stink fish is on the meal plan again.
The hotel I’m staying in is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best – or the most challenging – fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-dressed showmaster surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
“What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?”
“Here are our points, Havard.”
You cuddle and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by aquavit.
But maybe it is the strict dust of the whole fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start.
As Mexico’s future president, Enrique Pena Nieto, prepares to take office, Will Grant from the BBC analyzes the challenges he faces and the mixed feelings of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is bad.
Even on better days, this is an ever-stocked city, but on Monday, a steel ring was erected, blocking several major transport routes into the capital and causing chaos on the streets.
The goal, however, was not to disturb people on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential bonds and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under Felipe Calderon’s departing government, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My administration is strongly committed to reducing violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will help us this goal.
Prior to becoming president of the United States, Pena Nieto served as governor of his native state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
The residents of the resort attribute to it the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can ride on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built, which is a great improvement compared to the brittle, holistic streets that once existed here.
Plakets with his name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the party Pena Nietos, the PRI.
Specifically in terms of security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
The opposition’s accusations that the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He is a great politician, but above all, he is someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway transfers and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was deployed to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a acute problem.
On a spot in Brachland near a large garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind in the last two years alone.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico – a statistic that even surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and murders of innocent women.
The critics of Pena Nietos believe that he has not addressed the problem of women’s murders adequately during his tenure.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building typical of the downed neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body sticker had already been applied.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is attached next to a cross that carries a single word: justice.
But this, such as the family, has been denied to her so far.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a snooker, a disturber, a nörglerin.
They just want to accept their judgment and keep their mouth shut.
“But that’s not possible when there were so many forms and omissions,” she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bond on Saturday, he also takes on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have suffered from violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has pledged to take special care of this problem during his tenure.
"I hope as president he is as he was as a governor," says PRI congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Prosecutor says Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
Prosecutors reject Bradley Manning’s allegations that he was abused in prison
The hearing examines Mannings time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks rejection of the accusation due to harsh conditions of detention
U.S. Army Released Accused of Stolen Thousands of Confidential Documents
The prosecutor's office tried on Friday to establish that Army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history - failed several occasions to complain about the alleged abuse he suffered in military detention.
At a cross-interrogation of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Mayor Ashden Fein explained that documents of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning’s nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the interrogation, which was held as a result of a defence request to reject the accusation - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh period of detention - Manning had stated that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In Friday’s hearing, Fein and Manning reviewed the forms that officials had filled out after meeting with Manning during his detention at Quantico military prison, where he served under heightened conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein interviewed him on the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the facility as "very professional" overall.
The forms, Fein said, did not contain complaints about abuse, although officials had questioned Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated to deal with them.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns) 'No problems' and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to examine the suicide thoughts he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observation status to “prevent injury.”
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is one level below the risk of suicide - to protect him and others.
"I wanted to convince staff that I was doing well and get rid of the observation status for injury prevention (...) in order to a higher quality of life in my view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was detained for two months before being transferred to the Quantico Naval Base prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said in Kuwait he considered suicide and once lost consciousness due to the heat.
Not being able to know what was happening to him or to the outside world was stressful.
"My world shrunk on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
When he was relocated to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or just lie down.
He always had to sleep with light coming from the outside into his cell.
When he turned around at night and the guards could no longer see his face, they woke him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning’s lawyer formally objected to Manning’s treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge also questioned Manning on an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday — that he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners during a morning count.
Manning had stated that during this count he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket.
At the interrogation on Friday, Manning said he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket he could have covered himself with.
On Thursday, Manning said he had been forced to sleep naked the night before and had previously tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the bundle of his underwear or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will take into account at least his detention experience and will reduce his detention rate drastically if he is convicted at his military trial.
The defense has stated that Manning will confess guilty of minor offenses, while other charges that are considered too extreme will be challenged.
The hearing is scheduled to continue this weekend and the prosecutor’s office is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the regulations that apply to all prisoners held under the highest security measures in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include favouring the enemy, illegally publishing intelligence information on the Internet, transferring national defense information, and stealing public property or documents.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he risks life imprisonment.
The Mexican American Identity Crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the expatriates - they remind them of difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed through the hall and had arrived at the passport check when confusion spread in me.
Signs refer to two rows: one for “Mexicanos” (“Mexicans”), the other for “Extranjeros” (“Estrangers”).
I stood there for a few seconds, not sure which to go to.
I grew up in Central California and was called “Mexican” all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation – just as my friends in Boston call themselves “Irish,” or my friends in New York “Italians.”
Later, I chose “Mexican American.”
This was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home there was no need for cuts or bandages.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in that language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I don’t get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the line for aliens.
I thought about the moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are equally likely to stay in Mexico nowadays instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to allied with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc following the example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even though he did not give details about this.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought on the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country’s leadership under a conspiracy to give them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official makes even the slightest criticism of Mexico, we hear — in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country — complaints about how the Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma are on the path of war.
And yet Mexico’s biggest challenge really lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers; people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our tribal tree a person — a parent or grandparent — did not get a chance offered in Mexico and migrated northward.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not in Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, have attended good schools and got good jobs, we should never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we are living – not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be vague, but when it comes to our loyalty, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their view, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they’t have left.
And then we’t see ourselves now trapped behind the silk curtain – with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are – and Mexican Americans take them badly.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel like they do not belong to one country or the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but you are not rooted in either.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of educational citizenship want to re-establish their connections with the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary “ambassadors” for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We are going to tell our American counterparts how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
and now.
This will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unfettered corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if this is really a great country.
I am afraid you will have to go through it alone, friends.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are still unwilling to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a resentment for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm .
Maybe we’re more “Mexican” than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the germ.
Amid the usual accusations, countless buildings were laid in ruins and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis were killed – and for the first time, rockets from Gaza have been hit near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of that mess.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
However, there is reason to believe that the deadly situation could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, optimism in view of the current situation seems all other than appropriate.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, the fighting this week has strengthened the hard-hearted on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back, even though its group itself suffered heavy losses.
Despite several Hamas leaders being killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip being imprisoned in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders may come to the conclusion that they have the time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to attract powerful and wealthy friends to its side.
Turkey, a rejuvenating regional power that was once regarded as Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken the side for Hamas – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jovial Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist half-moon is forming around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah holds power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist shape could face the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt – by far the most populous and most important Arab country – on the southern flank of Israel has permanently changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that even Israel and the United States cannot push out.
Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw the opposite conclusion.
Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, Iron Dome, has proven itself and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep quieter.
Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the recent escalation of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide bombers – not least thanks to the blockades that run into the West Bank and thus into the main part of a potential Palestinian state.
Netanyahu’s Likud party has allied itself with an even more militant group ahead of the January 22 election under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these insidious Palestinians hate them and leave them their own state?
If they actually had control of the West Bank,’t they fire missiles just like their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
No, it’s better to keep them behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Per the hardliners will be able to prevail, but the Arab Spring could make them a slide through the bill.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense power is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments rebuild their economies.
That the pragmatic President Mursi has teamed up with Barack Obama to a ceasefire could be a promising sign – and symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think longer term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking drastic steps toward democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination – a powdered container that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded this week in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to repel Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an outward push.
The correct answer is the one represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states to which Israel covers territories for security purposes.
The – small for the near future – hope is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, halt arms deliveries to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by a territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also push Hamas and Fatah toward an agreement.
That would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming UN observer status application.
Obama must also contribute to bringing Israel to negotiations.
During his first term in office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems like he is also reluctant to participate.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and sick body parts on neutral green packages that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first unified cigarette and tobacco packaging laws have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green covers, which are also printed with dramatic images showing sick body parts and infants and children sick by cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and images, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small fonts, will be from next Saturday.
Australia has the strictest regulations for tobacco packaging in the world.
The Australian federal government wants to prevent young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
Studies have shown that people who haven’t started smoking at 26 have a 99% chance of not starting again after that.
"You can already see in young children that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a slight impact on multinational corporate profits, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law.
It said the laws would favor the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger amounts of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, notes that demand for cigarette tuis and silicon caps to cover intolerable packaging has risen enormously since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed to challenge the laws at the Australian Supreme Court two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units at wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the hake in the popularity of social media lies in the exact population targeted by the plan.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, prohibited them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most retailers to stop interpreting cigarettes in stores.
The Australian government has banned online advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Those who market tobacco and have only a small area left to promote their products don’t come around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a researcher in healthcare at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in reviews of brands written by “completely normal people.”
You have to ask yourself: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that she even makes a video for it – or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws rather than marketing.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations – those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries have major trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to require photographic warnings.
In the meantime, it has been expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harsher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are challenging.
The pictures do not affect me.
I simply ignore them.
"You just take a cube and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box with a photo of a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there’s only one reason I’d quit, and that’s my little girl.
James Yu, the operator of the "King of the Pack" tobacco store in downtown Sydney, says the unified packaging has made it difficult to replenish its shelves.
“I used to take an hour to sort a shipment, now I need four,” Yu says.
“The government should have simply completely banned cigarettes – then we’d have said okay, that’s it, we’re going to shut down,” he added.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored.
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to get a few thoughts to get bored.
I do not want to lie.
Waiting for a flight for half a day at the airport is pretty nervous—even when books, magazines, and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts refer to boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us – and our children – to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to get lost in interesting thought courses, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us are almost constantly staring at one or the other screen these days, we no longer benefit from the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
and yes.
and no .
I will return to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of “Boredom: A Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn’t think so.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The walls of Pompeii decorate a Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After long reading research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wishing to perform a satisfactory activity but not being able to do it."
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
With apathy, however, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a “disruption of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is just slowly passing.”
Boredom can sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored individuals see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re boring, even if we just have trouble concentrating.
In their study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” which appeared in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a band on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content.Others heard it at low volume so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The individuals who heard the hardly-heard television feeling more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, couldn't find a reason for this, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When trying to concentrate on a difficult or exhausting task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you practice a monotonous activity – “like looking for faulty products on a factory carrier tape – music can distract and help you not get bored.”
In fact, he says, we now know that cuddling around and cuddling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight them by staying more physically alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hang around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit down,” says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point – my delayed flight, a drilling speaker, a tired movie.
Some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a “scale of boredom susceptibility” in the 1980s.
On the scale, you can find statements such as “Many things I have to do repeat and are monotonous” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have enough time for everything.”
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida – as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a rather tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted a pager with 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of young adults were bored at school and doing homework, while 23% being bored when they weren’t at school.
However, only 3% of parents feeling bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn’t know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is confident that “youths are felt as boring,” mainly because children and teenagers do not have much influence on their day-to-day course.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads people to take extreme physical risks and fall to gambling or drugs to ease them - this has been shown by studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors are studying the relationship between boredom and creativity.This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you to do something different," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what is best to do.
When you’re bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you’ll be happy.
However, television can provide short-term feelings of happiness, but they disappear in the long run.
Those who give their bored child an iPad can help them get away from boredom, but they have not learned how to entertain or control themselves, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds, “self-control is transmitted from one situation to another.”
The child not only learns to talk, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don’t think we should celebrate boredom.
We should also not be too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable even away from constant activity and technology distractions.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often, but boredom is the tormenting, unceasing desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth people are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly over-stimulated, it's hard to get involved once the noise is silenced."
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is facing trial in southeastern Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in that state: the possession of a few marijuana pieces and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving a car in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug utensils — cavalry crimes, each punished with a $100 fine — and was given a trial date.
“We are being treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for own use, the response to hundreds of smaller drug crimes depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of violations surrounding marijuana are already being abandoned here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
Police will no longer prosecute adults over the age of 21 for small-scale possessions, which will be legally permitted as soon as the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they will continue to prosecute existing marijuana offenses and are still quoting people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, government-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“This situation is developing so quickly that I don’t even know what will happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Even regulators in the state of Washington are scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance to establish a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - with a deadline until December 1, 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado in any case is ahead of most states in regards to the regulation of marijuana.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited for guidance," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Spirits Regulatory Authority.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we can follow,” he added.
The Washington Act, called I-502, comes into force on December 6 and thus also forms the endpoint of a gray zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified during this time—such as how to agree on the state’s requirement of “adequate access” to licensed marijuana with the ban on cannabis stores within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the urban area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his employees in Aurora stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses against people over 21 and that the police “from now on” would not seek criminal charges for these offenses.
Chief Oates added that police will continue to enforce city regulations regulating medical marijuana growers and drug dealers will continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have been charged with possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
“Our authority has the duty to prosecute violations that were criminal at the time of the crime,” Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are ambiguous even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer show adults for possessing smaller amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding ownership proceedings.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile personal marijuana consumption with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions across the state sparked a deep divide among local officials regarding the big green experiment.
District prosecutors are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents defendants in court for marijuana crimes and acts on the spot as a spokesman for the national organization to reform marijuana laws.
“They’ve spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for still unable to accept legalization,” he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being treated as national model cases for legalizing drugs.
While advocates and government officials are preparing for an era of legal sale, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a crime.
Proponents of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will surrender.
Despite several alarming arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser for the Obama administration, believes that while criminal officers are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of the drugs, they are likely to strive to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana stores, although these may not open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six-month ban, which is likely to be passed next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our municipality voted against this legislative amendment.
We are guided by what the community has chosen, not by what the state has chosen.
A lot of questions remain open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only today’s university students are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university, which I once considered the greatest seat of knowledge in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization – free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of entering Worscester College in the late 1980s – where I had planned to study history – I had packed my suitcases again, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father broke up in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said I had left because I had a problem with fellow classmates having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A. N. Wilson sadly stated that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less fun.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my quite unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason—a reason that seemed so narrow-minded and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my now dead father, Woodrow Wyatt, had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate-right students is suffering from similar persecution.
The organized and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same equal protection that benefits gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College’s Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are “often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared unwanted” due to their political views.
They demand a seat in their college’s equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation has been aggravated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," depicting the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
It showed, among other things, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who was driving a Rolls-Royce and wore a silver costume and a silver-covered pedestal.
At other universities, conservative students say they are seen as “punishments for introducing higher tuition fees.”
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Conservative Student Association at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing leftist trend at universities.
“People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without ever getting to know us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, and a history student at Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, considers such a climate to be "unpleasant." 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of the Oxford Conservative Student Association, says she has seen a growing rejection of moderate-right students among JCR members.
“This poses a danger to the intellectual discourse and the well-being of the members,” she says.
In my first weeks at Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted not to award Margaret Thatcher – a former student – an honorary title due to cuts in university education.
The atmosphere would have scared even the Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of what was going to happen in the future.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the ridicule of Tory students, but even joined them with pleasure.
Political topics such as the miners’ strike, privatization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime found their way into the wooden rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I had to translate French texts from the 18th century into English.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled at it.
Pitt was a small man with a face like chicken, and quite disgusting.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students stumbled.
In my eyes were tears.
“I suggest that they take a few French lessons in your free time – so if you’re not too busy with your social activities,” Pitt nodded to me.
I went back to my room with my head hanging.
That evening I was sitting alone at college for dinner when someone slightly tapped me on my shoulder.
There was an English second-year student named James who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
Unfortunately it is as it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory is harassed.
It’s bad enough for me, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it’s going to be worse for you.
Most Tory first-semesterers pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to get distracted.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A graduate of philosophy, politics and economics who, ironically, attended Eton College, considered conservative, said to me, “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.”
You are contaminated.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
“How do Tories have sex?” one asked me.
They are fighting each other, right?
I felt what homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years ahead of me stretched out in front of my spiritual eye into a fire of rejection and isolation.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising and writing speeches for Thatcher on foreign policy matters.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small-carried, and rejected it for its Marxist-determinist historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I started pending between Oxford and my parents’ home and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said softly.
Such a thing they would never do, not in my city of dreaming tower tops.
Even my communist friends always displayed improper manners.
His damp eyes blurred.
Give the whole a chance.
I’m sure they just cheat you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also a Tory supporter, had surrendered to pressure and abandoned his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, where another historian had seriously claimed that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Though I was secretly scattered by shame, I admitted that my parents had undergone me a "brainwash" and called it "old fool."
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my hats gave up.
As they went, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a crapper.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic, it was Oxford – a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but hides itself to this day behind an unmerited reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Masters of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Masters of Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 Haute Couture dresses were assembled created by his "Maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is “il signore” Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the distant and distant world of nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be on display until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signatures of the most read aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be of disadvantage.
“At least, they don’t put their chicks out on your gorgeous carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrities.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza in a Valentino dress
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, his influence was recognized and felt.
“All guests felt important and loved,” recalls the “top model” who began her career at the 1995 Haute Couture Week in Paris.
“He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” she concludes.
Fashion of Origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, but rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60 meter long runway that suggests a role exchange: the user takes up the model’s seat and walks along the runway to admire a dreamy “audience” wearing Valentino’s masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumes Monica Vitti wore in “La Notte,” or a wool and leather coat belonging to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls shine names such as that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, “unforgettable.”
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s musees.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," added the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and fashion leader Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses.
At the end of the 1990s, this finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at my cousin’s palace, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying jacket and a draped top with a decolleté that honors his name.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino doesn’t depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg preserves her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care" "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it."
The “King” of Fashion
The great final of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "children" (as the fashion maker called his suckers) were needed to make this ivory-colored silk dress with pearls, twelve different stickers, and a four-and-a-half-foot swing.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the professional press, this dress was a milestone in the late 20th century Haute Couture, "the return to the customers of the top society."
Damaged for years with the “savoir-être” of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded with the Legion of Honour, accumulates Garavani as many honors as each of the husbands of his clients.
“I’ve always noticed its sophistication, its calmness, its well-maintained and perfect appearance,” D’Arenberg admits.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
“He was impeccable; time leaves no trace on him.”
This is what a princess says.
The Most Difficult Profession in the World: The Human Working Animals by Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur across the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by harvesting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to climb down to the bottom of its crater every day, where the sulfur-containing gas that flows out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilograms in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders across the descending stone paths.
While it’s only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2,386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb at the turtle’s pace while keeping the balance and taking their steps carefully so they don’t slip out and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who crashed on the slopes of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners at Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulfur they mine.
Arriving above, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the exhaustingly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been exploiting the volcano’s reservoirs since 1960 and (never to say better) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilogram of sulfur.
They then sell it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) each, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of timber, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who normally does three routes a day.
For each route he needs three hours, after which he is completely done, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable reward for such a purely inhumane effort, however, is three times what he would earn from field work.
"The daily salary of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) per day are paid for coffee harvesting and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not that hard, but Anto returned to Banyuwangi, a nearby village with his family, for a reason as important in Indonesia as sulfur: “I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam.”
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life on Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left his first traces on him, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to his dream.
"I will work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but punished by life young man could work as a tourist guide, waitress, or at a hotel reception, but instead he does the job of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden cabin with other carriers and wakes up at two o’clock every morning because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small front lamp on his helmet, which he bought for his own money.
About 400 carriers load baskets of sulfur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized the mining of sulfur to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to operators who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30.000 rupees (2.5 euros) fee per camera, which the guard of this natural park, along with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human bearing.
"This work is for the animals, not for man," protests Madrusin, a stumbling, 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as possible" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even when the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and clamps the miners in the thick columns rising from the crater, the men are so tough that nobody complains of serious illnesses ... of course except the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have been deformed by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, 53 years old, is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which is transported by three trucks over a goat path between the bush to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest, at the age of 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time goes by, but poverty holds generation after generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: the one of those who work as human burden seals at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame for not having children on careers, stress and the cost of real estate and parenting.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civil duty and create lives!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint candy, but nevertheless – or precisely because of that – they became a viral video on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song that contains local proverbs such as "Pushing a "bao" (Laib) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising firm BBH, which shot the video, is hoping that the advertisement will reach in a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is something just for the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to reproduction, we are the worst in the world, so we realized it was a matter we had to take care of.
We knew the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed dating evenings (fast flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why not do something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 The children
The one who does not take this issue easily is the government of Singapore.
Every year, she spends $1,300 on policy actions to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
So far, however, it has had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservationism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2—which is also known as replacement rate—was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Authority, says this is due to “better education” and “greater career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have significantly more choices in terms of life goals and prioritizing besides getting married and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the increased number of single people and the delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in birth rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to counter the population decline has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely hidden xenophobia is flourishing against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore scored its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs, and immigration policy, Singapore’s example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to that not so many small houses are being built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun controlling the number of small apartments known as “shoe boxes” that are allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show great sales success.
However, there is concern that they may promote the lifestyle of the single and that they will discourage construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate firm EL Developers, says his “shoe boxes” can be sold much faster than larger residential units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger residential units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
However, he acknowledges that the new standards give clearer guidance to developers who have previously been hindered by building too many small housing units within one project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, talks with Singaporeans working in the financial district show that they will not have much impact.
"People are heavily stressed, housing and even education are expensive, which is why it is postponed by many," says a young manager.
Children can get others.
"It's important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress, and the cost of ownership and education as reasons for not being able to have children.
That’s why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children – the government has so much to do.
Offline Private Offline is Online Private
privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the private property or “this area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any type of interference.”
What is private for someone under 16?
How is this definition applied to your everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet situations he’t share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five teenagers between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequently online.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with “something very special” on a personal level and “to the password and the user” when they applied it to social networks.
"I't reveal my deepest secrets in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of "private" on websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world," he confirmed.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend time with acquaintances.
“I’t share a photo that isn’t mine or someone who makes the foolish,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos of naked people, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
This includes the mother who has the password for one of the accounts.
I logged in to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone will answer me, I'm just calling them up," he added.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or to friends," he says.
When asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if someone recommended him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year-old is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask. In Ask, he admits not knowing 20 of the people he has added to his friend list.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, such as music," he said.
According to the boy, no one gave him any hints or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone harasses me or demands them from me, I'll simply remove them from my user account," he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with the experiences that are now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of a friend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He just did it privately.”
After that, it explains a series of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if he disliked me or I wanted to wipe out one.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, however, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants", formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives are the children and adolescents who have grown up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we are still learning,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic “because we require them to have a defined criterion on what can be disseminated, published, or said, and this at an age where maturity is not enough.”
"They should also be selective when it's most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is to ask them questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then mentions a few possibilities: There are things you’t tell a stranger.
Or: Would you like to be posted a photo of you, like the one you posted by a friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
Have you asked other people for permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question: Do everyone need to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to give them understanding that you need to trade online as you do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Someone outside of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the policies of social networks.
When you understand all the sections, you will have a solid foundation to talk to your children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
“For example, the age, or what you can share or publish,” he explains.
According to Guardia, children should be reminded of the lesson "You should not talk to strangers."
Unasur summit ends without publication of Lima declaration
The 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should theoretically be signed by the seven rulers present.
Efe has repeatedly attempted to gain access to the signed document at the 6th Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur.Sources in the State and Presidential Office initially informed that they would hand it over after the clause, but subsequently stated that it would be published on the website of the Peruvian government at some time.
Asked about the text, they stated that the content was explained by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, in the press room, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulating among journalists were received from the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document spread during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more information.
After that, the office of the Peruvian presidency sent an e-mail to the media containing the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was the declaration of Humala and not the official document concluding the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South America-Arab States Summit (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite press calls, the so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced, was not published.
On the official website of the ASPA, one can be convinced that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available for journalists, but they severely restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice resolving a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins in The Hague on Monday, in the trial that Lima initiated against Santiago, to listen to the claims of both sides.
“We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are presenting to this International Court of Justice,” Humala and his Chilean counterpart said.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, makes agreements and submits itself to international courts," Piñera added, greeting Humala with a handshake before the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the IGH came after Colombia filed a lawsuit against the Bogotá Agreement following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of that International Court of Justice.
At the summit were present the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after lunch time in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, in which he announced that 16 decisions were made and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries with a total investment of $17 billion were set.
On the decisions made, he said that the Unasur countries "will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be pushed forward to “improve cooperation in the fight against urban uncertainty and organized, transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and low-cost Internet in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters.”
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take triumphant traits, but should serve to expand our production capacity and show our peoples a better future," Humala added.
“We have decided to prioritize a series of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas... thus uniting our countries and uniting new forms of economy,” the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects would be five Peruvian, located on the cross-axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and of which two are meant to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country serves to re-enter it in the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region of prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to respectfully deal with the maritime conflict following a ruling of the IGH challenged by Bogotá.
“I’ll probably meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow,” Santos said.
"We will review all these routes - they are not exclusive, and even the agreement with Nicaragua makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this matter as civilised and respectful as possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega are scheduled to meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the 2013 action plan to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru holds the presidency for the period of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from citizens' integration," says Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that creating a common citizenship is a goal, with “South America actually learning something from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, told state television in Peru that Europeans “killed themselves in World War II and other conflicts” and “now are practically a homeland.”
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that pushes the member states of Unasur forward.
“The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the redesign of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the requirement of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those that have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return, we South Americans always sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is headquartered in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum Ecuador has granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that at the time "there were reasonable suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his proceedings would not be followed."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary for asking him to undergo an interrogation on his territory for a alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish jurisprudence allows this through a videoconference that could have been conducted via Ecuador’s embassy in London.”
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange’s health and mental condition would be compromised.
"Since he is in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a mild lung problem, but not a serious one," he said.
However, there is a risk that he will suffer physical and psychological damage because he is trapped in a narrow space and can not perform physical exercises outdoors.
“That would adversely affect everyone’s health,” he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum that has been granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London is to grant him a free letter to travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, leads a series of proceedings in different European instances,” he said.
And “if Britain gives this letter tomorrow, this is done in my opinion.”
And if Sweden interrogated Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as permitted by Swedish jurisprudence and in other cases, the problem was solved.
Correa took the opportunity to affirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press, saying that what he does not tolerate is “the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lies that deprive the freedom of expression.”
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador is no longer ruled by such journalists "and not even by the bankers or hegemonic and petty-bourgeois countries," and anticipated that in the event of a re-election he would "deep up the revolution to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the body "must remain tough and must not succumb to any opportunism or any legally disguised coup" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague that favoured the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime legal borders between the two countries, "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look ahead.
He also relied on a successful settlement of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if both countries commit to accept the ruling, even if it is very tough."
Regarding the possibility that he will run as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to reach his third term in a row, he said he sees this possibility “with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it also falls very hard.”
Correa assured that if he loses the election in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never been personally interested in power, but in such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
If I won, it would be my last term as president, after which I will withdraw from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
“It is decided,” he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of Venezuela’s President Hugo Chávez’s health problems in Cuba.
He told me that he had traveled there for a planned, routine treatment and that he would be expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any way mean a recurrence in President Chavez's health," he said.
The Ecuadorian leader attended today in Lima the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of a death due to AIDS is now too late to identify
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test confirmed he was HIV positive.
"It was like a bomb was hitting," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "weaken" without noticeable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it; and this with such dedication that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), to which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to an impasse."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, still many people come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and in whom the virus has already done harm and exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the appearance of the first cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," explained the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was backed up by a prestigious scientific publication in April of this year.
Andrade Villanueva, an expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, commented that scientists have concluded since 2008 that while AIDS is not a death sentence, the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the people’s immune system at the start of treatment, and that those who are not drug addicts have greater chances: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that anyone who gets the diagnosis of being HIV-positive at the age of 25 can, in this sense, "problemlessly reach 75 years of age as long as he is under control," this expert explained.
To correctly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even though mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011), it is still true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients recorded in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May this year there were already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
So why are people still dying from it?
The problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had any problems with the supply of the drugs.The problem is that people come in a very advanced state because they do not know their infection state, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: “Nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have an accompanying infection.In order to influence global mortality, earlier diagnosis is needed, which is why massive detection tests must be offered to all those who need it.”
This proposal is supported by experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by patients such as Fabrizio, who made his test in a private laboratory, and this for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor), which is one of the common complications.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die and don’t want to hear anything.
“If I have to die, I’d rather break three times,” they say.
The change was to improve, I eat well, do sports and take the medications.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
“I work, I do a lot, I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of my health and that of the other person,” says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today as part of the World AIDS Day.
The sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the table
There are huge gaps between health programs and the common citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken on the cause of HIV.
The most important thing is prevention.
“The distribution of condoms was actually increased; before they were handed out individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is good, but there are still people who don’t have access to a condom,” he said.
Among the people at risk for new infections are young people.
"Why do you need it?" is a widespread mocking question from social workers, school orientation staff, pharmacy employees, and the healthcare system that young people don't want to expose themselves to, the correspondent assured.
He proposed reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be placed not only behind the counter table, but in output devices in public toilets of establishments frequently visited by young people.
It is not to promote promiscuity.
They are not to be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look like that; it’s best to bring condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity,” he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks fourth nationally for new and cumulative cases of AIDS, and thirteenth in terms of HIV.
92% of infections occur through sexual intercourse, 6% through blood, and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for every registered case there are 4 or 5 people who don’t know about it.
After the U.S. Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling not recognizing the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s liabilities achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedent is being created for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
So one could say that the procedures for the survival of companies that the Mexican laws allow are not valid in the country of the Stars and Stripes in violation of international agreements.
In practice, the judge Harlin Hale’s recognition of the judgment on June 15 at the Bancarrotas Court for the Northern District of Texas leads Mexican companies to be helplessly exposed to the confiscation of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door and door for Mexico’s largest glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to the United States bankruptcy law, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal first says that the main case is the Mexican trade bankruptcy.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a transnational profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for Unification of International Commercial Law was created, using the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass which Vitro’s branches had with their parent company, the majority required for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been reached.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities with companies in the group have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
Moreover, it is true that, after the deduction of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who appealed against Vitro before the U.S. courts, i.e. the geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote was 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation since 2008 as part of the major economic crisis in the United States that hit the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family objected to the same Court of Appeal so that the vote would take place in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If it is not accepted, the Cerciorare complaint will be filed, requesting the review of the proceedings by a higher instance, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court.
The gravity of this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), describing the procedure conducted by Vitro under the Commercial Competition Act, and stating that it had strictly complied with the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has subjected itself to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-band caramboles: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
The general balance sheet
After the Mexican aviation trade unions’ charges against former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, failed for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores has finally made progress.
The petition, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, accused of obstructing justice.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the main administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the trust account F/589 of Bank IXE in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used to acquire shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society have decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing) has achieved to unite the governors in the Southeast to resist the monumental establishment that partly destroyed protected areas and constitutes the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government has failed to comply with a Senate request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, the matter has already been filed, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken even though the Senate had overlooked the possibility because it considered them a violation of the freedom of expression in social networks.
Homeopathy in the Long Term
In an effort to pay off long-term liabilities without compromising short-term liabilities, Homex markets securities worth over 500 million pesos.
The issuance is the first of four equal issuances that promise to pay interest every 28 days.
Establishment of Competitive
Formed by the companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies has been established under the name Competival, whose goal is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment amounts to more than $1.5 billion.
Héctor “Hetin” Reyes: “Basketball was my life”
The world champion of basketball, Héctor “Hetin” Reyes, has been associated with basketball for more than 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a vast spiritual collection of the country’s basketball history as Héctor “Hetin” Reyes.
Before being tied to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, commissioner and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
“Over my life I’ve put on many hats in basketball, even several at once, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s,” Reyes recalled while visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his home are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the Heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-director or managing director of the club.
“These were my best years that I’ve most because I’ve been part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as a CEO, co-CEO or coach.
It has been many fulfilling years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then on, Cuco took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager,” says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, “I have a very strong and 2m tall player.
Do you want him?”
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free-throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who became a citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I still know when we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States for the first time.
Then came the world championship in 1990, where we took fourth place, which would have been bronze if it had not been this Canadian referee who allowed us to repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Championship the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favourite is the team at the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, where we won gold and offered the team of the United States a fight, like when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
With that team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there because of a knee injury in 1990.
One team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players who were blocked due to the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Piculín.
And this without considering his career in the various leagues in which he has played.
Who is the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the club?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you still have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, children make unnecessary trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I love listening to music, watching videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and occasionally going to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, and became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series “Dallas” became a symbol of the 80s greed, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon from cancer complications, according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the Harvest Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and sequel series, was with Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, her publisher Jeffrey Lane said.
He delighted all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known on television as a nice guy from 1965 to 1970 with NBC's sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie".
There, he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "jin" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He also starred in two short-term comedies, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly disgusting J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic CBS television series about the Ewing Clan and other characters around it was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The "Who shot J.R.?" advertisement, which was meant to create expectations for an episode full of emotions where Hagmann's character was killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The series achieved a record audience at the time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, turning "Dallas" into the second most watched entertainment show since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the daughter-in-law of J.R. (played by Mary Crosby) who shot.
J.R. had compelled her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) testify.
“I know what should be on J.R.’s tombstone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he has not won.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a “enormous personality on and off the screen.”
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of worshippers around the world and remains in our hearts to us who have been lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast with great success on TNT television channel a few months ago.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just being filmed, the broadcaster informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT on how Hagmann’s loss in the series would be treated.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stage in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published his memoirs, “Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.”
"I did not write anything that I thought could harm anyone or affect them in any way," he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he became a liver donor and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help anxious patients.
"I will advise them, give them courage, I will meet with them when their operations are ahead and after," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as “don’t worry, it’s a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you’ll get well.”
He also advocated against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of the course that studies the "end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long countdown" of the Maya calendar on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what would await him in the next two months: the devastating Hurricane Sandy, which some have referred to as "Deudarmaggedon," as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only professor offering courses on the “end of the world” this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
At Temple, assistant professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We are analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and explored how they could be compared to real life.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what’s possible, likely, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course called “The End of the World.”
"We're not taking 2012 so we always have the option of being able to resume the course in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "coming downfall", students are required to study, create projects, and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is conducted on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why students have no choice but to “continue working until the night where the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"There were no more seats in two hours," Restall said of his high-average student course, which filled up with 35 students.
Weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students asking if there were still vacancies.
Students say the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is actually just a matter of comfort or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard anything about a class where this is taught,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less yet a professor - stated that they believed in the final date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in a certain way we are discrediting it," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year at Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that dates back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
“People elsewhere don’t think so,” he says.
This is mostly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course about the “end of the world” there.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he wrote as a hint to an exception from a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that many days of the Last Judgment were talked about over the years, saying that if nothing happened on December 21, "people immediately thought of a new date" or philosophized that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrate about “the end of the world.”
"Maybe I'll call a couple of friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student of communications.
