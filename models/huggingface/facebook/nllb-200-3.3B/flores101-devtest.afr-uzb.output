Most disruptions of technological terms share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, produces effects on society that are innate, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Massive vehicle ownership also leads to accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for repairing damaged bodies.
