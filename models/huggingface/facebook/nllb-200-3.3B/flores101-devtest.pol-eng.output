This confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is the popular theory, but also provides details like color and three-dimensional layout that you can't get from fossils.
According to scientists, the animal's fur was chestnut on the upper surface and light or carotene on the lower.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed trunk called a stalk, but have other features - feathers  radius and prominence  - scientists concluded that the stalk was likely a later evolutionary stage than these other features.
The feather structure indicates that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or display, and scientists believe that this is the feather of an adult, not a chick, although the tail belonged to a young dinosaur.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the plumage of the specimen indicates an adult, not a chick.
A car bomb detonated yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two officers and injuring more than twenty.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon affects the Earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts its power on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have been able to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that standard matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter is surrounding the galaxy like some kind of halo, made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered an extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "very troubling and worrying because of its high mortality rate".

Relative to the surrounding area, they have lower temperatures during the day and higher temperatures at night.
"The thermal environment here is not as stable as in large caves on Earth, where the temperature often remains constant, but this is because of the deep holes", said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff.
In France, voting was usually a low-tech process: Voters cast their ballot in a voting booth, and then put a printed ballot card with the name of their chosen candidate in an envelope.
Once the officials have verified the identity of the voter, he puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law is quite strict about procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can be sure that there are no envelopes in the ballot box when the polling station is opened and that no envelopes are thrown into it except those of duly registered and authorised voters.
Candidates are able to send their representatives to observe each stage of the process, and in the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered a stolen laptop and a mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five men who raped a Swiss woman, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The following persons have been named as the accused: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki has stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit him, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially placed in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since appeared in the Edinburgh District Court on charges of murdering his son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony may be unreliable because her image has been widely publicized.
It's a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts think that publishing the photographs can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that 'journalists are entering dangerous territory by publishing photos of suspects and so on.'
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for the overall investigation, told reporters that any further comment would be withheld until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will be about the disputed borders that Palestine wants to restore to the state before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, the holy city of both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel has demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement was signed, and the PA has agreed to such a presence for only five years.
The shooters participating in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by the foresters, as the test was monitored and subject to an evaluation of effectiveness.
The NPWS and the NSW Sport Shooting Association have partnered to recruit qualified volunteers through the NSW Sport Shooting Association's hunting programme.
Mick O'Flynn, the conservation and heritage director of NPSW Park, believes that the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a member of the newly formed Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission requested the dissolution of the previous Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to speed up the country's new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were a reflection of the lack of elections, which have been blocked in some cases since 2011.
There have been over 60 reported cases of iPods malfunctioning due to overheating, which has caused six fires, and four people have been slightly burned.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, calling them "snow-deadly".
When Apple postponed the report, the department called the decision "very unfortunate".
The quake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said the country was not affected.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there are no signs of a tsunami.
A bus carrying tourists from Hong Kong was hijacked in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, by a former Filipino policeman who took the passengers hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been declared dead.
The Filipino photographers and six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier.
Then the photographers took the place of an old woman who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins used his time off to start research on preterm birth.
His study showed that the introduction of the hormone would accelerate the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that a government investigation on Wednesday recovered the black boxes.
So the wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme, and she died on the night of the double moon, which was as special as she was, a strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels said Luna was as crazy as I was... or maybe even more... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... and I can only hope she's better now.
A survey of 1,400 people was conducted before the 2010 federal election, and the percentage of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% from 2008.
Supervisory Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic with the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of respondents agree with this and want Queen Elizabeth to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme points of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was set to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but as he complained about his form, doubts were raised about his expected results.
The pain medication was forbidden by the rules of the games, so he couldn't take it.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
By early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using other hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets brought water to Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to learn about the process of planet formation, especially how it happened on Earth, because comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed into law a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and nonsense".
There's been speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
Using satellite technology instead of older-generation radar technology allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
There will be no additional transport options, no overground trains will stop at Wembley, and furthermore, car parks and park-and-ride facilities will be inaccessible in the ground area.
The potential lack of transport has made it more likely that the match will be played behind closed doors, without the participation of the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Scientists at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that a new species had been created in just two generations, although it was thought that the process took considerably longer, based on the reproduction of Darwin's finches, black darwin, cactus darwin, and coarse darwin.
Gold can be cut into many shapes, even the smallest.
They can be stretched into thin threads that can be twisted and braided, and they can be unfolded or rolled on sheets.
It can be thinly sanded and glued to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
We call this the chemical's pH index, and the juice from the red cabbage has the ability to detect pH.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H, abbreviated pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (a hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then with clean, wet hands, squeeze them together to form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a modern sewer system.
In houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, the remains of a sewage system were discovered.
Toilets were also known in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets sometimes belonged to public baths, where men and women shared a common bath.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The call goes to a satellite in space, and then it bounces back almost immediately,
Scientists use telescopes placed in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts the light, and thus the image seen from Earth.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space requires the use of a huge rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in many amazing ways, but most of all, it has made transportation much easier and faster.
Without it, there would be no rail lines, no cars, and no other means of transportation.
Below are the medium-sized cats, feeding on the medium-sized prey: rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic ones) that eat much more of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the niche, in the special task that each cat performs, which makes it impossible for them to compete with the others.
Lions are among the most sociable of cats, and they live in large flocks.
A lion herd consists of one, two, or three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Groups of lions behave like a pack of wolves or a pack of dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior and the deadly threat they pose to their prey.
A well-built athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump for considerable distances, and pull five times as fast as a strong man.
The tiger, along with the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, is one of the four species of panthers that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not as loud as that of a lion, but it is more like a rattling, shouted word.
The ocelot prefers small animals, hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds wherever possible, but most of the ocelot's prey is much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that the ocelots track and find food by smell.
They have excellent night vision, and they move stealthily, hunting their prey, blending in with their surroundings, and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (e.g. when moving up a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island, with no easy escape route), it is often in a different environment from the previous one.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to develop new traits or adapt in a way that they can compete effectively in their new environment.
The original population hasn't changed a bit and it's still having to adapt.
Over time, as a new population adapts to a new environment, they become less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much that it will be difficult to call them one species.
This process is called speciation, which is simply the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to produce nutrients and plants to produce shade.
Our homes are made from plants, just as our clothes are made from plants, and most of our food is made from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mozazaur was the biggest predator at the time, so he was only afraid of other mozaurids.
With over 70 extraordinarily sharp teeth in its elongated jaws, and an extra set of teeth protruding from the lower jaw, it was unlikely that any of its victims would have been able to contact it.
We're not entirely sure, but it could have had a forked tongue, it could have fed on turtles, big fish, other molasses, it could have been a cannibal.
It didn't shy away from attacking its victims in the water, and even a dinosaur as massive as a T. rex must have felt a sense of awe.
Although most of the foods that the Romans ate are familiar to us, they also featured some exotic foods, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and porcupines.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their meals sitting on stools, while the rich met at banquets, where they ate in a semi-recumbent position.
Ancient Roman dishes could not have contained the ingredients that would have found their way to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not know corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
In Babylon each god had a temple dedicated to him and considered his home.
The sacrifices to the gods were made by humans, and the priests were responsible for the divine needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, behind which was the inner sanctuary, accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
A special sanctuary dedicated to the god was located at the top of the tower.
The home was not particularly important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent in the air.
Women prepared food in the backyards, shops were just shelves facing the street, and stones were used to build houses.
Since the land of Canaan was devoid of large forests, the price of timber was very high.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and according to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his journey westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
While not belittling his role as an explorer, it should be noted that Eskimo tribes were already inhabiting the area at that time.
Although each country could be described as "Scandinavian", Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differ from one another in people, rulers, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie "Treasure of Nations", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence was a map with a road to the treasure.
There are some inscriptions on the back of the document, but it's not a treasure map.
On the second page of the Declaration of Independence were the words: The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that the large parchment document (9.75 by 24.5 inches) was originally carved for storage.
It can therefore be assumed that the annotation was added as a descriptive label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent clashes resulted in the liberation of northern France, but the south remained under occupation.
The French Vichy had the power to do that, and they were the people from France who made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the aggressors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France, known as Operation Dragoon.
It took just two weeks for the US and Free French forces to liberate southern France and move towards Germany.
A civilization is one culture shared by a fairly large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, which is cognate with civitas, or citizen, and civitas, which is a city or city-state, which indicates the size of a community.
The city-states were the prototypes of the nations, and the culture of civilization is the transmission of knowledge across generations, the making of a lasting cultural imprint, and the equitable distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving a significant historical record, and thus cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the 13 states first established a flimsy central government, whose only element was Congress, based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, who often were unwilling to cooperate in enforcing all of their laws.
Furthermore, it had no power to override the laws and rates of taxation between the states.
The Articles required the unanimous approval of all states before any changes could be made, and the states treated the central government with such contempt that their representatives often did not appear.
The Italian national football team is ranked second in the world football rankings, next to the German team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italian athletes participate in international tournaments and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster of islands it has, Japan is often called an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors spelled the island's name Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
When the Dutch East India Company established a factory in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, it began to change native grain production practices and employed Chinese to work on rice and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, Qing (1644-1912) forces seized the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Within Machu Picchu, three main sites stand out: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
To give visitors a better idea of the site's original appearance, most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt.
By 1976, one third of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the process continues.
For example, in photography, the most commonly used format is 35 mm, the most common film size in the early days of analog film.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, this image format has been transferred to the matrix formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high, which is confusing.
So the ratio of the format (we divide by twelve to get the simplest total ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS group of formats) are identical or closely resemble this ratio.
The rule of thirds is often abused or ridiculed, but it's a simple guideline to help you achieve the effect of dynamism without disturbing order.
He says that the ideal location for the main subject is the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three equal parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and prosperous, came under close scrutiny.
For more than a millennium, the Christian religion has provided a vital link between European countries that differ in language and customs.
His power was so pervasive that it affected everyone, from the king to the peasant.
One of Christendom's main tenets is that wealth should be used to help the poor and needy and that church funds should be used for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raises the question of whether this doctrine is being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy effectively cut off key military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law as enshrined in several international agreements made over the previous two centuries.
Britain had mined areas of international waters to block ships from entering vast swaths of the ocean, endangering even neutral shipping vessels.
This tactic met with limited response, so the Germans expected a similar situation for their unforgiving underwater warfare operations.
The twentieth century has been marked by a pacifist attitude and the isolation of most nations and citizens.
After the terrible and cruel experiences of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York.
He set foot on American soil with 4 cents in his pocket, a volume of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the different periods were uniquely shown; each stage in China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
In the transitional periods of no-king between successive dynasties, the provinces were divided and confused, and the Three Kingdoms period of 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties is the most famous such period.
Many of the notables who claimed the throne were in fierce competition with each other during these periods.
The Three Kingdoms era was recorded in ancient Chinese history as a period of great bloodshed; thousands of people died fighting for the supreme throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not just to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, all male candidates were given free access to the professions, allowing success to be achieved by those who showed the most ambition and resourcefulness.
The same is true of the military, because the ranks of the army, which were once based on class, are now based on the sword.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many oppressed working class people in other countries to start revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues beyond his ordinary life, and he often went to contemplate the cave known as Hira on the mountain Noor (Mountain of Light).
The preserved cave itself gives a very colorful insight into Muhammad's spiritual predilections.
The cave, located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It's not easy to find, even if you know it's there, because inside the cave, the visitor is completely isolated.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and from inside the cave, you can't see or hear much of the outside world.
The only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramids built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau (also called the Giza Necropolis) in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several tombs of smaller sizes, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Cheops' wives and relatives.
The symbol 'up' looks like the letter 'V', and the symbol 'down' looks like a square with no lower edge.
Up means you start at the top and press the bow, and down means you start at the scissors (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Moving the string from bottom to top produces a softer sound, and moving the string from top to bottom produces a stronger, more decisive sound.
Don't be afraid to draw your own signs, but remember that the signs on the string are there for musical reasons, so you should generally stick to them.
The mob of corrupt officials forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4), and Elizabeth, the king's sister, to return from Versailles to Paris.
As the king and queen rode back to Paris, they were accompanied by a cheering crowd, who threw threats at them.
A furious mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of the prison.
At one point, a person in the crowd shook the head of a guard who had been killed at Versailles right in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenses of the imperialist United States for the conquest of the Philippines were covered by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were floated on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the great profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would be the primary profits of U.S. imperialism.
The context in which the Order of the Templars was founded is important in understanding its specificity.
These events belong to the era commonly called the Late Middle Ages, which covered the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (1000 to 1300 C.E.).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism encompasses a wide range of ideas applied in practice, including technological impulse or technological imperative, and a strict determination of human destiny driven by the hidden logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in the field of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism combine two general principles: first, the process of technology development itself is not subject to cultural or political influences, and second, technology generates effects in societies that are immanent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you could say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of the road network.
As the national road network is not economically viable when the number of vehicles is negligible, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of running a vehicle.
The mass car ownership also leads to an increase in traffic accidents and, in turn, to the development of new ways of medicine to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained an important element of cultural determinism, which can be found in the writings of such authors as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, individuals were shaped by geography, and over time, geography-related customs and culture developed that were so much in tune with the place of society that they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the modern fashion capital, so Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a haven of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1000 C.E.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely because returning Crusaders brought goods such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what was offered at Byzantine fairs.
It was then that the fashion capital of Constantinople was moved to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith in the 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
But because the exchange of information was slow, Western styles may have developed with a delay of 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to shape its own style, and one of the greatest achievements of this time, as a consequence of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture means that a farmer produces enough food to satisfy his own needs and those of his family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system using self-sufficient seed from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively easy methods of maximising yield.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures attract people who share similar attitudes to the world, people who feel that social norms do not meet their needs, people who find a sense of identity within the subculture.
Subcultures are distinct in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture in its distinctiveness may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
If you are a member of a subculture, you show it through a distinctive and symbolic style that includes fashion, mannerism and slang.
One of the most popular ways of portraying the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their adolescence, whether due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse.
Such children are referred to as "wild" or "disabled", and some of them have been imprisoned (usually by their parents), and some have been abandoned because the parents were unable to accept the serious mental or physical disability of their child.
Before the abandonment or escape, the runaway children may have suffered trauma or abuse.
Others are thought to have been raised by them, and some are said to be living in the wild on their own.
If a feral child is cared for by animals alone, he will behave almost exactly (considering physical limitations) as those animals do, showing fear or indifference toward humans.
The project approach should make learning easier and more attractive, while the scaffolding approach takes it one step further.
The scaffolding method is not a way of learning, but rather a support provided to people who participate in new learning experiences, e.g. using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual and real, meaning the teacher is a kind of scaffolding, just like Mr. Spin in the MS Office suite.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software and is intended to challenge, suggest and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to understand on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even coercion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that doesn't provide them with upbringing, care and education, but unfortunately, that's what happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and good medical care.
The foster family is supposed to meet any needs that weren't met in the home they were taken from.
The Internet can be used for both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet open up new dimensions in terms of how people use it and how they approach reward.
For example, 'learning' and 'connecting with others' are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and long-term relationships were also identified by Eighemey and McCorda (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they studied audience responses to websites.
Video recordings have made important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it says that you can tell if a person is lying by reading their microexpressions correctly.
In an article entitled "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks argues that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are still able to correctly evaluate the sincerity of the speaker.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may also be possessed by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Scientific research over the 20th century has revealed that there are two kinds of genetic variation - one hidden and the other expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, while selection removes the variation from the pool of expressed genes.
With each generation, there is a mutual exchange of variability between the two pools through segregation and recombination.
Plants on the savanna barely allow primates with digestive systems like ours to meet the body's need for amino acids.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition, and death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins contained in the leaves and the pods, but for primates like us, they're difficult to digest without being cooked first.
Animal foods (ant, termite, egg) are different, being easily digestible and providing high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do today on the savanna.
Sleep interruption is the deliberate awakening during normal sleep and re-entering sleep after 1060 minutes.
It's not difficult if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores consciousness but doesn't completely knock it out.
If you find yourself resetting your watch while you sleep, you can put it across the room, which will force you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based methods recommend drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which is diuretic) before going to bed, so that you have to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace is inversely proportional to the inner and physical tension of the person.
The less stress there is, the more positive life force there is, and every person has the potential to find total peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it also includes the Mahayana path of love and numerous Indian yoga techniques.
The premise of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, and it includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the practice of awakening the kundalini energy (or the energy of enlightenment) through asanas, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central focus of Tibetan meditation is the deity yoga, and visualizing the various deities clears energy channels, activates chakras, and creates a consciousness of enlightenment.
During World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union were allied against a common enemy, Germany, but when the war ended, a radical clash of systems, processes and cultures divided the two nations.
It's been two years since the end of the war, when the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to span the next 40 years and encompass real-world combat by replacement armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian front.
However, these plans quickly became obsolete when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of eastern Poland, thus violating the provisions of the Russo-Soviet Peace, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of goods and people across the oceans.
The Navy's job has always been to keep the nation safe from the movement of its people and goods, while preventing the enemy from moving its people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign of World War II was one of the most famous examples in recent history, where the Americans tried to help the British by throwing men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, was trying to block these overflows.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats probably occurred in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for their milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in flocks that roamed the hills or other pastures, often guarded by shepherd-like goat-drivers, usually children or teenagers, and these breeding methods are still used.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks were built on parallel wooden planks, the horses could travel faster and transport heavier loads than on the paved roads of the day.
Rail-mounted railway beds appeared relatively early, but it was gradually understood that iron railings would be needed to increase the efficiency of the tracks.
This became a common practice, but iron contributed to the greater wear of wooden wagon wheels.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of human movement was walking, and humans began walking upright about two million years ago, hence the name Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, were not used to walking upright.
Forms of bipedalism can be found in the fossil record of the Australopithecus, dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the green movement, and we can even take on the role of activists to help to some extent reduce the amount of suffering in the future.
This is often similar to symptomatic treatment, but to avoid a temporary solution, the source of the problem must be identified and eliminated.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of scientific and technological advances, and overcrowding and extravagant lifestyles have exacerbated the problems.
On July 4, when the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress, a handwritten version of it signed by John Hancock, the President of Congress, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies, known today as "Dunlap broadsides", were printed overnight.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops on July 9 in New York, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap bulletins that still exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived, but the original has not survived.
Many paleontologists say that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their hind legs, just like the T-Rex.
In fact, all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded as a binary system.
A binary number can have a value of 0 or 1, and these kinds of numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning does not necessarily manifest itself immediately, but symptoms such as vomiting are so general that they do not warrant immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of poisoning is the presence of an open package of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label instructions for first aid for this particular poisoning.
The name worm is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from ancient times, when bedbugs were insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and house bugs are nest-builders, adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their host.
There are about 400,000 reported cases of MS in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The risk of MS is twice as high in women as in men, according to the results of the studies.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the child's.
These couples can decide to prepare an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption is when the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can be the parents of the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to discover the workings of the world by using the scientific method, which is the basis for most scientific research.
But it's not the only method; an experiment is a test that allows you to reject one or more possible hypotheses.
The classical texts, especially the Latin Bible, formed the basis of the studies of naturalists and philosophers.
Aristotle's views have been adopted in all scientific fields, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend essentially on the existence of endogenous cycles and their creation by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms that are not merely responses to external periodic stimuli have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that persist throughout the cycle, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the same bacteriophages or viruses to implant bacteria with their own DNA.
Two experiments were conducted, one involving labeling DNA in a flask using radioactive phosphorus, and the other involving labeling the flask protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects, depending on their type, the importance of the genetic material involved and whether the cells affected are chambers of the germ line.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be passed to children; mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in exploring natural areas, admiring landscapes, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as park visits and ecosystem information gathering.
For example, we can go to Borneo to take photos and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, people drive out of their small towns to go to work, passing by people who drive to the places they've just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone participates in some way in the transport system based on private vehicles and supports this system.
Now science is showing that the vast carbon economy has eroded the biosphere from its steady state that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is a participant in society and uses transportation, and almost everyone complains about transportation.
In developed lands, such complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges are rare.
Why are there so many complaints about the transportation system, why are there irregularities in its operation every day? Are the engineers responsible for it, or is the problem much deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of individual drivers and vehicles moving between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
There's no way to predict the behavior of drivers with 100% certainty, so unfortunately, traffic flow testing is a challenge.
Fortunately, the behaviour of the drivers is generally consistent; therefore, the traffic flows also show some consistency and can be approximated by mathematical calculations.
The relationships between the three key characteristics, namely (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed, allow a better representation of traffic.
Planning, design and operation of road facilities use such relationships.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have a useful ability to fold their wings along the trunk.
This gives them a greater choice of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that do not have the ability to fold their wings are the wasps and hornets.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought that he was right, while others held the opposite view, namely, that the solar system, including the sun and other stars, revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest river in the world, and it carries eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, and in some places it is nearly six miles wide.
The Amazon is responsible for 20 percent of the water from the rivers that feed the oceans on Earth.
The Amazon in its mainstream is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of small tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, they were never surpassed in size and technical perfection by the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom looked with awe at the structures of their ancestors, which had been in existence for over a thousand years.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
In its legislation and official communications, the Vatican uses Italian.
Most of the people who work in Italy speak Italian in their daily life, and Latin is often heard in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, were known to man in ancient times because they are found in nature in their natural form and can be extracted relatively easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a combination of at least one of four elements, which were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized about how they would change into new substances that shape what we see.
Alloy can be defined as a mixture of two or more metals, and it's important to remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Calcium and potassium are considered to be metals, but of course, silver and gold are also metals.
There may also be alloys which contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, e.g. carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so unimaginably microscopic that a dot at the end of this puzzle would fit trillions of them.
So when the pencil came along, it became a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of modern writing, the pencil lost its status and its use.
People are writing news now using computer screens and they don't need any templates.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to connect the nucleus with many protons and neurons.
It's like pulling a heavy cart upside down, and splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that disintegrate with little or no friction.
The surface of the moon is covered with rock and dust, and the outer layer of the planet is called the crust.
The cover is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the moon's seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more areas of maria on the visible side, because the crust is less thick here and the lava was easier to penetrate to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people like and what appeals to them.
Theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been acquired in the process of growing up into adulthood.
These theories are about what makes some people want to do what they do and what in their environment makes them do certain things and not do others.
Two popular theories of content are the Maslow's pyramid of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start to lead their former colleagues, there are two types of behaviour that can occur: one is trying to remain a member of the team (or one).
This type of manager is reluctant to make unpopular decisions, avoids disciplinary action, and shuns performance evaluations, assignments, and billing people for work done.
The other extreme is to unknowingly transform yourself into someone who feels you have to change everything the team has done, to subordinate it to your own vision.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often results in friction between the leader and the rest of the team.
For virtual teams, the same standards of excellence apply, but there are subtle differences.
The virtual team members often act as a point of contact for the physical group directly related to them.
They often have more freedom than regular team members, because their teams can schedule meetings according to different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible group' is the management body to which all members are subject.
Why would a company want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity flourish when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of the organisation.
As a result, collaboration within the organisation to overcome barriers can lead to an innovative process that meets the needs of customers.
In order for an organisation to become innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, sharing knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that helps organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and that narrows the field of study and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supporting the scientific research that's being done.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and lead to altered mental function.
With new technology, we can observe and study previously unknown brain structures and processes.
We're taking a lot of information and material from that to build simulation models that allow us to better understand what's going on in the human mind.
While AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is also a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research is about building machines to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples are: control and planning, the ability to respond to customer statements and questions, and to recognize handwriting, voice and faces.
These things became separate fields, focused on providing solutions to real life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now widely used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and military technology, and are also used as embedded elements in several applications used in personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any class, and often a teacher would be eager to take her students to places where buses do not go.
The technology allows for virtual field trips, allowing students to see museum collections, visit an aquarium or admire artwork from the comfort of their classroom.
By sharing the field trip in virtual mode, you can stimulate reflection on it and share experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year, the page is changed, but the old versions remain online as an album.
Blogging can help students improve their writing skills, and often when they start blogging, their grammar and spelling are not at their peak, but the presence of readers usually changes that.
Blogger is beginning to make efforts to improve the quality of his writing and avoid criticism, as students often fail the most rigorous grades.
In addition, blogging helps students to become more aware of the world around them.The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to offer intelligent and interesting content (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool to inspire collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
By using blogs appropriately, 'students can become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online posts, they can express their own views on other people's work and outline their own perspective on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, with many art galleries and museums, presenting Canada's past and present.
To the south, Niagara Falls, and to the north, the pristine beauty of the Muscogee and surrounding regions.
All of these things - and more - clearly indicate that Ontario is considered by outsiders to be the quintessence of Canada.
The vast areas further north are sparsely populated, some of them practically uninhabited wilderness.
This comparison comes as a surprise to many: the number of African-Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, east of the African coast.
Madagascar is the largest, but it is also a continent in its own right.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or allied nations of France and are known for their luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which was firmly embraced in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European exits and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that every woman on the trip should claim to be married regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (unless it looks too expensive.
Women should know that cultural differences can cause behaviour that they consider harassment, they can often be followed, they can be grabbed by the hand, etc.
Say no to men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century B.C.E. by Berber fishermen and served the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merodites as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badya, and Spanish merchants who had trading bases there called it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is the last place in Morocco.
Traditional Moroccan goods such as Tajins, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and a variety of trinkets can be easily purchased in the old medina, but these are typically for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the eastern end of the country near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted, burying most of the city's streets and especially its downtown.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside of Goma should be pre-checked for the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
From the city, you can go for a hike to the Nyiragongo volcano, and you can also go for a mountain gorilla hunt, which is one of the cheapest options in Africa.
The standard (local) price for a short ride is about 500 CFA francs.
In the context of its relatively inaccessible location, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, yet its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the city was placed on the list of World Heritage Sites in danger because of the destruction caused by desert sand.
He was one of the main stops on the Henry Louis Gates special on PBS called "The Wonder of the African World".
This city is definitely different from the rest of the country because it has more of an Arab climate than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each with its own unique flora and fauna.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
There are daily guard fees and park admission fees, as in all other South African national parks.
The purchase of a wild card may be advantageous, since it gives access to selected parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is a major attraction for many tourists.
The rows of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong have been compared to the glittering column chart of Victoria Bay.
The best views of Hong Kong are from the Kowloon waterfront, across from the city.
The vast majority of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place occupied by British colonizers, so it's a good place to start looking for traces of the territory's colonial past.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest belt of mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline into deep Bangladesh and Indian territory.
The Sundarbans are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in India is called the Sundarban National Park.
But these forests are not just the backwaters of the past. They are also the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Indian Plains.
The Sundarbans have an area of 3850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water and swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 tiger lions living there.
Buses leave from the inter-regional bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most depart between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang.
It is best to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as the buses between the districts are often crowded.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable, and durable Japanese shore-side buses.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means of transport to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two traffic lanes 3.5 meters wide.
The bridge has a vertical span of 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be ready for use in September 2017, when the construction of the Brazilian customs posts is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in the region of today's eastern Paraguay, leading a semi-nomadic life of hunting and struggling agriculture to meet their own needs.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the GuaycurÃº and PayaguÃ¡, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, once called the "Great Province of India", was founded in the 16th century as a result of clashes between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields of Las CaÃ±itas.
In other months, smaller tournaments and games are also available.
The AsociaciÃ³n Argentina de Polo offers more information about the games and tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
Payments in British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, credit cards are accepted in Stanley, and American dollars are often accepted.
You should not rely on a card when staying on the outermost islands, although British and American currency may be accepted; it is best to ask the owners in advance for the form of payment.
It's almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so you should exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer is summer in the northern hemisphere, and winter is winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone, which means that temperatures often exceed +30Â°C in the summer months.
Winter may be colder than it seems: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but when combined with wind and moisture, the feeling of cold is greater than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "dry" and "wet" seasons, and the amount of rainfall is essentially the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to the sight of humans, they are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend that you keep at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
Although they may look benign, buffalo, elk, bear, and almost any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they don't keep their distance, and these are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals that need space.
Also, be aware that the scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and is home to fewer than 40,000 people.
In the 1950s, the city of Apia was founded, and it became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
It was here that the infamous naval stalemate of 1889 occurred, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city ended with the killing of the main Tupua leader, Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland stretches between two bays, so there are many beaches, and the most popular ones are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy, with safe bathing areas, and most of the shade is provided by metrosideros trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Bay, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are often crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops filling the waterfront.
The main local beer is the Number One, which is not a complicated beer but a pleasant and refreshing one.
It's worth stocking up on a variety of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for the trip.
You can drink the tap water here without any worries, but if you have any doubts, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the concept of coffee is "flat white", the small black is "espresso", the cappuccino is filled to the brim with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're delicious.
Many reef expeditions are year-round, and reef injuries caused by any of these causes are rare.
But take the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The perch is found near the beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of 1770, and occasionally beyond that period.
No one denies the existence of sharks, but the rarity of their attacks on humans is that most of these creatures are afraid of contact with humans and will swim away.
The pink crocodiles are not active in the oceans, their primary habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, a traveler does not have to worry about having a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies usually work with specific hotels, although it is possible to book a different form of accommodation with a travel agent, for example a campsite.
The travel agency offers packages that include breakfast, airport/airport transport, as well as combined flight and hotel packages.
Your reservation may be extended if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents needed at your destination (e.g. visas).
Any corrections or requests should go to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
For music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to stay on site, most of them considering it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be near the action, you have to arrive early to find a campsite near the music.
It should be noted that even after the main stages have closed, some sections of the festival will still be filled with music until late at night.
Some festivals offer camping areas for families with young children.
When crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin position, as traveling through the ice generates a terrible noise for those most affected.
Travel outside of St. Petersburg includes time in the city.
Casinos tend to make sure that guests stay as long as possible and leave as much money as possible, so there are no windows or clocks, and it's hard to find a way out.
They usually have special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests entertained and entertained.
Some bars offer alcohol on a charge, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know the value of a sober mind.
When driving at high latitudes or through mountain passes, consider conditions such as snow, ice and sub-zero temperatures.
The ice and snow cover the roads with little friction, so it is not possible to drive as on a clear asphalt.
When a snowstorm is raging, it can quickly snow so much that the road becomes impassable.
Visible areas may also be limited by snow or snow drifts or by drops or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many countries, where traffic flows freely year-round.
The safari is arguably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of the day for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to a trip by land to see the beauty of African nature, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for appropriate viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy, so it's best to observe them with binoculars.
A walking safari can last from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will begin on August 24 and run through September 5, 2012, with some events being hosted at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice (the first time was in 1964).
If you booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the change in date was announced, you may be in trouble.
The rules for cancellations vary, but most coronavirus cancellations in late March do not include July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
As expected, most event tickets will range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Pressing can speed up the drying of damp clothes, and many hotels rent irons and ironing boards if they do not have them in their rooms.
If you do not have an iron or do not want to wear socks that have been pressed, you may try using a hair dryer if one is available.
The fabric must not be subjected to excessive heating, as it may shrink or catch fire in extreme cases.
There are many ways to purify water, and some of them are more effective at addressing specific hazards.
Depending on the area, boiling water may take a minute or several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, so if you are concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests that are not native to their home areas.
They damage food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, secrete poison, and transmit infections.
In general, the category of pests does not include infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans.
Duty-free shopping offers the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers visiting countries with particularly high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on such items as alcohol and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, the most difficult part for drivers is between Point Marion and Fairmont, often crossing secluded woodlands.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes on the road, for you will often encounter steep inclines, narrow sections and sharp turns.
The speed limits marked are much lower than those applicable to the preceding and following sections (typically 3540 mph, or 5664 km/h), and their strict observance is of the utmost importance.
But the interesting thing is that the cell phone signal is much stronger here than it is on many other parts of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite tasty, and Bavarian pastries are as nutritious and varied as those in Austria, which borders Bavaria to the south.
Fruit cakes are very popular: boiled apples are available all year round, and cherries and plums are available in the summer.
Many German pastries include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and popular cakes often go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but nutritious dish, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dried" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is a common addition to curries, while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
With as many as 17,000 islands, the term Indonesian cuisine encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
The term, without further specification, usually refers to the cuisine typical of central and eastern Java, which is the most important island of the region.
Javanese cuisine, now readily available throughout the archipelago, includes simple spicy dishes, and Javanese favorites include peanuts, chilli peppers, and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off his horse and his foot gets caught in the saddle, the escaping horse may pull him back.
