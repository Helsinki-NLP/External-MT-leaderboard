The Prague Stock Exchange is falling to a minus against the close of business.
After the sharp drop in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions in ČEZ shares accounted for almost half of the normal daily turnover.
The Prague Stock Exchange was closing in on Monday's break as it fell another six percentage points at the start of Tuesday's trading.
This time, the reason for the Wall Street break-in was.
The Czech Republic also reflects the market's reaction to the vote by the US House of Representatives, which refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
The fall in shares in Asia
A dramatic drop occurred on Tuesday in the Asian stock markets, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange lost almost four percentage points during the business day but was later able to make up for some of the losses, reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, while in Shanghai markets were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market fell 3.6% after the index there.
"The timing of the rescue in the United States is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide", said Hong Kong Monetary Authority head Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, determines its own monetary policy, that is, independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as in the United States.
The US legislature should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft support for the financial system, said Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.
Otherwise, other countries could be affected by the break-in.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The US House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which would cost up to $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion Kč).
The legislators ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush believes that the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks were in a bloodbath on Monday, and the major stock indexes recorded their biggest plunge in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell almost seven percent, a similar drop it had seen in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was little indication that the draft would not pass the House of Representatives, the index was experiencing a free fall.
Congress admits the US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance to the US financial system.
The vote on this will take place early next week.
The US legislatures have made a breakthrough in negotiations to approve a bailout plan in the form of a $700 billion financial assistance to the US financial system.
However, this does not mean a victory.
The congressmen must negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the US Congress on Monday.
This was reported by Barney Frank, chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, to Reuters on Sunday.
The Senate could probably vote on the plan as early as Wednesday, according to various reports.
Economists believe that a communication of the plan's adoption should be the first major psychological factor in a financial market recovery.
However, there is a 'spoiling' afterwards because of the complex mechanisms in which markets can be helped in practice.
The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like", said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, to Bloomberg.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
Representatives of the legislature met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
It provides for the purchase of unsold mortgage assets by financial companies, which puts financial firms at a serious loss and endangers the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the verge of reaching a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective in the market.
The plan of recovery has to be continued, but I think we are on our way", Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also strikingly severe in the sharply declining stock markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the legislators are working to reach a final agreement in Congress by Sunday.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the basis of the information provided by the Commission.
But so far it is not clear when both houses of the US Congress will vote on the law, and there is also uncertainty as to whether the last minute negotiations could fail at a problem.
The legislators hope it will be passed in the next few days.
But the law will be subject to some changes.
The total amount to be allocated to the scheme is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars should be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
But Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it feels that the program is not doing its job, with another $100 billion and then the final $350 billion.
Bush is positive about progress in negotiations
The President has the right to veto this decision, but Congress can override its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained, based on obtaining financing to buy bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked it out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress was also welcomed by US President Bush.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and "value the mutual efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restrictions on golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden parachute for directors of the companies involved in the programme and establish a committee to supervise the fund.
This is the Department of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance to homeowners who are having problems repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
I'm not sure.
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And that's because you don't know what mechanism is used to buy the problem assets and at what price.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves", Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or early next week is not decisive in Marek's view.
"It is more important that the members of Congress agree to support the plan and pass it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that a resolution is to be adopted is the most important thing at this moment", Marek stressed.
Duel on the knife cutter: MP3 player against cell phone.
We 'll advise you on your choice
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call yet.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of reasons to choose a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
It's hard to buy a great, expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
But if you have art rock, jazz, or blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
So it's the same with music on the road, that's, compressed music, in simple terms -- music in MP3 format.
Here too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but so will a Pink Floyd fan who is hardly buying headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there's enough room for each.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what cell phones can do, they can't even do intuitively.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the primary functions of calling and simming, it can play music and video, record both, have a better camera, and a worse camera, and maybe even navigate.
And if you include the smartphones and communicators, you've got almost a little computer in your pocket.
It's a little wonder, because no fridge can barbecue and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of cell phones also brings disadvantages.
But the more features you use on your phone, the more you'll have to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy-eaters.
Few phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
So you should expect the cheap phones to be able to play music for no longer than a few hours.
If you do, you may want to buy a charger for your office - even for more expensive appliances.
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, even the less good ones can last at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one charge.
Another problem is when you want to play the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small portion of the devices have a USB port, and not every mobile phone without special software can be connected directly to a PC.
Of course, you can play music directly to a storage medium, but few card readers can handle the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without reducing the amount.
Players do not require any special software except for an iPod.
All you need to do is feed the device to your PC via USB port.
Most phones and players themselves have a music library, sorted by the name of the performer, album title, genre or user rating.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address book, similar to Windows Explorer, some can be both (iver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can be more
When choosing a particular device, you should consider the battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course the comfort of operation.
If you're interested in music, especially behind the scenes, and you listen to it every day for a short time, for example, on the tram, then any phone that plays MP3s is enough.
Which almost any cell phone can do.
You also don't have to control what music formats a cell phone or a player can process.
MP3s are all created, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is among the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also make it possible to buy music online.
You just have to go to the relevant websites of a provider (or another provider) via the mobile Internet and you can buy a song or album.
This service can in itself be a compelling argument for why you should buy a music handset.
Unfortunately, the providers' offerings are poor and are usually limited to fast radio calls.
The prices are not the lowest.
But generally, it is assumed that this type of music sales (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their phones.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the pocket while the player is at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless speaker.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the few MP3 players.
For many, the greatest advantage of music phones will be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three or four thousand crowns, you'll get a decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most people will be that they don't have normal headphones.
The best and most technically advanced phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand kroner.
The advantage of players is the ease of operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - players can really be used by anyone.
A minimum of features, the similarity in operation with the former normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player, is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of a mistakenly set up mobile internet and a subsequent horrific bill for data transfers.
What device should you use now
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an interchangeable storage media slot (M2 type, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns will suffice.
But respect.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can read 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, go to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton, or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB), you do not need to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you're one of the more sophisticated listeners, you'd rather have specialized phones - walkie-talkies (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate MP3 control buttons, which makes the user's comfort more like that of a single MP3 player.
The closest one is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman phones have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually.
The same services in the same price range of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) will provide you with MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe I should .
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, with Czech operators offering virtually all services, as are their Western European partners.
However, there is something missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic to lower prices.
Maybe he won't be waiting long.
We have reported on Mobil.cz many times that the Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by the Telecommunications Authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
The latest steps taken by the European Commission in the field of roaming charges are likely to lead to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices so high in the Czech Republic compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really makes a fight fan.
It may seem paradoxical, as there are three mobile networks in the Czech Republic and a penetration rate of well over 100%.
The mobile operators, on the other hand, like to slander the fact that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
The Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Council Chairman Pavel Dvořák has often contributed to this, having stated in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a great deal of opportunity (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there's another option - a virtual provider.
The introduction of virtual providers into the mobile market in particular led to a significant price decline, to which the traditional mobile operators also had to react.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used to finance the implementation of the programme.
But it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don't have to look for examples for long.
In February we reported on the launch of mobileking in Poland.
In just six months, this provider has managed to attract more than 100,000 customers, making it the fifth largest provider in the country.
Mobilking is backed by the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that they can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a traditional provider.
They do not need relatively high costs to build, operate and maintain a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers are usually seen as low-cost companies - offering cheap phone calls and text messages, but often accompanied by a less extensive service offering.
For example, in the UK, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least half the price of its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good bet to bet on a non-cliché target group.
This provider is specifically targeted at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust", says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept to that in Poland could be implemented in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: 'The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer.'
In the Czech Republic, the mobile operators say, it is unlikely.
But it's almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone provider conquers the Czech Republic, it won't be mobile king.
"While we are talking about expanding this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look particularly hopeful.
It will be more likely that Mobilking will enter the market in other countries of our region", Jana Studničková, press secretary of the Penta financial group, told Mobil.cz.
It confirmed indirectly that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to avoid any potential competitor.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile phone provider has long been expressed by the GTS Novera group, which wants to take a further step towards becoming a real competitor to Telefónica O2 in the business sector.
"We have a strong interest in offering our customers not only fixed network but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in negotiations", said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe better times are coming.
Unofficial information suggests that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far, this has been surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this time we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market is highly specific compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area", Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefónica O2 told Mobil.cz in a statement.
Other providers also point to the specificities of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds, in rare agreement with O2's statement: "So far we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on".
And she adds: "There will be hardly a virtual provider on T-Mobile's network by the end of the year.
We should have a concrete offer at this moment to think in such a short term".
Vodafone is focusing more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický comments: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider the best for our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.'
The responsible authorities - Hand in hand with the suppliers
The behaviour of the mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would be more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profits.
So why should you make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull on a string when it comes to something also proves the long back and forth around the creation of U:fon.
The strongest pressure towards ČTÚ was probably placed on the T-Mobile company when U:fon was launched.
This is also demonstrated by the publicly available information on the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is a good argument for why you shouldn't allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: 'The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile provider.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new actor would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services.'
In view of this approach, however, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately, unlike the UK and other highly developed countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It is the sole proprietorship of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (OPC).
But this was his typical attitude to the whole problem.
'The entry of a virtual mobile operator into the market would be possible only after a contract has been concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual provider for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far no such contract has been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional suppliers,' said Kristián Chalupa of the Foreign Relations Department of the ÚOHS in his reply to our request.
The Commission has not yet taken into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a regulation on the marketing of certain products.
This is more than a matter of concern from an authority that represents the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensures that no one abuses their position in the market.
In particular, Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a country where virtual providers operate normally abroad, their market entry has contributed to a decline in mobile phone prices".
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and the reduction of prices are not likely to be in the interests of the OHIM.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of the programme.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolute price of petrol at the gas stations is certainly a coincidence and the result of a fierce competition.
'The Authority has not found any evidence of anti-competitive conduct in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the providers has a dominant market position and therefore does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their market activities.
The telecommunications regulator is also likely to lack the necessary tools to open up the mobile market to virtual providers,' Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always required for a virtual provider to enter the market.
And the mobile operator has - logically - a monopoly on its network.
This means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if this argument is not accepted, it should at least be a warning to the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are strikingly similar.
A number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) complained that they encountered very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The shifting of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendments to the Telecommunications Act have failed to enforce the extension of ČTÚ's competence to the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS must be well aware of this, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay if no one's looking
The functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, is not taken into account.
They are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but they are only partially public.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for a new directive on the marketing of products.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others offer their own mobile telephone services.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available to select individuals.
The funny thing is, the company is acting like a classic business customer to the operator who orders a lot of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases you describe, then it may be a breach of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which may lead to the termination of cooperation with the relevant company", Martina Kemrová answered our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not be heard among the responsible operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, thousands of customers may be involved.
However, no operator opposes such a procedure.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission is not in a position to take any further steps to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the measures are implemented in a manner that is compatible with the internal market.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: "The law allows for such speculation, and yet only a very small percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot have full access to it as normal mobile phone customers do.'
But that alone would at least be strange to the CTU.
The Commission has also proposed a new proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
The mobile operators are closing their eyes to such an operation, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has fairly strong competence to detect such activities and, if it does not wish to, does not have to satisfy itself with the explanation of the providers that they were unaware of it and that their terms and conditions prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has been emphasised several times in the text, the entry of virtual providers into the market has led to a significant price decline in the various services.
In virtually all countries where virtual providers have emerged, traditional providers have tried to prevent them from emerging in practice.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small or too saturated a market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the developed world, however, it was at this time that regulators intervened, trying to protect the interests of their customers rather than those of mobile operators.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressures, they achieved the creation of the first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech authorities are throwing themselves into the whole case like a hot potato.
In the light of our experience, we cannot escape the impression that in these cases, uncertainty in competence is more than advantageous.
But we're not gonna throw the shotgun into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon be back on track.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the ÚOHS will not be inactive in rejecting (discriminating) further interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not be more expensive to use than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the Best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home country in a celebration hour on the occasion of the day of the Czech statehood.
The anthem was re-recorded by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - male or female solo, choral and instrumental.
The songwriting was done by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server, you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful.
He had already told the Czech radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices who are prominent and popular for the solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear dictionary in both, and then in the choir as well, so that the text would be well understood and harmonized", says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Ständteater in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it on spontaneously.
The first stanza of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What's the "new" anthem sound like?
The Prague transport companies will also be promoting a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will go down in the history of Prague transport companies as the date when the first passengers to board a subway, tram or bus will carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can be purchased by about 100,000 people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and play it simultaneously on their chip card at the information centres and branches of the transport operators at the Museum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka subway stations.
The coupons are also available on the Internet on the transport companies' website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used up to the afternoon hours by over four hundred customers.
Those who use the Internet can really forget the ticket window at the subway stations, where they have had to wait in long lines for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon online, and it's played on the opencard at one of the 13 branches of the city library.
"In these places, travellers also have a trained staff who can advise them on online purchases and also show the coupon on the card", said Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on self-service machines on the opencard, which are installed in some subway vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, remember ticket values, passengers may have noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská subway stations.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year they will be eighty", Opatrný adds.
The coupon is controlled by an automated machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will be operational from tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is enter the chip card, and the coupon you bought before will play itself out.
The electronic coupons will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, which mainly take inhabitants from communities in the Central Bohemian region to the capital.
"On trains belonging to Prague integrated transport, train attendants have readers to check the validity of coupons by time and zone", explains Filip Drápal of the organisation Ropid, which compiles the itineraries for Prague transport operators.
Suburban buses have card readers at the driver's desk.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked spot on the side of the register.
The driver checks the validity of the coupons played.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons played, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information", Drápal said.
A passenger who does not drive suburban buses and no longer knows when the coupon expires may go to the vending machines, where the coupons are played on the card.
The information on the validity of its documents is displayed here on the device's display.
The Sudeten claimed a popular decision from the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest by the United States.
This is stated in a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly addressed the US presidents with such a wish.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the American President in the letter not to allow the return of the "Sudetenengaus" - which was taken from Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure that the American units will enter German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", says a letter signed with the words "People who care about the fate of the Sudeten".
Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia suggests that the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national character - would expect brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to assume, for now and forever, the protective control of the Bohemian Forest.
"We cannot believe that you will accept the views of a quarter of a million people in this region without regard to a state that is foreign to us, which oppresses and tries to eliminate minorities and has done nothing to help the Allies win", the letter reads.
The authors are said to be afraid of the "Czech oppressors' vengeance".
If the US President has any doubts about the attitude of the German in the Boerwald, it is sufficient that he initiate a referendum in the Boerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants want to become part of the USA or live under the protection of the USA.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today's knowledge of postwar history, it does, according to some contemporary witnesses, paint a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Bohemian Germans had at least to guess that they would be negotiated for deportation from the republic, few of them even admitted to such a possibility.
Some were waiting for the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others thought they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was a Budweiser German in the Baltic Sea Navy.
When he was taken prisoner by the British at the end of the war and sent to a prisoner of war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that when they came home, they would learn Czech", says Chalupa.
He believed that none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
If you don't think so, pay!
A campaign of emotion is aimed at drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
The Commission has also proposed a new programme for the development of the European transport network.
The authority of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises to remove dangerous drivers behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million kroner will be broadcast on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
She's supposed to stop the drivers from driving too fast and drinking while driving.
And they also remind you to get dressed before you get on the road.
The campaign aims to raise awareness of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional motorists.
And what's in the spots?
Especially stories of people appealing to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign is proof of this:
If you don't think so, pay!
The words "don't think" are in upper case on a sign.
And then in a bloodshot, the word "pay".
This is supposed to mean paying for a moment of inattention with your life.
The spots will shock audiences by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures of accident victims are normally seen.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take into account the specificities of the measures taken to ensure that the measures taken are implemented in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of the programme.
The spots were compiled by Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whips for drivers
"The motto for the drivers is 'sugar bread and whip'.
Sugar bread means that if you drive on red, for example, you save time.
Whip is then the threat of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk", says Martin Kořán, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why press campaigns and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
He said that signs alerting drivers to danger were even less effective.
"If you put up a static warning sign, it will likely soon flow around and drivers will not notice it", says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
The chairman of the Israeli Provisional Government, Ehud Olmert, has expressed his support for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace can be achieved with Palestine and Syria in return.
He stressed this in an interview published Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) because without it there will be no peace", he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn't want tractors or bulldozers rolling over his legs, as one of my best friends did, will have to forgo a part of Jerusalem", Olmert noted, referring to two attacks in the city in July that killed several people and injured dozens.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple mountains and holy and historic sites" located on the territory of the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work", he continued.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert advocated Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he considered an indispensable condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights", Olmert said.
"The Syrians know all too well what they have to give up to get back to the Golan Heights.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they provide to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the jihad (Holy War) in Iraq", the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
They don't know the law. They're not allowed to walk around on a long-distance bus.
In the context of the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises as to whether stewards and passengers are allowed to walk back and forth on the bus during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activities of a steward are contrary to the road traffic law", said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident that killed a 22-year-old flight attendant last week was probably caused by the driver of the truck that crossed the road with the bus.
The young woman was sitting next to the driver, who was the least secure seat in the car, despite having two more seats available.
But a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply when the steward is holding coffee or newspapers.
The bus is also equipped with parking spaces according to the vehicle licence.
If this is not provided for on the bus, the passengers must sit.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no stops, as the company's director, Radim Jančura, told Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not allow the movement of travellers at first.
This was later withdrawn and we reached a consensus that travellers should be allowed to use the toilet while travelling if they have their seats", he said.
The law doesn 't know a steward .
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legal provision prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only defines the concept of a car companion, but it does not define his rights and obligations", the ministry spokesman Hanzelka adds.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, however, considers that the law will cover this issue subsequently.
"It depends on whether the bus has stops in the product licence.
That's it", he stresses.
Buses are divided into city buses where stops are available and maximum speed is limited, local buses with stops and a higher permitted speed and long-distance buses without stops with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"There are not many dangers in a liquid mode of transport, the situation is similar to the service on board an aircraft.
Here again, it is not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess may bump her head".
"But if you brake a bus sharply, then of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations", he says, adding that this issue is not fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel services
Student Agency is the only bus company to offer services from stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this capacity.
The director doesn't see her profession as risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's job is risky, I'll paint it off.
Coffee and newspapers are available to travelers upon boarding.
This would also reduce costs", he says.
As a safety concern, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards on his buses, but his company operates only a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we've been fighting them since the beginning.
Sooner or later, this will end in some fatal accident", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young flight attendant from the Pilsen region who had worked for the company for two years was injured.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off the lane without flashing and had blocked the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid the bus by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front of the truck.
Jančura denies that the two seats were sold to the stewards.
"These seats cannot be reserved for long distance connections, they are blocked".
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it also expects financial compensation from the perpetrator.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could lead to a legal regulation on which a 30-member expert team from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
'However, no concrete conclusion has yet been reached.
Buses are not necessarily on the agenda, but rather the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones while travelling", says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that could pose a significant threat to the safety of passengers", Hanzelka said, adding that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
The hopes of Düsseldorf are resting on Frankfurt
In a word, the letter from the WestLB Board to the staff of the House is not lacking.
The merger of the Düsseldorf Monetary Institute and Frankfurt-Deka Bank could create "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen Group", the letter said.
WestLB would have introduced a 'competence block' with sustainable profitability into such a business.
In general, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further consolidations in the national banking sector.
That's what happens when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission but also by the Federal Financial Services Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government has just made clear that the time is running out to find a future solution.
The same connection exists between Deka Bank, which is known to savings banks for its investment funds, and WestLB, which has been discussed for some time now, including in Frankfurt.
Although Franz Waas, head of Deka Bank, told the Commission at the end of August that a merger of the house on Mainz Landstraße with a national bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, made no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which is supported by half of the national banks and savings banks, has instructed the Management Board to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The negotiations have, it is said, only just begun.
Deka Bank, which has 3,000 employees and is one of the most important employers in Frankfurt, is not the first time that consolidation in the savings sector has been discussed.
In 2003, for a moment, it seemed that Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
But nothing came of this triad.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessian government objected to Helaba's participation.
The other two houses were also not in tune.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have been repeated speculations about a link between Deka Bank and state banks.
However, Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba's board of directors, had recently spoken out against planning a deal with his house.
Regardless, the recognition seems to be maturing that a decline in the various houses of the public sector is causing a need.
The first step, after the election of the Bavarian parliament, is to link BayernLB to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba, that's not necessarily good news.
If the pressure to merge further increases, the partners will gradually go for it.
In the south, it would be a junior partner, although it has fared better in the financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In a partnership with West LB, the savings and loan association Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85 per cent stake in Helaba, has raised a threshold at the beginning of the year.
At least the North LB stays.
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
The second is the question of how the different business models of each house fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the German savings and loan association had not yet answered the crucial question of which business model should be used to ensure the future viability of the Landesbanks.
The West Bank could also be dismantled, but this is not desirable.
The letter from the local board also states that a "common solution" is being sought for the House.
How this can be achieved by the cooperation of individual units with Deka Bank will be shown.
The second weekend of May is known as the "Italian weekend".
Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the Emperor's five-liter beer jar, stands a massive bearded beard, proving to about 200 Oktoberfest travelers how deep tones can make his throat.
Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova train station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", will depart at 11:45 this evening, arriving at 6:30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved for Italians, and only Brazilians travel on one bus.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing alongside their flag, they've already celebrated at night.
And so loudly, Marco Guarda says, that's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat of pelvic floor food and glasses with wide silver beams, belongs to the buses.
They've been going to the Oktoberfest for five years, three tours alone this year.
Night, day on the Wiesn, back at 10:30.
Marco says that staying overnight would be unnecessary.
The cost of the trip is 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian law of purity, health insurance and the German language guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And the buses roll in the night on the highway to Brennero.
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers sleeping.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
The buses will be stopped in Brixen and wooden churches, where several other buses with Italian signs will also stop on the 8 motorway just outside Munich.
When Marcos's group finally arrived at the planned time of 7.30 a.m. in the early morning at the parking lot near the Theresienweg, the other 50 buses from all over Europe were already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives one last speech, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cap.
The link to the left is "Oktoberfest", in Fractura, and next to it is the internet address of Marcos Travel Agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors to the beer garden open, it means running!" Marco calls in in the morning.
"Run!" run and occupy the back of the tent.
"Not forward, or we'll block, and not spread all yellow caps on the same benches, in the room!"
The measure, Marco cries out, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security people we're good!
As soon as you leave the seats, they're gone!"
Third, "Tonight, get back to the point of 11:30!"
And we're going to Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap is tied to the trees, signs, and even the campaign poster of a major Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be prepared for retreat.
It's the second weekend of May, known as the Italian weekend.
The Commission has not yet published any precise figures, but it is estimated that 50,000 people will be travelling over the Alps and visiting the beer tents.
The Munich police are being reinforced by seven South Tyrol police officers, and Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which maintains a national statistic in which Italians are in first place ahead of the British (about 60 deployments) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical supplies.
The courtyard is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also insinuated that the German banking sector is not spared the crisis.
Because she's coming in this weekend.
The Munich real estate financing firm Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed on the Dax, is receiving a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part it takes.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses at the Depfa daughter.
According to a newspaper report, the state financier had refinanced itself in the extremely short term for long-term projects for which he had lent money - which is no longer possible due to distrust of markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also slightly fallen from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net income from financial transactions decreased by more than 70% to EUR 5 million compared to the previous year, while earnings from credits and certain securities and from the settlement of credit deposits decreased by more than 70%.
Only thanks to higher returns from reimbursement of down payment costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the reimbursement of interest under the tax system and from the management of group companies, the profit margin of around 16% was still moderate.
The former state financier had initially speculated on commercial real estate loans after its privatisation in 1990, which had then been outsourced to Aareal Bank.
Since the traditional state financing was too low, Depfa then became increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of community projects by private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
The value of the subsidiary is now depreciated by Hypo Real Estate, which will have a 'substantial material effect' on the group's profit and loss account, it is said.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
In 2007 it had already been reduced by two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the DEPFA acquisition.
It is more dependent on the interbank market for refinancing than other institutions, as it has no client deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has again largely collapsed as banks are losing their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing for a part of the Depfa's credit portfolio - around EUR 50 billion - annually.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is shielded from the influence of the currently largely inoperative international money markets.
Other sources indicate that the funds have ensured the refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE's Chairman of the Board, Georg Funke, stated that Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to take advantage of the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the market capability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
That is what the bank's shareholders and creditors hope to see.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there seems to be no certainty.
It is not unthinkable that the financing must not be used in full.
But the opposite is not to be excluded.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to proceed with the financing of the Bank.
The stock price is down 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are maintained.
If the primary debt is hardly moving, the rates of the secondary debt are more pronounced.
The main concerns are the bonds of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009.
Although the hypothesis of the real estate sector is that it is a speculative investment alternative, its value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system, following the sharp escalation of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which only took over the crisis with the acquisition of DEPFA.
As long as central banks, governments and less-favoured commercial banks are willing to support the system, it can be assumed that the pension will be paid on time.
Or it happens that which hardly anyone at the moment dares hope for -- that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
But given the reports that overlap with partial nationalization, the probability of security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This should prepare long-term creditors for some sleepless nights when deciding whether to break off their commitments.
Short-term investors can use a closing line to draw up a loss statement for future tax payments on later years' earnings.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is scheduled to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to giggle: "The German is a total Kawaii!"
What's that supposed to mean?
Sylvana knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"First day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had a little bumpy before school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, heading for Kawasaki, and I'm 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, thankfully I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the lesson does not seem to be as strictly set at Tachibana as it is at our home in Lower Saxony.
Students enter the classroom from 8:00 until the beginning of a brief session with the teacher, the 'home room', at twenty-nine.
But before class began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to talk to people, not even in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my hostess, including blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator, I stood in front of the desk and tried to say everything right: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana"... - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and I have a birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class were all shaking, cheering and waving, and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii".
I knew that from my manga.
It's a very important word in Japanese girls' vocabulary and means "low, sweet".
Then I quickly got in my seat.
The girl next to me laughed quite broadly, and she felt honored that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really taken in.
Everyone was talking and kicking and asking me to get a hole in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, they packed all their bentos.
My hostess had also made me a lunch box like this - it's something other than the boring German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, pickle salad and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofu jacket.
I don't usually have a pale glow, which is exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It's always been said that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, maybe, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a homemade Bento, which she then makes especially artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy better at a break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch this too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
"Because I'm fascinated by it".
After all, I've been reading my favorite manga for years.
And to understand the comics and the culture in them better, I also started learning a little Japanese at some point.
So it was perfectly clear to me that I would have to travel here at some point.
Because I have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen".
Rats have feelings too
Does a rat or a squirrel run away when it's in danger, so it's afraid?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings too.
How can you tell if they feel the same way if they're behaving like us?
For several years now, the online magazine Edge has been publishing contributions by renowned scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a series of selected answers to the question "What do you believe to be true without proof?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, but I or anyone else has not been able to prove that until now, where we can't even prove that other humans have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But once we turn to another species and we cut through questions of sensation or consciousness in general, we're entering a dead end because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it pretends to be dead, runs away, or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, which some scientists conclude is a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely absent from other creatures.
So at least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there's reason to believe that humans are even different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature is likely to be the linguistic nature of man: Since so much of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, you could rule out animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, however it may be acquired, is likely very different from most of our states of consciousness.
So it's hard to tell what consciousness might look like in other animals.
If it is something internal and subjective that cannot be measured or analyzed by our own experience because of the specific hardware, then its research presents us with great problems.
Most of my statements relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible to science.
You could study the processes of consciousness in animals regardless of their contents, and that's exactly what happens in studies of primate short-term memory, especially with the example of visualization.
But this approach, which was followed by Christoph Koch and Francis Crick, relies more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: they may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What is the result of these feelings?
I'm tracing it back to the fact that an emotional system like fear is activated in a conscious brain of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state we find ourselves in when the activity of the brain's localized defense system (or its consequences, like physical reactions) is evidence of working memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates, and especially humans.
In connection with the nature of language, fine degrees of sensation arise because we can use words and grammar to differentiate and categorize states to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that sensations from more primitive activities in the body sensation regions of the cortex and brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much over the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in intergenic sensations.
I cannot, in theory, dispute this, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to feel this way in both cases: But how can you verify that rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A frog flies when in danger, even if it feels fear?
In my view, mere similarity of behavior cannot yet prove equality of experience.
The neural comparison is still helpful: rats and humans have similar brain stem, but crabs don't even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it to humans, how would you prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even frogs (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'd rather study emotional behavior than rat emotional sensations.
At any rate, progress is gaining momentum at the neural level if you measure the same in rats and humans.
As I don't study language and consciousness in rats, neither do I study sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You may think this is shortsighted, but I'd rather move forward than keep running against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: time limit for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a testament to Ukraine's confidence and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland", said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is much to be done in both countries".
The two hosts are lagging behind in the timetable for the construction or renovation of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible that the number of EM stages will even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at the highest speed", said the President of the Ukrainian Federation, Grigory Surkis.
"UFA will keep an eye on us all the time".
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Minister for Sport Miroslav Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious risk that PZPN will not be able to follow the rules", Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer".
Several first-team players were sentenced to forced demise for manipulation last season alone, and even the league started to be postponed for a short time.
Enraged Dennis Quaid is backing down
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke privately in interviews, and now she's in trouble with her ex-Hollywood star Meg Ryan outing her ex-husband Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
He's a foam-headed man, and he's hitting back.
Late Rose War with ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an unpleasant fight with each other - in public.
Meg Ryan first explained the reasons for the breakdown in an interview with InStyle last week: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it has been very painful".
She only learned the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press release for her new film "The Women" - the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his departure as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It is awful", the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, "that Meg is repeatedly reliving and re-denoting the history of our relationship".
It is also "sad" that their 16-year-old son, Jack, is once again "reported publicly about the pain and upheavals that divorce means for every child".
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently fathered twins.
And he concludes his introductions with the side-slip: "My life goes on anyway.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that is doing well".
Decline in airline and hotel prices
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights have even become 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and hotel accommodations have become cheaper again, according to a study by travel and financial services company American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant decline in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices in the hotel market, overnight stays have already become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were already 3.6% lower than last year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the weak dollar rate as the cause of this, which has led to a "declining travel appetite among American tourists".
The fall in hotel prices also affected financial centres such as Frankfurt and London more than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices have even set a European record, rising by 26.3 percent.
The trend in air fares in the first quarter also showed an upward trend:
Due to the increase in the amount of kerosene, economy-class travelers paid an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy-class tickets fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first-class tickets, the price changes were much lower.
In Germany prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they had fallen 23.6 percent.
The study shows that prices on domestic flights in Germany have even halved.
The company explains that the reason for the price decline was on the one hand the slowdown in economic growth.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has been declining.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe, has increased competition pressure.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific measure to prevent the airline from operating in the same way as the airline.
HSV is beating Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV will be the leader of the table.
With Borussia, Luhukay still can't find a working elf.
Christopher Klein is making a big impact on national player Marko Marin.
The ice-cream player didn't come in until late and failed to hit the lathe with a lever.
His message was well worded, convincingly passed over his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second gate", whispered Hermann Rieger in the hallway of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not done in the catacombs, the half-hour break was over, and most were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist at HSV for almost three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than some fluid actors.
And so his request was heard in a responsible position.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and agreed to raise his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have sounded similar: Go with gate two!
The implementation was not completed.
"There was not everything beautiful to see today", Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have "desired more relaxed".
The 1:0 (1:0) is due to the headball hit by Mladen Petric (11).
"It was a dirty victory", Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburg SV turns 121 this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flashboard on the video wall that identified their club as classroom premier.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify this", said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the table-setting evidence is more about the unpredictability of the league than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late-committed approaches - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the FC Bayern recruited Jansen - is slow to find its way, but it cannot yet shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbling", Jol demanded.
After the vote was defeated
Wall Street is a place of fear.
Initial reports of the bailout's failure caused the Dow Jones to temporarily fall by 700 points.
That was the biggest one-day point loss in his history.
Later, the Dow caught something.
At about 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer recorded 10,579 counters, down by about five percent.
The technology exchange Nasdaq was down more than seven percent at 1,548 points.
The biggest loser at that time was the Dow American Express, which fell by almost 14 percent and the Bank of America, which lost about 12 percent.
No title could be won.
The shares of Goldman Sachs fell almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, big investor Warren Buffett took a stake in the company.
The rescue plan will provide funds for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage securities.
The Commission has already decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used to finance the budget.
In return, the State should receive the financial companies' share options notes, which could be redeemed if the price developments were appropriate, in order to reduce the burden on the State Treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA are downward
The billions of dollars in aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not solve the investor's doubts.
The stock price of the German superbank Hypo Real Estate is falling and the tax is being torn down.
The US Dow Jones Index is losing despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have caused the German stock index (DAX) to drop to a low.
The Munich real estate investor's shares temporarily lost three quarters of their value despite the bailout action by the federal government and private banks, while Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped clear below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark, scoring a minus 3.7 percent on 5,839 points.
Worldwide, the stock market was on its knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to boost financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points in the first trading hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives was voting on the bailout plan, which could be followed by a vote in the Senate on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially dropped 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris fell 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after earnings.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index dropped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90.
In India, the leading index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 counters.
In MDax, shares of Arcandor were divested after the announcement of a capital increase.
The Sal. Oppenheim private bank has signed the 23 million new shares.
The trading and tourism group also announced that the shares would not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences spacecraft flight
For years, research has been troubled by a mysterious phenomenon: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by-manoeuvres.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the spacecraft Ulysses flew through space.
Because of the soon-to-be-frozen fuel lines, you are now threatened with cold death.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon - the swing-by-anomaly.
Swing-by is a spacecraft flight maneuver in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
This will save the probes a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as did the Ulysses solar probe.
What has amazed researchers for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect under the ancient law of gravitation.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are suddenly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the gravitational pull of matter through a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes Einstein was not wrong, and he tries to explain the swing-by-anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made in the universe.
"It could be dark matter that is responsible for the anomaly, which could be very close to Earth", he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about a decade.
It obviously has an attractive force that can be observed on other celestial bodies.
It is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, dark matter is at least one-fifth the mass of the universe.
Egypt's abducted tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists who were taken to Egypt are to be released again, as the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six hostages were reportedly killed in a shoot-out before release.
In southern Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Time and again, Germans are being targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE reports the most important cases.
The European tourists who have been dragged into the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabiya and Italian media in agreement.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports by Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently checking her health", Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions were safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are said to be already en route to Cairo.
The background to the shootings before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the abduction before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom", the official said.
It was "only to receive the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom reported, citing a German mediator, that the hostages' release was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers plan to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse by the Stepfather "led to Suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman committing suicide, a court report said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to eight counts of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death".
The court found that Mrs Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, aged 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise had tied her and blindfolded her before he engaged in sexual acts while her mother was away working in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Ms Randle, who volunteered for the National Trust for much of her time, was being persecuted for abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a keen surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "abandoned her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
It is believed that she committed suicide by choking herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with: "I used to tie her and bind her eyes".
"I didn't sexually coerce her.
I feel responsible for her death".
Judge Christopher Elwen said of Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been terrifying for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still, it is highly unlikely that the case would have ended in court had she not done so".
He added: "I take note of the impact, as Stephanie's father and mother describe, her actions over the years on her daughter.
Otherwise she would have been a promising, successful, and happy young woman".
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official who lost top-secret documents on a train in June will be charged under the Public Safety Act.
The man was deployed by the Department of Defense when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It's the weakest charge under the law, and there's no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought it would be dealt with internally at the Department of Defense and Cabinet".
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor's Office recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he published included classified assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a secret location.
Housing companies look at B&B costs
British housing companies could face a cost of more than £80 million after rescuing Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Associations (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "intolerable" that the companies and their members should pay.
The 14 billion loan will be paid back when Bradford & Bingley's loans are paid off.
But the interest accrued in the meantime is charged each year to the 700 financial firms that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have been prudent... are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
I'm not sure.
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies must raise £81 million for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, the director general of the Housing Association, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions which acted prudently during the real estate boom are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions which were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since records were set in 1945.
"We will be monitoring all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives are available to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs".
The interest rates due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
As construction companies are mutual organizations without partners, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk is getting five pence a liter more expensive
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consultancy.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Bangladesh Prime Minister denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defendants said the court denied bail on the charge of blackmailing a businessman for 50 million taka ($729,700) while she was prime minister.
This case is one of several pending corruption charges against her.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government first grant her unrestricted freedom.
The correspondents say that although she was granted a suspended sentence to go abroad for medical treatment, it is unclear as to whether she will be able to remain free on her release when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.
"The High Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail application because it says she does not need to be granted bail as she is already on probation abroad to be treated abroad", said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will lodge a legal complaint against the High Court".
Her lawyers are asking that she need bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami Alliance party chairman said on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the charges against them.
Fears about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest polio campaign in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have been left unvaccinated due to violence linked to the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations has launched a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of workers who are doing the vaccinations.
BskyB loses the lawsuit in ITV
BskyB lost its action against the competition commission's decision to reduce its stake in competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously argued that BskyB's share distorts competition and allows it to exert unfair influence over ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the stake in ITV by BskyB raised doubts about ITV's independence, which prompted the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom communications office have all spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its stake in ITV was unreasonable and excessive, in particular because BskyB had announced that it would relinquish its voting rights.
New investigation in the US US Attorney's office
The U.S. Attorney General has assigned a special investigator to handle the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, which criticized the actions of the administrative staff.
The report drew criticism from White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that the lawyers had been fired for political reasons.
Special Investigator Nora Dannehy is now to investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators to obstruct justice.
Serious allegations, including criminal activity, have not been fully investigated or resolved, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appeal of a special investigator with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Justice Department removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors were being dismissed for poor performance.
However, it was later found that the fired prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the resignations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of senior Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate allegations of election fraud by Democrats.
U.S. U.S. Attorneys are charged with investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was fired for the firings and eventually resigned.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The inspector general's report criticized Gonzales' role, saying he was "in charge" of the dismissals, "abandoned" his leadership role and "extremely disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for their lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Award for Music for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special gold award next week in London during the ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which runs for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's 1977 album Hital.
Coldplay is leading the nominations for this year's awards after being shortlisted in four categories.
Q Magazine editor-in-chief Paul Rees said there were some songs that went beyond such things as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song that was written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice provided by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, including an operation in 2003 for an irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute throat infection.
Later, it was revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon sold
New York City has thousands of major roads, avenues, side streets, and other byways, some famous and others convenient.
Yet even experienced taxi drivers and longtime locals find it difficult to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is in the East Village and runs from First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used bypass.
There's no street signs.
It's practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This road has its admirers, though.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to refurbish Extra Place to create a clean passageway to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the longtime neighborhood, who says she's fascinated by the short alley, simply because it's one of the remnants of the block's past.
But the city administration department responsible for the protection and repair of the residential buildings and the road has no interest in maintaining them.
At a meeting of the town council's land use committee this month, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the road to be bought by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the county commissioner at City Council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city", she said.
"There may be offers to repair and operate the road, which Avalon could do, but we also want to ensure public access".
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street would be refurbished and seating would be provided, including for a café the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the road, but it didn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decaying alley and make it a public meeting place", she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the building protection department, said that the city's desire was actually to sell the street and stressed that the department's job was to develop rather than manage the properties.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical appeal.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802 when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by no one.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock memorial, which closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is probably best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was filled with debris, lumber and pieces of jars, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity  a virtually unchanged part of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgia Look at the Dying City"), published a section of the talk of the city's history about Extra Place in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
Author Brendan Gill wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac that remains dark even during the day and is marked by rusty metal doors in the warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past rain gutters".
With few exceptions, this is what the street looked like one night.
A rat ran through the back of the road, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where a more expensive clothing store is located today.
Graffiti was visible on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road be polished a little.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, wet, and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: education in an English-speaking environment
In this issue of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior fellow in California Studies and senior director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choices".
Addressing the Hispanic electorate is a complicated task.
The education proposals of Barack Obama are a typical example of this.
Obama's campaign mentions that "the odds of African-American and Hispanic students graduating are lower than those of white students" - which is true.
To close this gap, Obama's education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition phase in education for those who are just learning English.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, conflicts with his interest in reducing school distances.
Take Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in East Los Angeles.
The majority of the students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the pupils, many of whom are newly arrived in the country, are learning English.
Yet in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent of fourth-graders passed the state math test at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of fourth-year students were rated good on the English test.
This amazing success has been achieved by methods other than those favored by Obama.
Sixth Street School places its emphasis on review and practice, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
The school also practices the approach to education in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly what Obama should be aware of, according to school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of the English language in vocational education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me that the school had had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico.
"It works", she remarked, "it works for us".
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large percentage of Latin American and other English-language learners?
The school's performance would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national education associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about legislation that is "English only".
Instead, he said, "You have to make sure your child can speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to close the gap, he should carefully consider models of education that work, rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall as a result of renewed economic fears
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, due to fears that even the American bailout plan for financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
The New York Stock Exchange's crude oil sales fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and the powerful whirlwinds in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices have fallen to nearly $90 a barrel this month before rising again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, investors were again concerned, even though congressional representatives announced they had agreed on a rescue plan over the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the final chapter of the growing crisis, Citigroup is expected to acquire the banking business of Wachovia Corporation, according to a government statement on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a bailout, it appears that the mood in the markets has not been restored.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a statement to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become highly uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the commodity markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the commodity markets, we are most concerned about whether the US-American virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China".
The Bank's analysts have lowered their oil consumption expectations for the coming year due to weak economic growth and lowered their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
I mean, I mean, I think I've seen it all, right? I think I've seen it all, right?
Then he saw the second quarter on Sunday, where the Jets turned a losing game into a triumphal draw.
"I've never seen anything like this", Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
But when quarterback Brett Favre's pass came to Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon where their evolving collaboration took a giant leap forward.
Favre found Coles in that quarter for two more touchdowns, one of which came off the bench as a defensive end and the other 10 seconds before halftime.
"I didn't make much of an effort", says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote voted, no matter what people think".
While Favre and Cole were playing catch, the defense cut quarterback Kurt Warner off.
Outsider Darrelle Revis caught an unintentional throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came across another passport and grabbed it.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused Warner to lose.
The last ball loss forced on Bowens was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20-yard shot to a 34-0 lead.
That was the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the Jets' coach, replied, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answer, because the Jets gave up 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single point, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time".
Rested breastfeeding breaks his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has again shown why some consider him the best long-distance runner of all time, having broken his own record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first person to complete the 42.2-kilometer distance in less than two hours and four minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year.
Gebrselassie, 35, has set his 26th world record in his multi-sport career, having won at least one world title or set a world record at every mile from the mile to the marathon.
Last month, Brbrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympics marathon, fearing that air pollution might worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - sun and 9 degrees at start and 13 degrees at finish - the speed of the race was 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched to long distance running, the record time for a marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with a result of 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had a cramp in his vagina two weeks ago and could not train for a week.
Apparently, he came back fresh after a break and not roasted.
"I'm so happy", he told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end it was all great".
He has been criticized - particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia's rival from East Africa - for over-orchestrating his races, avoiding many of the world's top marathon stars in general, relying too much on the runners as if it were a train race, and setting world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly affects the size of breast implants as long distance runners.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the track in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge breastfeeding after the timekeepers had given up.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final appearance to separate from Kwambai, who came in second in 2:05:36, improving his best time by almost five minutes.
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48.
Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now from Germany, completed a remarkable year in women's events by setting the record for the seventh fastest time ever at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff of Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as back injuries, but recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She had her run planned by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners first scratched, but then overcame after 30 kilometers.
Askalefa Magarsa from Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kipro from Kenya came third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardship of the black people's lives in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the outcrops of the Orlando-area amusement parks, a few miles from the glittering, noisy, gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet city that reveals the pride and complications of African-American culture.
Eatonville, the first all-black town in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935. "The city with 5 lakes, three cricket grounds, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison".
Today it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city it describes and made a tourist destination by including it in the Florida Travel Guide, produced by the Federal Writers Project during the Depression, is and remains in many ways a place of a very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, as fit, and as private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what's missing".
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open discussion about race relations, many here continue to get tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We're very careful about how our story is told", says Hortense Jones, 59, a native of the city and a member of the city's oldest church.
It has to be true".
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It's both a historic example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 residents where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a fortress of literature on the one hand and an example of the sometimes condemned, sometimes praised black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
It's no surprise that the people here are both proud and cautious.
And so, the concern about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in oral style, such as Mules and Men (1953) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel guide changed the city, located very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, into the scene of black history and human drama.
Like Oscar in both real life and literature, Hurston Reader led to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"To the left of the road", she wrote, "is the brown-white-painted modern school, with its well-groomed gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always tends, though he can barely read or write".
She also mentioned the new man from Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever-ever fits classrooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was definitely not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were", says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston, quoting men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added: "Some people didn't like this".
Hurtson is still remembered here as a vibrant eccentric who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came to town with a broom, she did so mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that even today picks up a bit of her respectable dress style.
Mr. Franklin said most residents were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora", said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long", he added as he rocked his chair on a back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were stolen.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary of Langstin Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
There was no grand memorial service in Eatonville, no large-scale public reading.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy in the slightest", says Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
The turning point came in the '80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to build a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's slow two-lane main road.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western suburbs.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial segregation brought hatred into the community.
"In that time a bunch of white boys often came and threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away", said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed in the process.
They threw a watermelon out of the car".
In 1955, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand to force integration in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, calling its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "offensive rather than respectful of my race".
Residents today say that while the end of segregation was in some ways positive, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged their teacher in the morning and they hugged their teacher in the evening", said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group for protecting the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for as long as teachers and students could no longer come from the same place, she added.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap", said Mrs Nathiri.
However, civil rights have helped to make room for more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors, and artists who have moved beyond prejudice, as she did, with positive self-esteem and statements like, "How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand that".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out to Hurston's unnamed grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much-lauded Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found on bookshelves, and once again made it part of the American literary canon.
The long-distance project came at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a lifesaver.
The community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the freeway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many return every January for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans for a five-lane highway were a major source of excitement for the city, speeding up the process at a high speed, and creating real citizens' pride", said Mrs Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd put it a little more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the long-distance project has helped change the city's self-image.
More and more train travelers came, as did Rachel Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special place in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She's 90 percent black these days.)
Outsiders seeking the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
Most interviews require prior permission and certain things - such as the mural of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in the field - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, confident teacher with a fondness for dark red, still fear that their sheltered community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew, a higher degree of homeland pride was born.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, no worse or better, and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed up as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the city government or the police, who he says may need some help.
And even younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just drive through here will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Alondra Kenon said one Sunday after church.
"But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city".
We in New York speak fluent financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't even realize they were in the middle of a debacle.
You'd never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-shaped offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York City are having the worst horror workday ever since the stock market crash of 1929.
Suppliers are still clamoring for metal tearooms along sidewalks and carrying tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still sneak around apartments, like human pack animals loaded with the 50 twisted T-shirts hanging from a yoke-like pole on their shoulders.
Office employees still wait for their breakfast at the food stalls on the sidewalks, and it's still impossible to get a yellow taxi on weekdays between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, because of all the world's end rumours, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to put my duty on time in the quiet late afternoon at my JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not at the cash registers to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, tourists ask about the way to Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most of my predecessors, I learned later from Starr, my "personal licensed bank employee", were for the same reason as I was.
But unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, from places they commuted from, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrift stores (a bit like a construction savings fund), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, saying they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went out of business quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank, went into bankruptcy and as New Yorkers drove home over the weekend last Friday, Wachovia, another bank with $440 billion in savings, was looking for a saviour buyer.
Fearing another crash, the office and store employees who stood before me took their money to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank that is responsible for most of the rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have been getting a little bit of a financial Latin lathe in the last few weeks.
A woman who called my Chinese tribal supermarket was so familiar with Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and their sluggish-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if to mock a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has moved away from our usual conversation topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I have all my savings in money market funds now", she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any more risks".
Muslim graves violated during right-wing slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to represent the organisation Cities Against Islamization.
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs depicting a mosque, dotted with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, where far-right parties have made significant gains in the country's parliamentary elections that weekend.
On the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Graveyard in Traun near Linz in an action organized by police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to cover up the motives of the Muslim immigrant-hatred-driven extremists.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way connected to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration of the tomb that took place as the Muslim religious month of Ramadan was nearing its end.
At the same time, a round of conscientious objection research is underway in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that won almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their votes were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18 percent of the vote, supported a ban on headscarves and burkas, even expressing his dislike of foods commonly associated with Islam.
At his last demonstration in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets on the grounds that these are political symbols of the continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted immediately after the election, which say the far right is the most politically powerful bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, was banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Judges suspended Glitter for six months after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police were granted a travel ban last Thursday after presenting evidence to the judges for Glitter's child sexual abuse charges.
Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford County Court hearing in Kent but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court reported: "On Thursday 25 September Kent Police asked Ashford County Court for permission to prevent Mr Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not present in person".
According to the sex offender registry, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police seven days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of up to five years.
Kent police said they wouldn't discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible location in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent Police said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad".
"We believe it is easier to control someone in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks".
"The primary concern of the Kent Police is to protect the residents of Kent and we are working closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk to the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong after a while.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted he return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for permission to request that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been jailed for four months in the UK in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter has been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
I'll meet the master behind the stage to capture his character, Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no rubs, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and devote themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into my private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find the typical gesture of personality, the depth of a stolen look or the expression of the hands that are worried about not entering the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents alternating theatrical staging of some stages on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco depiction at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing day by day", explains the artist, making it clear that flamenco people can be anyone, but when looking at the photos, the viewer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
The ordinary people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
Their personality and character is in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to use the camera to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco master.
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', embarked on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
The camera's image sorting function and the material available have created images that resemble classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical foundation of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea, as the farmer understands Flamenco: `Music with traditional roots, which changes and surprises every day'.
It is not just the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the artist's personality, his character, that seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for something that becomes visible through hearing, by being, is and has been the definite goal of this work, which will be presented in the future in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Celebrity figures in flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others, are among the close selection of nearly seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project has become an anthology of the Flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to re-engage in this idea two years ago and to make it a reality as 'SportARTproject' (')
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me a great deal of pleasure in photographing people, getting to know them and putting myself in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a long time.
I think in the field of photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or run into people, personalities that you sometimes don't even know, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.'
The collection of portraits of the Flamenco of today, entitled `Flamenco-people', is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located on the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to la Alameda de Hércules.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he's writing is a total jerk.
He doesn't know where the novel takes place or what it's about yet, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying hard to move forward with the project he's working on, a novel featuring the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon.
Yesterday, during his attendance at the Hay Festival Segovia, the Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project he is working on is a "crazy" and "all indications are that he shouldn't have to write the novel".
If I had been prudent, I wouldn't have done it, but I will, and I hope to finish the novel at some point', so he ended his participation in the festival, where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding figures at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, the Hay Festival award winner and the voice of the majority of the audience, is compared to the old version of `Our mutual friend' and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had an audience in front of him who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose from an extraordinary desire for adventure, from a love of reading and from wanting to experience more than before; how he writes and displays discipline to supplement his lack of inspiration, his intense work with documentaries, numerous corrections and revisions he makes; how his works, such as Faulkner, Hugo and Alejandro Dumas, influence his experiences and the basis for his 'Gae's' fiction.
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that there is no way to measure and how to know whether books change lives, but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it 'creates effects' and 'divides people even more', so I asked the writers not to give up on ease and 'take responsibility for his vocation' `.
At the party in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play a part.
After the announced bullfighters determined that the floor of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting event to conclude the Pozoblanco festival was postponed to yesterday morning.
The organisers, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfight.
The festival was therefore suspended because of the incessant weather, and two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second bullfight could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a party on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed after leaving the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante hit two horns and an ear of bull, which he had achieved more by galloping than by his bullfighting skills.
And worse, El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he fought so badly, most of the audience reacted to his second fight with boo-cries.
In Álava, two people tried to escape control of their car, which was loaded with 2,000 kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow, five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the municipality of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers urged the drivers of the car to stop, after which they fled.
It seemed that they would not have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
Police chased them and arrested one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A.A.J., the Basque Ministry of the Interior reported.
The arrested person was charged with drug trafficking and forging official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the traffic police of the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and were driving past the town of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to check the route, but the driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to evade the control.
The police began the pursuit until the car stopped a few miles from the edge of the strip, at which point the drivers got out of the car to flee across a country road to a forested area.
The police of Ertzaintza finally caught one of the two, and in the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers were transporting 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was seized by the police.
The front of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later sent to other police stations for precise laboratory analysis and weighing.
The officials also found that the licence plate was `duplicated', so that it did not match the licence plate indicated in the vehicle documents, which led to an additional arrest for falsification of official documents.
The police of Ertzaintza continue their investigation to arrest the second suspect, who, as mentioned, managed to escape, and to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A.A.J. was taken to a police station for questioning and will be brought before the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, best known for her role as Amanda in the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness witness watched her attempt to get out of her parking lot in Montecito in a rather strange way, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told `People magazine.
The witness detailed that Locklear was squeezing gas pedals and making a lot of noise after 4:30 p.m. trying to move her car back or forward from the parking lot, and as she was driving backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.
A little later, the witness, who probably didn't realize the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby road and get out of the car.
The witness was the one who notified the emergency department because she was afraid of living for Locklears.
When the police arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was across the street, blocking traffic.
She seemed to be unoriented, so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol centre to test her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative, excessive alcohol use was ruled out from the start.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and was taken to a local detention center at approximately 7:00 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from a hospital in Arizona after being treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left takes responsibility for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the VL's chief coordinator and United Left MP, today assured that the regional association for education will be the one to decide the case of former Seville City Council's youth and sports councillor, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
In such cases, I am a great federalist and the Andalusian organisation will be the one to take responsibility for this', Llamazares pointed out, pointing out the attitude the party must take towards the one who has been serving as a city councillor in Seville's municipal council.
Nevertheless, the VL Chairman defended the need for transparency in the possible investigations into the infringements Silva may have initiated:
In this regard, he stressed that education has a strict code of ethics for all public offices.
`Sangre de mayo': the heroic book by Garci
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's `Episodios Nacionales', José Luis Carci presents in `Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to present a range of personalities and social analysis, which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained at the beginning of a long list of actors at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
`Sangre de mayo' is a two and a half hour long film that will be shown in cinemas on Friday and later on Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a big fan of Galdós's literature, assures that thanks to this filmmaking, his ` childhood dream was fulfilled. This is due to Esperanza Aguirre, who was commissioned three years ago by the Autonomous Community of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the celebration of the second century on 2 November in Madrid.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid to the filmmaking process, Garci said, offers the unique opportunity to present, by means of decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of a confused Spain which chose the wrong leader for the struggle because the people had been left behind by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII.'
However, the filmmaker regrets that the financing of `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as `Sangre de mayo') could not be expected, so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in `Volver a empezar', contributed by his usual way of working: he set himself up on stage to be one of the actors with whom one must first rehearse before starting to shoot and to those who had not cast him, he appeared humiliating and respectful, part of the job of a film director is to help in the theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the film industry in which one works.'
Many actors he encounters in `Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar nominee in four nominations (one of which he won), believes and assures that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmography.
Garci doesn't expect any awards for this movie.
'You think you're working for the offspring at first, you realize it's just for the good, and now you're happy that you've made another movie,' explains Garci after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who was also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: Her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert on oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first women to fight for the emancipation of women, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and she advocated the abolition of corsets, which restricted free women's movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the interwar period, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role, which I thought was impossible.'
`We are not trying to tell about her life without preserving her spirit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance skills have helped me a lot in flamenco.
I thought the butterfly dance was like Guajira, or the snake dance like tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area,' she claims.
The production is expected to have two exceptional collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel again at one of her performances, as he did in `La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her former students.
Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature character.
I am happy that she agreed to help me, and I feel very honored.'
The production also includes musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with vocals by Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with percussion by El Pájaro, as well as the viola by Rafa el Viola and collaboration with actor Juanfra Júarez, he `s taking on the role of the accompanist of the artists who were Divas, in whom he falls in love again and again.'
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
`I wanted to remember her, because I think she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a particular era and whose work is no longer appreciated and therefore even less appreciated today', says Bayón.
The performance will take place at 8:30 p.m. today at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' at Saint Stephen's Church, New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides the appropriate atmosphere for planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008).
Thus, the ` ` the triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' concludes with the new edition of this work, the international congress taking place in New York, the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and the traveling exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which opened in May and, after being in different places in Andalusia, now reaches New York and is presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received 800 copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso.
The United States can't imagine itself without Paul Newman.
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him on 'Sensation Reporter', and the then-dominant US cinema concept, which was abandoned, from all over America to Newman coming up with his exciting idea and following it.
Look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, it was a big blow for everyone.
What one feels sometimes is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' Robert Redford said crying, 'my life and my country were the greatest tricks of his life.'
No one was afraid to make a fool of themselves or exaggerate.
As the father of cinema and the fatherland, he died at a sad moment of terrorism and market crash, when the American people's low self-esteem is desperately searching for reasons to regain dignity.
If in this difficult time, there are few people without virtue to admire, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered a number of losses and gains, from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs, founded in honor of his first-born son who died of an overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift to the country where he has had to work hard to fight against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of wonder is blowing up Hollywood regardless of nationality and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the entire era.
Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said working with Newman was no more or less the pinnacle of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'The greatest of us all has left us,' George Clooney confirmed, perhaps one of the few today who are trying to live as Paul Newman lived: to have high standards of integrity, to live a responsible private life, away from the cameras.
It's not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone trying to, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years afterwards, to whom he was faithful, although there were certainly many chances of not being.
`Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have a filet at home?' he often joked himself.
In heaven, he will be proud that on earth his daughters share the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily the norm in America.
`Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as his faithful spouse, loving father, caring grandfather and philanthropist,' they say.
The streets in Madrid are inadequate for the Olympics.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic Games in Madrid, after the failure of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we prepared for this?
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
It was called the perfect street, and in my opinion, it was the worst street with everything going on.
Of course, that's a lot of nonsense, if you were to consider the evaluation and I could check it out, that clearly wouldn't have worked.
But let's go through everything from the beginning.
The crap starts with the ticket office, which allows you to be the first to leave.
It doesn't seem bad to me, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams on the road).
I mean, not at all.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first nonsense is to go there just for that) and (after an infinite queue) there's the surprise!
Where do we live?
Or was it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
Well, things like this are a small thing compared to the days on the street.
Aside from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there's already a 15-minute queue and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Eventually, as expected, the road began and we had not left our backpacks behind, even if we had once succeeded, but it would have been harder to get them back.
Moreover, during this 40-minute wait it looked like rain, which led to the temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow, I'm sure some 500 people will have pneumonia and some like me will not even show up in time for the classification because of this chip I got, I can already imagine that the output was wrongly stamped.
Of course, if you were to ask me what a perfect road is, I would never think of this road.
So I think we're going to be dreaming for a long time about a city that's well prepared for the Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the advances of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a type of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or, in Microsoft's case, a route planner to get around the company's campus).
Thanks to a camera and a shape and facial recognition system, this receptionist can see how many people are in the room, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, she can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also arrange those present after the talks into groups.
In the presentation video, the receptionist notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group with whom she is having a conversation and is not an employee of the company.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and says she'll be listening soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is definitely the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, like the next version of their Windows operating system.
This week, there was a very superficial talk about Microsoft's change in strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have as many programs embedded.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the most basic equipment, instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added some functionality and extras to Windows versions.
The change in direction is worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system is losing its importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome came online, it was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many people were quick to point out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work simultaneously.
The operating system performs a function comparable to that of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right, I'm not.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his `de' not as an absolute but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of that idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, and more attention to the web browser.
The computer is just starting to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day we spend more time surfing than we do around the windows.
What is half the applications in the computer for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 has to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
It's easier, not too much, not too complicated.
Microsoft's main interest is to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In fact, they need it, no doubt.
I took this photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees earlier this month.
The soft drink machine has a sign attached: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google for their online searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 is being delayed.
It won't be coming in early, but it'll be coming in late 2009, maybe even 2010.
Microsoft is looking to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 simultaneously.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wore it in Blood Diamond by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather.
If we start counting the countless star performances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavy weights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical cotton T-shirt for men, scarless and tail-like.
The English speakers call it `tank.
First, because of its great name, although it is called `Marcel' in the narrow circle. Legend has it that the origin of the name is linked to sport and was derived from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' stands out because of its excellent cotton, its distinctive unisex cut, and is distinguished by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) which these T-shirts have as a detail on the neck cut.
And please note that the Belgian company is not only focused on producing `tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxers retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, striped t-shirts, babies, mini shorts.
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's a shame to use it as underwear.
You're very attractive.
I want to be a young mother; I'm not worried about the candidate'
Her great performance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is graceful, but full of joy.
The Gruz brothers are now taking their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, this means much more than some pretty, rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris promoting Mango, moving her residence there and also presenting the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Mercyful and shy, winner on the short track.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this fall/winter season that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards and attended the Valentine's Day dinner.
A very intensive working time that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what's the basis of your new collection for the fourth season of Mango?
My sister and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 1950s and 1960s, and there are many ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dressed, combining their clothes, which I do often.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything comes together and these areas have a lot in common.
I've been fascinated by clothes since I was a kid, and I always wanted to go to my grandmother's to wander around my aunt's wardrobe and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a theme park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in class and in rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you're moving into the real acting role.
After all, everything is connected, it's like, a lot of respect for the costume designer and her professionalism.
You've recently turned 30, haven't you been in a crisis?
Oh, my God.
I feel better than ever, I feel good when I'm 30.
I find the woman to be mature, to have experience, and to be able to enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've been doing the things I've wanted to do since I was a kid, and that's been giving me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
I've known for a long time that I'm going to be a mother because my body demands it and I also want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried about him.
I will bring my child great happiness and raise him with great love.
As for the art of filmmaking, you keep in mind the work you participated in and were filmed last year.
That's exactly what it is, and I would very much like it to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want everything at once, which of course can't be instantaneous.
I would like to see the last hour and the search for the tomb of Christ performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them.
A couple of days ago, you appeared on the runway with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I've known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for her organization's charity event "Women for a Better World" and the clothes we're showing.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There's a lot about her, and I, as someone who knows her, would tell you that's not true.
I will support the good cause she is involved in.
She asked me to join the parade for this generous cause, but if she comes and asks me to do a handstand, I will do the same.
To support the women of the Third World, whatever it takes.
Drivers who may fall back because of the alcohol level will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who was charged with three counts of alcoholism, install this system in his car that prevents him from starting the car while drunk.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is now part of the report of the Prosecutor General's Office, which says it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
The purpose is to re-socialize the driver, which is why he is given a course for re-educating traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Prosecutor General's Office, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automotive Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of drivers who were reported to have been driving under the influence of alcohol more than once returned to driving.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is connected to a system in the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting when the driver has taken an alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is found to be higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a 2007 study in the United States showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of breaches in the first year after their introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate their implementation, legislative reform can be achieved in the ordinary way, yet a reform of the basic law is required that is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some commercial and public transport vehicles.
The Commission has already decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used to finance the implementation of the programme.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
In a British timetable, at 17:40 local time, the Spanish Air Force plane with the Prince and Princess of Asturias was landing next to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF Airport.
The sun was setting, but its rays still forced him to use his hand as a sunscreen to see the royal couple getting out of the plane.
Directly on the gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official journey.
Oh, very well, so, you can't take people to the airport at this time of day because she's from here or something.
No, she's Spanish, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, that's very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and they know the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar and on the red carpet, including military protection from 27 Marines, who are giving their oaths of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long wind-weaving hair, without ordinary `peep-toes', maybe she was told that a thunderstorm was expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official escort awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television who likes to joke is waiting for them.
The best premium in fashion
There probably wasn't a more suitable place in the world than Paris to showcase a premium fashion brand, and there probably wasn't a more substantially outstanding fashion designer and bon vivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' fashion competition to promote and promote young fashion talent internationally.
The prize is awarded in cash of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the shop window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried out of emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest store in Europe and it was recently opened.
The biggest store is in London.
So many events have taken place that we want to thank fashion designer Valentino for his judging of the competition, and it all ended with a luxury dinner at the Opera National de Paris.
Surrounded by many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with a heavy heart broken by pain because his brother died recently, tore himself apart. He wore the suit from the fashion house and some ELAH jewelry that was breathtaking. He held his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall, and accompanied Valentino to the dinner in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the mango house, greeted the guests and was such a knight, that he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without jackets, because they lent jackets to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, she rushed to the store and she had a pair of pants and a shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress.
Inés Sastre, she did not join the walk through the palace premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on her cell phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, upon arrival at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance for a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, la la, that's the way life is.
1001 Counsel against stress
There's not a thousand, but one more way to forget our chaotic, fast-paced daily lives.
And even if there are few, they're all gathered in a book that says how to relax.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse, the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that causes the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one way to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
But the number is rising, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga poses, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the entire list of options that are tailored to each individual's taste and time.
The book is called `1001 ways to relax' and the peacefulness that the book brings to the bookshops of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If you think that it is impossible to achieve tranquility in areas such as workplace through personal contact, this manual refutes such belief.
In addition, methods are offered to stay in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes are proposed that lead to relaxation.
When the adrenaline in your veins stops rising to restore balance and stress becomes a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, shut your brain down and focus on reading.
Speaking in your sleep
Some children talk at night
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, you'll be terrified at best, but in reality, it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called sleeping talk.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you has been told you spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (once in a lifetime, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child cannot remember anything.
There is no single reason for this phenomenon.
Often, people are looking for connections to other sleeping phenomena, such as nightmares, panic attacks at night, enuresis noctura, sleeping talk, but there's no reason for that.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be very high fiber, stressful situations, or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency of its occurrence is highly variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper, or it may be quite the opposite (crying, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to consult a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus results.
We said it's a positive disorder, so it's not treated, whether it's related to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, sleep apnea or stress).
What you can do is take a series of simple precautions:
Try not to arouse the child before bed.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV shows that are awful and a little too wild.
For nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them gain a measure of inner peace.
It helps the child sleep calmly.
If you're talking in your sleep, try to stay calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child and the next day, he won't be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
It's useless, because the child is unconscious, so you're gonna rip him out of his sleep.
Even though the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if the child is frightened after a few appearances, it is advisable to seek counsel or to find out what the reason for the fear is.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), they will not pressure the child to conduct an interrogation and get more information.
You can't do anything about it, because when the child sleeps, it's unconscious and can't think about it.
And besides, you'll hear what it says, but you won't know what it's dreaming about and why it's saying it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe it doesn't tell the kid that you hear it at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
It's a lot of fear.
So don't worry, it's not bad, it's a moment that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally .
After a long thirst, Illhouses on the field is finally back on track.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks played numerous chances and managed to put one of them into play and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot was just around the corner, the Illhouses were to easily dominate the game, and it succeeded in challenging Denmark's defense with a remote shot, then a high-pass shot by Brain, and Romain with a tip-toe shot.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, leaving only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half was to be decisive, with two goals scored by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards the first goal for the Illhaus by Marais, who was just right to take back a ball that had been rejected in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the ill-housed goalkeeper was not to enjoy his luck for long and was sent to the bank about 12 minutes later, forcing his teammates to play fewer games.
Denmark, however, could not take advantage of this and faced no major problems with an Ilhaea elephant, who only retreated a little to tighten their defence, except in the very last seconds of the game, when the ball passed very close to the lathe after a major mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another stopover to Brittany.
In view of the determination of the fishermen who blocked access to several Brittany and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet with their representatives at the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to welcome him with a constructive spirit and hoped he would come up with concrete proposals.
The President's visit coincides with a general meeting of the crisis committee set up by the British fishermen to implement measures in the face of the extreme rise in diesel prices, which have reached a record high of over EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again and to secure the working conditions and pay of seafarers'.
Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they led protests in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly ten kilometres of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-île were not broken.
The Quiberon Peninsula has been sealed off with a lock.
On Monday, the seamen expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in the early morning hours outside the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes in Vendée, where the fishermen did not leave, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer authorities decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the Ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Guilvinec Crisis Committee must decide on the reaction to the movement and its participation in the discussion scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
The strike will continue, because fishermen will not give up and will not go to Paris, for example, said Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents a liter, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents a liter.
Paul Newman the wonderful
The unforgettable actor from Butch Cassidy and the Kid died at the age of 83 from cancer at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or even Sam Mendes said goodbye to the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the looming recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, is keeping its forecast for 2008 with 215 delivered aircraft, its President Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft with a capacity of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times Sunday, the American International Group, which has been financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering giving up more than 15 percent of its assets to pay back the $85 billion it was offered.
AIG is prepared to direct the sale of a large part of its business beyond its international life insurance and pension provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the AIG board of directors met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets from which AIG would potentially split include its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and its investments in private equity, FT further explains.
The Commission has not yet taken any final decision on these sales, the FT continues.
AIG must make the sale as soon as possible to repay the loans of over 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve, including at the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will lose the same amount.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for the
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House rejected Paulson's plan to save banks, a historic fall in prices: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The highest drop in points in its history (684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade recession following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The final figures show that the Nasdag index, which is mainly technical, has fallen by 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poors 500 index, which is widely used, by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55.
After the House unexpectedly rejected the plan to rescue banks, which was to restore some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, already hit at the beginning of the quarter.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`This is a bad picture that shows Congress unable to adopt a plan,' said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market relied on this plan', she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will be too late.
If the project is indeed doomed to failure (...), it will soon be up to the Fed (the US central bank) and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would further restrict credit conditions,' warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And Ms Piegza stressed, further stressing the sense of extreme urgency, that every day that passes brings the ruin of a financial enterprise in the United States.
After Washington Mutual went bankrupt on Friday, the US authorities planned to acquire Wachovia's banking business from its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing a global crisis, not just an American one, the FTN Financial analyst added.
The market for basic goods has grown considerably.
The revenue of the State Treasury over a period of ten years fell on Friday evening from 3,632% to 3,827% and the revenue over a period of 30 years last night from 4,161% to 4,357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first televised duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to determine who was the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QG's election campaign announced both Republicans and Democrats won their own television duel, which was to be watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, while quite impressive, was not brilliant enough to allow him to halt his decline in electoral issues five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which released a poll on Saturday that found Obama ahead by five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
Among the voters who are still undecided, the ones that are now on the ballot, Obama emerged as the winner with 39 percent, while according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his rival Joseph Biden in his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
`It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts,' Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain continued to highlight his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while clearly highlighting the naivety of his opponent in these questions which were the focus of this first televised duel.
`Senator Obama does not seem to understand that...', he stressed several times.
`I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to become President,' he added.
A point of attack that has been preached in Republican campaign ads since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He spoke briefly and precisely, without being distracted.
He put his ability to make good decisions and to renew the world's image of the United States first.
McCain still doesn't understand, Obama does", this weekend a Democratic campaign campaign was criticized for not capturing the full extent of the crisis that is burdening the street.
During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in a rainy North Carolina election.
The financial crisis is a clear advantage for Obama, who the Americans consider the most appropriate to save the economy even on the brink of collapse.
'The coming week could be a turning point,' said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democrat Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's good economic instincts to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is the conclusion of an eight-year-long bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.'
After reiterating that he would likely even manage to cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that creating a potential energy independence for the country and promoting renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were top priorities for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates are careful to avoid the questions raised by the plan to save the financial market by over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
`Did you notice that an election was held in Minsk?'
Youth and opposition demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening after the closure of the polling stations in Minsk's market square to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukashenko: `The dictator should resign'.
Some admit they didn't vote at all: 'What's the point of doing what they want with my voice?' says one teenager.
They do not believe that the regime which has shown itself to be the best in the light of foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-sharing of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the investing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
`We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the countdown,' regretted Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous twelve-party coalition.
This is a cosmetic change, says Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because who counts the votes matters, and with us it is the executive.
If opposition MPs enter Parliament, it is because they were appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean television broadcasting, regional meetings and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game because dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is deeply indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we don't reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition is concerned that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has monitored the election process, will not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that turnout appears to be too high and that the expansion of early voting (26% of Minsk voters) has opened the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Did you notice that an election was held? asks Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in Parliament, the ones most likely to conform to the government's ideas.'
The silence of the night is descending again over the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - From the Blood That Was Back Safe
Hema-Quebec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And most of all, it has regained the public's trust, which had been severely shaken by the blood-stained scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated with the HIV virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the public's discontent, the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry in February 1994 led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to develop guidelines to prevent another such disaster.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to report, several provinces set up a committee to develop a new system for administering blood preserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec started their work, only 38% of people had confidence in the blood-preservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through work in this area over the following years, we have regained public trust,' she says, before proudly stressing that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is aware that 'trust is extremely fragile'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting on the principle of prudence.
At the time, we saw the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since its inception in 1998.
And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
So we're referring to one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which says that you can use exclusion when you don't know it and when a disease progresses slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by brain degeneration, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was accepted from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was proven beyond a doubt that this disease is transmitted through blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution we have applied has a very good purpose.
In 1999, a much more accurate HIV detection technique was introduced: nucleic acid testing (NAS), which allows the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the donor's blood, rather than the antibodies to the virus, as was the case with previous tests.
The NSTs have enabled us to shorten the incubation period between the time the person is infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood using our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
So the risk of certain donors being infected without knowing it, and you couldn't tell, was reduced significantly.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of AIDS transmission through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of contracting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, you would have to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone could be infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood clots annually, it would take more than 24 years for a case of HIV transmission to occur through a blood clot.
I believe that you can feel comfortable with a blood transfusion or prescription to restore health these days", says the head of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogens can get into the system.
Only last year did the Chikungunya virus appear on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects through blood.
We must keep an eye on it,' continues Dr. Décary, before stressing that Hema-Quebec must provide adequate care in addition to safe care.
`The need is increasing as the population ages.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also affects the blood supply network, which on average only accounts for 3% of Quebec's eligible blood donors.'
Any healthy person 18 years of age or older who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who donate blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is prevalent are excluded from blood donation for one year.
` With this 3% we can get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortage of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but most importantly, to keep them and get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find time to spend an hour donating blood,' regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood preserves but also human tissue, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being inter-storaged at Hema-Québec, which also manages Quebec's only public cord blood bank.
The umbilical cord, which was once considered biomedical waste, contains blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
`Weeks ago we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000th umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to lose more than 1,000 a year.
`We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,' explains Dr. Décary, who describes this umbilical cord blood-thinning programme as very popular.
`Many mothers are convinced that they have no access to this programme', because Hema-Québec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive programme to all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-final
Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinal round of the USL First League play-offs yesterday, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second and decisive game of the quarterfinal series at the Saputo Stadium, which included the overall goal ratio.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the ninetyth minute of the game.
After a goalless first half for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who got Matt Jordan in the way of the Sounders.
Remember, the first game of the pre- and post-game series on Friday, Impact had defeated the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle, 2-1.
In the semi-finals, Impact will be matched by the Vancouver Whitecaps.
Saturday night, Thunder was able to match a 3-1 deficit in Minnesota by a 4-3 win, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinals with a 5-4 overall score.
Impact will have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be decided today.
In short , Victory by Kovalev .
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit made up of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn, launched a storm fire on the Florida Panthers, resulting in a 3-2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two shots and Kovalev converted a pass in this victory, the fourth of the tricolor in six prelims.
Kovalev scored the winning goal by scoring the only goal of the entire shoot-out.
I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel good.'
`He was too fixated on it in the first half, Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a storm of applause.'
Charest is heading north
The Prime Minister does not exclude the possibility of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the Liberal Party's general assembly was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is seeking to be elected in today's by-election.
`Proserving the course of our last major northern border': This is the longterm objective presented by Jean Charest yesterday by visual means at the Quebec Liberal Party General Assembly in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of paint mill was projected behind him.
Three huge screens were showing spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, from Quebec in Google Maps, maps, etc.
Big money like during the election period.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to exclude the fact that he will hold the elections this autumn, even though he had his agenda very busy.
The Northern Plan is the fourth element of the Prime Minister's supposed vision for Quebec, namely that of a new economic area, which includes an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned frequently in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern area at 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is a jewel of enormous potential, but did not give a date, investment amounts or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most, some prospects for more work: especially in the water, forestry and mining sectors, which are being encouraged by the growth of emerging markets and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr Charest's census, the North possesses nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds.
This area is twice the size of France' ` is near us, in Quebec.
It is not only close to us, it is within us,' he stressed, as a way to show clearly that he is seeking to realize a national dream of entrepreneurship.
Quebec has grown greatly through its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, James Bay.
`It's ours, it's our future,' he added after taking a break from the theatre to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, the Prime Minister told the press.
`This is a traditional attitude that all governments have followed.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, and if the opportunity arises I will take this position again on behalf of the government,' he explained.
Furthermore, with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North", he explained, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will be accessible all year round due to the melting of the ice.
In view of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister feels that it is almost a duty to occupy this territory.
What about the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Peking MP for Ungava), have already launched consultations with some 30 communities.
A Committee of Ministers, headed by Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (Transport and Land Resources) has an important role, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large meeting, not necessarily a summit, but an opportunity to create a common vision'.
The development of the North will, moreover, be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North's plan will be discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly, he promised.
Jean Charest described this vision as a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
`Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have re-thinked to turn the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This was, by the way, one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's accession to the leadership of the party.
One of the decisions adopted provides for the renaming of the Beauharnois power station to the Adélard-Godbout dam.
From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the quiet revolution and the nationalization of water power, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party always knew how to shape the future,' explained Jean Charest.
He referred to another conservative project, this time the 'Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In this respect, the Commission considers that the Commission should take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the implementation of the measures.
`That remains between us, but I intend to be there,' he confided to his party members, which sparked applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly not in 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this fall, as he is legally able to.
It stresses that its timetable is full, however, mainly because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general meeting of the weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, particularly those on the Constitution, which were widely accepted.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition has been skeptical of the North Plan's guidelines.
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, reiterated the policy for the development of the north of Quebec introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
She said the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to use it.
If she had done so, we would have gone much further today', said Ms Marois, alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the adoption of a plan north by the government.
`But what we want is for this to be more than just a big show,' said party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from holiday today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
Mr Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (which is ironic) in the Harper Cabinet, was the one who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a disgrace to Canada.
This woman who has fought a never-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing with a government that is the only one of all the countries concerned that has not brought home its fellow citizen who was held in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even consider that Omar Khadr was a teenager when the things that are being accused of him happened.
The only government that, despite Canada's signature to the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and leaves a child soldier to vegetate under inhuman conditions.
The only one that describes itself as a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are calling for Omar Khadr to be brought home to face a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not care that a young adult will be mentally broken forever after so many years of torture.
We are not aware of this yet, but we are witnessing a cunning circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our democracy, this word that Harper is constantly carrying like a flag and that sounds so insignificant from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen can be arbitrarily mistreated, tortured and imprisoned, at the discretion of a government leader who is still supported by a minority (maybe after October 14th he will be a minority...).
Many voters believe that they will find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has abandoned what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this dismissal, and nowhere else.
Free Speech - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its 17 September issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of the Canadian gold mine Barrick Gold.
It confirms, and follows an Orwellian logic, that the world's largest gold mining company has sought a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small, unprofitable publishing house in order to open a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge on the truth, especially in cases of defamation, but on the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference has been completely hidden by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to speak up for their opposite opinion.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight an army of lawyers with very unequal weapons, paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactics of these unequal battles are often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual arrangement that will silence the other side and deter anyone who dares to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things to the public.
In contrast to what is common in many of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, debates in Canada are usually conducted through the exchange of ideas rather than by a bunch of heists.
So it would have been enough if the Gold Mine had unveiled its books and files and opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and with a handshake, he wipes out the petitions and letters supporting the authors of Noir Canada.
I would like to ask the Commissioner how he can do this.
It seems that in the Vice President's world this word only covers the generously paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a rather narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand -- or doesn't want to understand -- is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada is doing so primarily because they reject the brutal stance of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a "crazy" lawsuit (in the course of the public debate Barrick Gold has just made a demand to the authors of Noir Canada that they stop using this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom to conduct academic research and to discover the truth, which is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to research and discuss topics that are not pleasing to the rich companies of the world, who else can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss to the university community, as well as to the public debate, and it is time for governments to take action to limit this kind of unjustified lawsuit.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the top congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months is yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
The main points are: better control of the Members over the practical implementation of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new decrees to curb the number of houses foreclosed on account of arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the companies supported.
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news after a two-day negotiation marathon.
`We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective,' said Henry Paulson, a Bush administration spokesman.
It was all done to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street price crisis,' the Democrat explained.
`This is the basic point: if we don't, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,' Republican Judd Gregg explained.
Negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, fearing the effect of another failure on the investor sentiment.
The deadline agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who were only late in the negotiations, were more likely to be supporters of the agreement, but they did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme manner.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on adding certain provisions to the agreement, especially those designed to allow owners to keep their homes and those that concern the salaries of the executives of the state-saved enterprises.
`If taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain persons, this is not something to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary,' he explained on American television.
When asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: "I'd like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The guidelines I have read [shows] that this is something we will all have to digest and that we can move forward with.
The option of doing nothing is simply unacceptable,' he said.
The $700 billion plan is designed to use taxpayer money to
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that initially led to the collapse of the risky subprime mortgage lending industry before expanding to other forms of widespread lending (PCAA) and eventually led to a freeze in financial strength and the bankruptcy of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican lawmakers who failed last week in their first attempt at a compromise.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain toxic assets of distressed companies should only be backed by the government and not bought, it is believed that they are escaping the dead end.
To round out the views for everyone in Congress, a decree was also added that if the government were to lose money on this program within five years, it could then levy new taxes to recover its invested capital.
The new plan provides for an initial payment of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion could be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of an additional 350 billion has to be approved by a new vote by Congress.
In return for his help, Washington will receive shares in the companies it supports, which will pay dividends to it in the event of profits, and which it can sell back when the storm is over.
The German Government will have the possibility to suspend the foreclosure proceedings relating to the housing loans covered by this plan and to set deadlines for repayment and the compensation paid to the executives of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the House of Representatives to vote on it today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it's still not certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, yesterday there were further votes against this project, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
`Obviously, Washington doesn't understand us,' Republican Scott Garett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is to ask the taxpayers for the cash.'
The Democratic Member of Parliament, Brad Sherman, leader of a group in Congress called the 'Skeptics' Caucus, presents things differently but comes to the same conclusion.
`Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: We ask Congress not to be pressured and to think carefully about what path to take,' he said yesterday.
At the same time, we have again received in Europe the proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy its competitor, which is in great difficulty, after losing 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to the risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
'This is not a waste of money,' said the Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate, we get a vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savings and households value now that uncertain times are looming.'
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank in distress from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, including over 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalised by the British government since the start of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His blue-eyed beauty was long his trumpet, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor with his charming smile free himself from the narcissistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity, and obvious talent must have kept him from a position of power that would bring forth the truly terrible monsters.
But what a great endurance runner!
Paul Newman, who died of lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch on Friday at the age of 83, remains one of the last icons of American cinema during his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, who for a long time was a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his acting, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breaking of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio, the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
Its European roots were to create one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate quality.
Because it reflected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the combatant wounded in battle in the Pacific War, who studied acting at Yale in the early '50s and then went to the Actors Studio in New York before he was successful in theater, television and soon cinema.
This same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans and also a sex symbol, although he had been living in a show business relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and overly sensitive to the glamour of show business disappear, whose mysteries will never be fully solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman has left film lovers in a state of shock this weekend, while all his big roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of ever-changing American filmmaking is moving on with him.
Then comes the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat in the Hat, filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory (1990) is evoked of his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who in his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all of its promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, who was resumed after his death and made Newman famous in 1956.
This nice Ganove in the superb The Sting, which won the Oscar for best picture in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen 's wonderful The Hustler (1961),
That face through the ages, that was him.
Still him.
His resume unites the ages.
Young people know him best from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as the father of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition, the circle closed.
Unlike several movie legends who retired early enough from the world of film, Newman was to remain in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his luxury and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the ' ' 'Underplaying' when he judged his overly expressive performances.
It wasn't always easy for the handsome Paul Newman, who had been a long time in the role.
But he rarely played Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, cynics or desperates, whose perfect portrayal reflected his drift and rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown aspects of his true delicate sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle portrait of a woman full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to this, a work of subtlety and sadness.
In the flood of tributes that swept Newman yesterday, his close friend and former gunman Robert Redford (who had starred together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: "His presence has improved my life and this country".
Generosity and joy in life were essential traits of the late actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the Hollywood strip, is now going to the end.
We have often seen him standing in bowls full of vinagrette, sauces, pastries, or other foods, and we thought this was rather tasteless, although we thought it was fun at first.
Nevertheless, the proceeds from his sales went to his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged himself to the point of shooting.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these sentences: "Always and until the very end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star".
It was an honor to be here.'
And for us, it was an honor to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
A model citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On October 8, the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The defendant is charged in particular with being involved in organised crime, gross negligence and business fraud, and other criminal offences, including forgery of documents.
The Prosecutor's Office claims that the proceeds from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often accompanied by counterfeit invoices.
State funds and grants from the local government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to have been partly transferred to the treasuries of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation and partly to private funds.
As the investigating authorities have indicated, the tendering costs were presented with fictitious invoices and the associations were also found not to have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were forged.
The bills were bought at the market in Józsefváros, and the circular seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices should be issued to was taken on that round trip north of Lake Plate to which István Lados was sent by János Zuschlag.
During this "exploration tour", Lados was to locate guesthouses and restaurants.
He requested invoices on consumption to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Budapest Autonomous Government based on these templates.
These bills are alleged to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András Őri, who, according to our information, was responsible for the drafting of the reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer place.
As two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003 show, the catering company is said to have hosted the 90 member group of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the plant says that such a large group would not have fit into the premises at once.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious errors in form and content.
According to the bill, a boarding house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than 10 people at a time, has 130 guests.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was apparently not limited to Pigal Kft., a restaurant company whose accounting records of clients Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá do not appear, according to the Prosecutor's Office.
As the managing director Győző Farkas of hvg.hu informed him, he immediately realized that the documents were fake when the prosecutor's office presented them to him during an interview.
"Our company name and tax number were wrong on the stamp".
And furthermore, apart from the mistakes in the form, the fact that the plant was supposed to have housed 100 people was also wrong, after having 11 rooms in total that could not accommodate as many people as possible.
The fact that the bill also mentioned food was a fact that the restaurant had been out of business for a long time.
The embittered counterfeiters also failed to verify that the Budapest Travel Agency they targeted only offered travel abroad and thus indicated Hungary travel on the cash bill, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As the investigation revealed, they also included VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, as the company was charged only 15% VAT instead of 25%, and the employees only issued machine invoices, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another error that the 'accounting authorities' made was that they indicated that the service was provided in a case of 'goods transport', although this is not offered by the investment advisory firm, the Prosecutor's Office informed.
Further errors in form - incorrect invoice format, false stamps - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to the XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as counterfeits.
The same was true of Ravenna Bt. and Kunfehértó Sportlager, whose managing directors claimed that they had never issued the invoices.
Another 'mistake' is that the counterfeiters at HIB Kft. in Nyíregyháza were not aware of it: the company was in dissolving itself at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the public account manager therefore claimed not to have issued the invoices himself.
Consciously forged
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware that they had to put in fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is also in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with Zuschlag and Co. In 2003, the GmbH allegedly provided the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület associations with fake invoices totalling HUF 5 million related to unpaid benefits.
However, there was no payment transaction as the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, which the parties forgot to mention in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons directly associated with the accused.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the Ukrainian postman of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based but not-found fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components worth HUF 18 million in total between October and December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been liquidated since 14 September 2005, is said to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The company was managed by a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be supplied by Ivan Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted to having issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH to the Atlasz and Hoppá associations and to the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to having cashed their equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian sailors at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, in reality none of these companies were active, which the defendant said was due to lack of contracts.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to associations linked to the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices totalling HUF 14,2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organisations.
The Prosecutor General's Office considers that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice sum and VAT.
Kubatov is even alleged to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were attached to Biztos Pont's applications.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ('TMA').
Both received forint 500,000 each, but used the sums for an unnecessary purpose.
To cover this up, they submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices from Works Team Kft.
These bills were, incidentally, obtained during a search of Árpád Kemecsei's office in the Ministry of Education.
In the course of the proceedings, some defendants are now expected to confess to the fraudulent conduct of the proceedings, as they have already been filed with the public prosecutor's office.
It could be a sensation if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to make a full confession.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, which are in line with the Commission's proposals.
The question remains whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him to compensate for the bulk of the HUF 50 million damage caused and whether the surrogate is willing to take responsibility in return.
But it is quite possible that the "offender" is now being bribed after his demands for relief from detention and house arrest were met with deaf ears.
While other criminals who have done far greater damage with economic offences and have not compensated for them are on the loose, or at least under house arrest, granting is not allowed.
The Psychology of Overpayment - or Why We Are Ready to Pay More
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the bid.
Neurologists and economists at New York University have now discovered the neurological and economic underpinnings of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an eBay auction, and are willing to pay even exorbitant prices.
Researchers have tried to explore the neurological pattern of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was to play lotto while the other participated in a playful activity - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, participants were able to win money, but increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cortex, was measured in losers of the auction, where the over-offer of the opponent plays a significant role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore believed that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the stratum.
To support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also conducted additional research to track money.
In this case, three groups should offer against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product and then made its own efforts.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward in case they emerged as winners.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was simply that the emphasis on one group was on winning while the other group was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypotheses expressed by neurologists, the members of the "opposite to loss" group were more willing to bet than those in the control or profit group.
"These results cannot be inferred from any previous economic theory.
The behaviour observed at auctions has hitherto been based on the pleasure of winning or risk-avoiding.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved by the imaging neurological process, so we now have a third explanation". - Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should you see a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is the leading cause of death.
The number of infected people is estimated at 100,000 in this country, but only 7,000 are treated, which is because patients often do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver infection and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases are different.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E, through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids (such as sperm, saliva or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B, but there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after consuming the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and itching.
After that, the yellow fever appears on the skin and eyes, the stool becomes bright, the urine dark, and recovery can take up to two to three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people are on medication.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people are unaware of their condition, since the pathogen is subtly destroying liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular control checks, is essential.
There are three groups of people who are more likely to develop this disease: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
The number of people with chronic hepatitis C is currently estimated at 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease is already detectable by routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to see a family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
If the disease is detected in time, it can be cured, the virus can be eradicated, thus eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
World Hepatitis Day is celebrated on 30 September, and for the first time in 2004 it was organised by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of the chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers experience less pain?
As recent research shows, religious faith is a kind of "pain medicine" that has already eased the deaths of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: They examined the extent to which belief in God influences people's feelings of pain, reports the British newspaper Telegraph.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
In fact, a brain scan technology showed that Catholics could activate the part of their brain that regulates pain.
The study was the first in a research project involving philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
In the experiment, the subject was attached to his left hand a sparkling device that gave the electroshocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: one, a 17th-century image of the Mother of God by Sassoferrato, and the other, Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermel".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a religious trance among the faithful, while they chose Vinci's image because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt as calming.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and in that time, they received a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages, while they were either looking at the religious or the other paintings.
Catholics reported that they felt "safe" at the sight of the Mother of God, as if "concerned", and they felt "quiet and peace".
While they were looking at the religious painting, they reported over 12% less pain than when they were looking at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who was also involved in the experiment, said that you could produce similar effects with other images that were very effective even among atheists, if you just had to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find a picture that would trigger very positive feelings, like a mother or a father", says the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and it does in many cases", says Wright.
After these excellent results, the only question remains what effect a Madonna painting by Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain-regularity of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary produce even better results?
You're what you tell yourself
On the occasion of its tenth birthday, Google can rightly say that it is in people's pockets just as much as it is above their heads in the sky: it knows where people have spent their holidays, which doctors they go to, and what moves them.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's CEO.
To the skeptics who are plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he points out that they would just overlook the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times recently, Schmidt said that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company's original goal of "ordering all the information in the world".
Schmidt explained that after 10 years of world-changing work, Google is still just beginning to collect information.
When asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google could answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job is really right for me?" but software programs are not yet capable of doing so because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search terms, IP addresses and pages visited are recorded during their Internet searches.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save and retrieve their own search history, so that the hits can be generated much more accurately later, and the same logic is used to make the so-called "recommendations" that the system uses to recommend tailored products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some are concerned about whether Google's data monopoly is there.
In most cases, however, it is the potential power represented by the company that is fear-inspiring, and less so the guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the rejection of power that many Internet users finds.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored but also shared with third parties where appropriate, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A recent example of this was the Brazilian anti-pedophilia campaign, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site Orkut, which also allowed the pedophiles to be identified.
However, users concerned about their personal rights were able to catch their breath back in May when Google successfully sued the FBI together with the civil rights organization EFF, so that no constitutional provision could force Google to release information to the FBI at any time in the future.
(The German government, however, successfully obtained the issue of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms in reference to the Law on the Protection of Young People, which was passed years ago, but was denied the list of individual users, or their list of web and search terms, for two months in retrospect.)
Google's image remains controversial: Those who are reluctant to release their personal data because they fear that using Google will lose their privacy and privacy are infuriating the company with the outrage that is due to the companies that claim to be conservative.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even though both are struggling for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require any identification codes from its users and provides its services free of charge, so an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems far more attractive, youthful and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, geeks are keenly aware of the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has been particularly prominent in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, which means that users deliberately leave their tracks and use the available communication channels, and even if the scale varies individually, the main thing remains the same: showing up publicly.
The average teenager can manage his profile on multiple community portals at the same time - from Facebook to Xanga, can link them through other services, such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm, and can finally integrate all of this into a tracking system like FriendFeed or Blip.fm. They can also run blogs that automatically showcase the latest photo galleries that have been scanned on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove it: looking at the party photos last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful boyfriend was having fun with, or the employee is fired for just being too honest about his anger about the management of the company in his blog - one thing is for sure: The term "privacy" has been completely reinterpreted by now.
Those who live online are what they reveal - in a way that could form the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even bypass Google's monopoly, can do that with pleasure -- like with Scroogle, a tool that can access Google's search engine but intentionally leaves no trace.
Many people don't register on community sites to avoid being found, but Google's online applications, such as word processing and graphics tools and RSS feeds, can also be handled with alternative versions that aren't tied to huge server parks and therefore don't generate the best possible user profile.
But public opinion is waiting until Google shows its true face.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space is threatening advertising revenue, and the increasingly rapidly deployed services are causing head-bursts not only for Microsoft but also for other software developers.
Critics, however, also find the counterpoints worrying: for example, the Group's management completely rejected an employee protest after the company's own kindergarten fees were doubled, and management thought that multiple staff feeding was too expensive, but all this suggests that Google even knelt before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed to an agreement that all regime-critical hits, or those that violate good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal rules are that no new service is advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the months and years ahead could again take a big turn: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning or archiving project is now taking the company to the point of having to deal with the Supreme Court, others are more concerned about the 'Health' system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database is already providing the next generation of sci-fi writers with the stuff -- like "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow, which describes in the best of Orwellian fashion a future where a human being is terrifically approachable thanks to data from Google.
Two teenagers help the double murderer in Ózd to clear his tracks
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, police have now questioned two young people who are suspected of having helped to remove the traces, the spokesman for the police commissioner's office Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people have admitted to the charges and are currently being charged with aid.
According to the MTI news agency, these are two girls who are defending themselves on their own.
The aid is punishable by a prison term of up to five years.
The suspect in Ózd's double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of deliberately murdering several people out of greed for money.
As the investigation progressed, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger sum of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect, however, refused to pay his debts, so on Wednesday he lured his creditor to a plot of land in Ózd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act by hand - this is also proven by the fact that he committed the murders with a concealed weapon at the crime scene.
The police are now investigating the weapon and the circumstances surrounding its use together with experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a purchase offer for the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered around EUR 200 million, or 5 billion Czech crowns, for the 100% purchase of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The Commission has also taken note of the fact that the Czech authorities have not yet issued a statement on the proposed measures.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is wholly owned by the state.
The Polish State is in the hands of 99% of the shares, but it wants to sell more than 60% of the shares in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily E15, the Polish offer is the highest price ever offered on the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the paper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the stakeholders, the Warsaw Stock Exchange was probably the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
Under the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25% stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14,7%, and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13,5%.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the increasingly severe international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers spoke of "Second 11 September" on Tuesday.
The global financial crisis we owe to the American president, La Repubblica said, for example, that the president was not even able to turn his own party for the bill behind him into one that would bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more encouraging to speak of a "second 9/11".
Parts of the Madrid press are also tracking the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is the reason why the world economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is in danger of collapsing more and more, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now that the vote in Congress has been passed, there is a danger that Washington will not have a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air, at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, says the Geneva "Tages-Annonceur".
It is true that some countries could provide bailouts to their shaky financial institutions and use taxpayer money to save banks from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks fail, then neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control over money markets.
More than EUR 100 billion was paid out to weakening financial institutions on Monday alone, recalls the Wiener "Der Standard".
So far, the EU has not taken seriously the crisis that is now sweeping the old continents like a tsunami.
While the "saviors" would not have to "walk" several hundred billion euros immediately, it would be wise to note when it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers' money to avoid even greater damage.
Smart car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What better way to develop new accident prevention technologies than to imitate the obstacle sensors that come from nature?
Like the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented that inspired Nissan engineers from bumblebees to create new crash-prevention systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C type car-robot-driven biomimetic system, a mini car equipped with the characteristics of bees, to support the development of a system that avoids collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The bee's composite eye, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
To mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers adopted the idea of a laser-controlled distance meter.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180 degree field of view within 2 metres, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of a second, and the car robot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of bees, by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver is purely instinctive.
"If it were not for this, the car robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles", explained Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot project.
The system must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer that is currently still considered unavoidable in accidents.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And that's gonna take a fraction of a second.
However, unlike bees, the evasion cannot be up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, only in the direction of the tire's rotation.
While bees here have endless opportunities to avoid other bees, the researchers at the car robot have been able to use only the rotation, or acceleration, and braking, to do so.
BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it's about instinctive, intelligent response, and less about processing the data, and less about the ability to store it.
This device only has to process a few inputs per second and respond to them accordingly.
It doesn't have to store them, or it doesn't have to produce an intuitive, logical response using previous maneuvers, so it only takes a handful of KBs of memory at a time.
It doesn't need gigabytes or megabyte of memory.
This is the first step in the development of the instant collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in series production within the next ten years.
Another application of GPS satellite navigation technology could be to guide the driver around obstacles and to the destination.
A Name for the Sinful Child
Now we have the written version of the $700 billion heavy bailout bill, which will be implemented in several stages and is aimed at buying bad loans from banks.
The first round is supposed to be half the money spent.
In a meeting that ended Saturday after midnight Eastern Shore local time, congressmen reached an agreement on the $700 billion bailout package after days of debate, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress", said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, and said the agreement needed to be written down.
The rescue package was agreed upon by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
As a result, Finance Minister Henry Paulson said: "The program will work and it will be efficient, but we need to do more". Pelosi said it was not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing down the steering wheel of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. Washington time Sunday evening at 8am (Monday Central European time 2am), but did not trigger a market surge.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote on the 2008 economic stabilisation bill, and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made overnight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
The programme, however, deviates from the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on the purchase of lazy, borrowed securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the $700 billion contribution is to be spent, with $250 billion available immediately after Congress votes on the cause, as expected on Monday, to be spent on the purchase of credit-impaired, bad securities, and the remaining $100 billion to be decided by the President.
The programme is reviewed by a separate committee, which also includes the Federal Reserve Chairman.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another congressional decision.
Under the law, the Treasury can also use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-laden securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As the Ministry's officials have reported, the purchase can be made both at auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funds of concern and the companies pay the corresponding fees for the expected losses.
Henry Paulsen said that the law defines the necessary resources so that up to $700 billion can be made available as immediate assistance to the American financial system, whether it be for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready to introduce the law once it is signed, Paulson said.
The heads of the banks in trouble and now in need of state aid can expect the government to cut their settlements, known as the "Golden Handshake" overseas.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the implementation of the programme.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry buys at auction, the 'Golden Handshake' is taxed, unless the retired bank manager is retired.
In the event of a direct purchase of the bad loans, the government will take aggressive action to ensure that managers' salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also shows that the existing Golden Handshake agreements will not be changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements to get more people involved in the program.
This is the first time in American history that cuts in managers' salaries have been regulated by law, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, about the measure.
The State gains ownership rights in the participating banks, reducing the risk to taxpayers, who can also participate once the economy and thus the rescued bank recover.
The bill requires the president to submit to Congress a proposal within the next five years to help taxpayers recover lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That's not what American citizens expect of us, the plan is not to protect taxpayer money at all, says California Republican Darrell Issa.
His Ohio colleague, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were being carried out by the same people who were also responsible for the Wall Street collapse.

No more visas to the U.S. from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the US-Hungary visa agreement will come into force on January 12, as the foreign minister told the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In their view, 'it is now up to the Commission to ensure that the electronic immigration or control system is implemented overseas in a timely manner.'
The Commission also stressed that the new system will not allow entry, but that tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington starting today.
She will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will award her the Hungarian Republic's "Middle Star Cross of Merit", and she will also hold talks with Democratic foreign policy advisers Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support a bailout package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians who are demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Congress and government officials announced Sunday morning after days of marathon deliberations that they had reached an agreement on the bank bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis and the freezing credit market became central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than their respective opponents in leading the country out of the economic crisis.
Recent polls have shown that Obama has been able to expand his lead on economic issues, while McCain's high, which he won by the Republican presidential nomination of Sarah Palin, has also been melted down.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those consumer protection passages he supported.
"We must act now, and we must act responsibly . . . - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened", he told 35,000 spectators.
He didn't miss calling McCain's economic vision "obsolete".
In an interview with ABC, McCain stated: "We will all have a hard time with this . . . but not doing is definitely not an option".
The Republican senator said the plan also stipulates setting up a control committee for the finance minister, as well as restricting the clearance of top managers - something he insisted on.
CBS told Obama that McCain had no definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the secretary.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press release of the German-speaking area
The right wing is intact, only the voters have become more confident within the camp - this is how "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern in order to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article "Bavaria's Revolution kills its fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have been renewing Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
The breakthrough is also a problem for Christian democracy, as is the case for Angela Merkel.
The disaster of the CSU did not come as a surprise, but something happened on Sunday, which was already happening almost exactly ten years ago: the unquestionable hegemony of a state party.
Because 10 years ago, 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, falling below 50 percent for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, which is still the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The CSU's systematic modernization in Germany has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
The socialist movement in Bavaria, which has been growing rapidly, has been predicted by sociologists for 40 years, but the secularisation, the educational successes and the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria have not been able to keep the CSU's voters loyal.
Modernisation always comes with increasing options, and this has political consequences.
The right wing is intact - only the voters inside the camp have become more critical and self-aware.
It is noteworthy that in recent weeks the classical groups of citizens have expressed the greatest distinction to CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and electors with a bachelor's degree such as a university degree.
Here, CSU support fell to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily newspaper reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders with reservations on coalition issues" an article about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the EPP.
The EPP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens are not yet ready to decide on a coalition.
The new elections are over and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates on public television the party leaders barely looked at their cards.
The SPÖ chief Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current OVP chief as vice chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters chose the bowl-molterer course.
The Commission has not yet decided on the basis of the draft budget.
Molterer, however, has been cautious about red offers.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of the use of the public transport system in the Member States is therefore not a sufficient basis for the Commission's decision.
Whether his party is in opposition or joining the coalition is currently completely open and these issues should be discussed within the OPC.
The BZÖ chief, Jörg Haider, showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take government responsibility", said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equality of Opportunities, which will be organised by the EU Presidency, France, has opened in Paris today.
In her address to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, MEP for the European People's Party, drew attention to the education segregation, which is one of the most serious violations of rights facing Roma children and the biggest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and the EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Vladimir Spidla.
The participants included representatives of governments, European social partners and the most important European legal and civil protection organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the Fidesz MEPs' press office reports, Járóka has pointed out that in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma will be displaced from the labour market primarily because of their low levels of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no secondary education and, thanks to poor primary education, only a small proportion of them can obtain a university degree".
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right and has a key role to play in the implementation of other human rights.
Investments in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economies of EU Member States.
The Members believe that it is important that the broadest possible range of Roma and non-Roma are aware of these links.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the more likely he is to become a productive member of the labour market, and the more they contribute to national expenditure through income and turnover taxes.
"As citizens of the Union, the right of Roma to high-quality education must be guaranteed - the poor and segregated education must be stopped", says Lívia Járóka.
As the Member stated, a common, action-oriented and targeted approach by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the process of desegregation in the education sector, and the correct implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as fully-fledged citizens", Járóka urged.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the promotion of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom from discrimination at European and national levels, in the spirit of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities'.
CSU: Grace in time
At the end of October , the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided .
Despite the electoral stalemate, at times there are no heads, and at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein are still in office, the question is just how long this grace will last.
The fate of the Tandem after the disastrous 17 percent loss of votes will be decided at the extraordinary party congress last weekend in October.
But the much-schooled duo already made it clear that they don't want to stick to their seats.
They are trying to appease the angry faction and the party base who demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bayerian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they have only managed to secure 43.4 percent of the vote.
For 46 years, the CSU was the sole ruler in Bavaria, which accounts for 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
The Conservatives remain the driving force in the southern German state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but they will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As a first sign of the internal restructuring of the party, the potential successor of Huber, Vice President and Federal Minister for Agriculture Horst Seehofer, is also included in the exploratory team conducting exploratory talks with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing Free Voters, about a possible Munich coalition.
The irony of fate is that with the list of "Free Voters" comes those Gabriele Pauli in the legislature whose anti-Stoiber performance the Huber-Beckstein duo first exploited to serve the ambitious politician mercilessly.
CSU leadership is now focusing all its efforts on stabilizing Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings out of the background, will play an active role.
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards the CDU - he felt the CSU deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a lot to the success at national level in 2005, is not reinstated by a joint force, Merkel cannot become Chancellor again after the September 2009 Bundestag elections.
Merkel, who has not hidden her disappointment with the fiasco, believes that the loss of CSU territory will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
The problem is that the injured CSU will not be easier to govern and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures.
In the elections on Sunday, no opposition member of parliament made it to the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects that there are irregularities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
The legislature of the 10-million-strong state has been without opposition for decades, but the opposition party, which was assembled under the name of United Democratic Forces (UDC), has been serious about hoping that Lukashenko, who renewed his presidential term for the fourth time in the unfair election and a constitutional amendment in 2006, will "allow" some opposition MPs in parliament.
The SDG has therefore even abandoned the boycotts it had planned.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly economically dependent on Russia's increasing natural gas imports, and has even taken loans to ease the price increases, and the country has also agreed to sell Beltrans gas, the owner of the gas pipeline that runs through the country, to the Russians.
The OECD election evaluation report provided a temporary relaxation, with a focus on the positive movements rather than the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's Rapid Report on Monday criticized the campaign - which suggests that opposition figures should not be in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the vote count.
Despite this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been freed, and Minsk is even prepared for minor confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse to recognize the independence of the seceding Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, which forms Ukraine on paper as a federal state, has considered the two territories as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun", Alexander Milinkievich told our paper.
The opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election said it was desirable to continue, even though "the powerful were afraid to let even one opposition member into parliament".
The opposition is not planning any protest action in view of the results, but rather is trying to make the need for economic reform clear to voters.
"We have a lot of problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of distributing stones, but I still see more and more people supporting change, even the elderly", Milinkovich said, pointing out that even the most supported class of pensioners does not agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the creation of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the rising trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the 'social security' that is based on the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble", Milinkievich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in deeds, not words".
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are rotating doors for the entry and exit of officials.
The Commission has already decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used to the same extent as those of the Member States.
The new 'Anti-Faulkner Law' was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Cabinet of Ministers.
">"Rolling doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through higher attendance rates and more services", said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency is beginning.
This is reformism", Brunetta stresses once again.
The Palazzo Chigi will end the construction of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers' premises.
Masi says that "the choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
The Secretary-General assured that there was no official opposition: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides".
All in all , there 's no breakfast left during business hours , no more coffee or croissant .
Brunetta advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Supercommittee on Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
The Minister of Labour, from Rome, says that "in three months, official absences have decreased to 50%, which means that 60,000 more people are present at work per year".
It adds that it is necessary to improve the efficiency of Italy's public administration
"Wages dynamics, the Minister said, have been twice as high as the private sector and far above inflation over the last eight to ten years".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have come together to fight the Brunetta decree as part of the appeal backed by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is profiling with figures of lower absenteeism at work", the Consumer Centre writes, "the population of the 'lazy workers' is continually growing.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have joined forces to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree".
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of sick workers, during which control visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2500 workplace accidents occur, three people die and 27 remain lifelong disabled.
In fact, the data from the Instituto Nacional Contra gli infortuni sul lavoro (Institute for National Safety and Health) for 2007 confirm that there were approximately 1200 fatal accidents at work.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murder.
Today, the National Association of Mutilate and Invalides in the Labour Force will celebrate in all Italian provinces the 58th National Day for Victims of Work Accidents to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data circulated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the decisiveness of the issue of prevention in the workplace", President Giorgio Napolitano of the Republic confirmed in his message to Pietro Mercandelli, President of the Association of National Mutilati and Invalidity Workers.
The President of the Republic expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to supporting the families of the victims and to raising public awareness".
"A disgusting 'Basta' has arisen, understandable in the case of tragedies that, given their scale, cause some media turmoil and public participation, but the reality of everyday life often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "in any case there is also a resource problem: there must be a decisive investment in education and information".
The number of initiatives to increase the direct awareness of young people in school who are taking part in the workplace is of particular importance.
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to distract from its social gravity.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths is an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards definitive rules aimed at ending the problem".
"The data on work-related accidents seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of work-related deaths is far too high", emphasises Pietro Mercandelli, president of the Anmil.
"We don't want this 'positive trend' to mean less attention.
"We believe that we are doing too little to combat the phenomenon of accidents, and we can fight it through different actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary  as Mercandelli says; but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already starting school".
"Further efforts are needed", he adds, "in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in relation to a social emergency".
Mr Mercandelli also spoke of the "continuing deterioration in the protection of workers in accidents" and called for the "abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
'The aim is therefore to give the worker a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or random donations decided by a legislator from time to time.'
MP3 player under indictment: danger of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable musical instruments, such as mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing loss.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a report published today in Brussels quoted the opinion of the EU's CSrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks).
"The report  states in a note  that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music on portable musical instruments for more than one hour a day for at least five years a week are at risk of permanent hearing loss".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who normally turn portable music devices and cell phones to high volume will cause irreparable damage to their hearing without knowing it", says Meglena Kuneva.
'The scientific findings  suggest that there is a clear risk on the part of the EU  which urges rapid action.
What really matters is to raise awareness among consumers and make this information a collective asset.
In view of this scientific evidence, we must review existing control systems to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology".
The Commission has also proposed a new programme for the development of the European Community's mobile music industry.
'The scientists confirm that they are rightly concerned and that the European Commission will now, together with the other EU Member States and those concerned, examine the measures necessary to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable musical instruments and similar devices.'
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable musical instruments to 100 dB, and there is concern about the damage that could result from too much noise.
These damages can be greatly reduced by using solutions such as reducing the volume and length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the European Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music devices only listen to loud music for five hours a week (above 89 decibels), the legal limits on maximum noise levels in the workplace will be exceeded.
Those who exceed this limit in music risk complete hearing loss within five years.
This is 5 to 10% of the users of such devices, which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno is launching the Commission for the Future of the Capital
We start today, we're supposed to be done in March, we're supposed to be doing a balance sheet in June.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of the Capital, Rome.
In six months' time, President Marzano and the other 49 Commissioners will be drawing up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City and City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the capital and Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it", emphasises Alemanno.
There is no redistribution of powers, only the desire to have a place where one can develop a major project for Rome.
In March, the Commission will be dissolved and its task will be completed, since such a project must have a definite end date.
In June, the Mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan to use the work done by the Commission.'
Germanno replied to those who questioned the Commission's competence because of its lack of commitment: 'It all depends on the work the Commission will do and the quality of its proposals.
If it delivers quality results, as in France the Attali Commission did, and this will certainly be the case in Rome, then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is concerned with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to look ahead to a longer period of time in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective".
The Mayor of Rome is very keen to clarify: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a penny and it will make us think.
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to make the leap of quality - which it really needs - and thus take a joint step into the future".
A future, says the Mayor of Rome, which "will not only be confined to the current municipal boundaries but will look much further", not only in terms of Rome's role as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama  the first anti-American president?
A well-known American politician who wants to be considered independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the U.S. economy through his decisions and established relations with hostile Islam (and still does so as a private man)".
The attacks on Obama are getting fiercer, right now, as the election draws near.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama is very shy: he thinks he will get the highest office in a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!"
But actually, these attacks don't have much to say; they're racist attacks and they don't answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president?
Again, there are people who talk with the heart and not the head.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial that only in the polling booth will we know who the true American patriot will vote for.
Here a mentality of the United States is emerging that has been kept hidden until recently.
"Say what you will, and we will decide who we will make our crutches for, whether for Obama or for McCain".
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we'll emigrate from America.
Something you've never heard before, only now that the black candidate's success seems so certain.
Anyway, despite all this consideration, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
In fact, the report shows that the United States has a very high rate of inflation.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority the weak point of Bush.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
The financial collapse is leaving its mark on journalists too: the cuts are already visible in the newspapers.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not express any real concern to the authorities about the general credibility of the information.
You're not as lonely as you used to be.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The crisis of 2008 is a crisis for these journalists of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are the shortcuts to the newsroom, the room where the editors work to compile the paper.
It is a problem that must be solved  so the journalists interviewed  if we are to prevent traditional journalism from shrinking substantially as the general public understands it.
A clear but complicated pessimism fills the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and senior executives in the press believe that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local sector, executives are even at 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to imagine the direction the web is heading.
The main publishing groups are making their way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they wanted to join the new technology in the hope that "it will bring something good to journalism".
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors at national level are confident, their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% are at local level.
Some think it has to do with "workplace safety".
The number of managers who fear losing their jobs within three years is 47% at national level.
The number of journalists is 30%.
The theme of "safe working" in the team (our "editorials", Ed. d. Ed.) is always a topical issue in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers offer what they like and so it becomes a question of take it or leave it.
The editors are often paid very high salaries, but the editor can sometimes only get 10,000 euros a month, plus pension and insurance.
As far as holidays are concerned, the matter is complicated: a certain number of days in the first year, so and so after the third, to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become "sick" during the year.
It's a question of the climate.
The European Union has also been a key player in the fight against terrorism.
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate agent who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the counter-contract investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residency in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial capital to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such a dismissal (against which the public prosecutor's office had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and obtain the evidence against him.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the House voted against the White House's $700 billion austerity package: a large portion of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the New York Times' report of yesterday's issue, which reported that the crisis is breaking up the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives who are hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world, and which wins voters, especially in the south and center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
The above example is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is predicting or even already representing: not only in the United States, but also in the whole of the West and perhaps beyond.
In both the States and Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the long-feared events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions that have close links to foreign countries and manage a huge amount of the wealth of private households living in a single state.
This is a direct political problem for governments: how to deal with the families affected, who are also a huge electorate.
The crisis is therefore economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have become a thing of the past and lost its right to speak: the EU has given clear evidence of this, which, because of its division, cannot find a common path in various national and international conflicts.
So everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; bailout plans, new rules, and, in particular, the distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become more serious, only the United States is in the economic position of rescuing itself without foreign aid.
In addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: two conditions which cannot be overlooked under certain circumstances, which no other international organisation or market will be able to use in a similar way.
The new emphasis on the national and state element is in perfect harmony with the increasing importance recently associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is now, when we were so convinced that we had long since entered a connected global realm, a realm of ever-differentiating technologies, of the intangible, that we suddenly have to realize how our future will increasingly depend on the essentially material things: water, harvest and oil.
While these can all be transported from one place to another in the world, they are nevertheless connected to a narrowly defined piece of land  a territory.
The one who has such a territory therefore has an advantage over another who lives in a harvestless, waterless or oil-rich area.
I shall now come to the second novelty, which requires a brief delay.
If you say territory, if you say government, if you say politics, you also say leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to be creating two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there's the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, so the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of resentment over the existing governments, particularly those of the economy, which have emerged as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, intolerance, a sense of purposelessness, a sense of distance, all directed at a whole class of managers in Western countries.
It seems that the belief among large parts of the population is that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but also their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, that the content of which is increasingly alien and supernatural to the majority.
The demand for leadership, therefore, is underground fueling a branched but powerful movement to undermine the ruling class and the traditional political establishment, manifested in unforeseen "rebels" by voters and the immediate change in the collective mood of recent times: starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
The old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, have become increasingly difficult to understand and therefore less representative of what is happening in the lower social strata of the West today, exacerbated by the financial crisis and driven to the extreme.
In view of all this, it would be simply an exaggeration to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The Super Glue That Lifts Up Walls
To defeat the forces of gravity with a glue and climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which now seems to be almost at its destination.
Using a glue that was applied to an area of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers were able to fix a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The study, published by the American journal STUDIO, was the result of research by researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material the team has invented is a further development of the already used adhesives, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged into a pile of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of geckos, which are covered with microscopic scales that give the animal a perfect grip.
Tests of various materials, such as teflon glass and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the reptile's feet' strength and "can easily be removed from the wall", says Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be used as a passing adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe they do, but the researchers are thinking of a less fascinating benefit, like connecting electrical devices, because nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in the space sector.
So for now, the superheroes have to wait.
The University of California, Berkeley, is also devoting itself to a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, scientists in California present a glue made of microfibers that cleans itself of dust by moving on a surface like hair, thus maintaining a perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in the summer, especially because of their refreshing quality and their high vitamin content, can cause serious health damage when taken at the same time as certain essential medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, has repeatedly pointed out the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with medication intake. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again raised the alarm: One glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the intake of certain vital medicines to the point where they are virtually eliminated and thus endanger the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected of increasing the effects of certain medicines, such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular medicines, anxiolytic and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
MEDICaments in GEFER  In a report two years ago, the same Agency warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture and stressed the need to be careful what is taken in combination with medicinal products such as diazepan or methadone.
It is not just a fruit  According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit medicines.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
The Commission therefore made the following appeal to Michele Carruba, Director of the Università Statale di Milano: 'Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers who are free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still uncertainties, do not be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor", emphasizes the Ansa expert.
The Nobel Prize in Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activity.
55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001, attacks, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman claimed in a New York Times headline that this second event was more decisive in U.S. history than the attacks.
A prediction which received a great deal of controversy and which was presented to the economist years later, but which is now proven to be quite correct.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the Enron or Worldcom scandals disappeared from the public eye", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank's Executive Committee, Krugman is a "high-value economist" but also a "very aggressive, especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, the third version of the "anti-Microsoft" package is coming out.
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software is gaining a growing number of users, both at home and in the office, both freelancers and the public administration, as a free replacement for Microsoft Office.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presented to the public with some new features: in addition to a revised and now more Spartan-designed start menu, it has finally achieved basic compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest standard ISO version.
The Commission also discussed the compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read through OpenOffice.
Interestingly, there are also some new features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send via email, including the ability to import PDFs into graphics modules while preserving the original look of the page.
Now, we can also generate "hybrid" PDFs that extend the typical graphics of Adobe to include the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of applications: tables can now be edited by multiple users, thus avoiding conflicts when changing; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a frog to ensure a better correction process.
Some companies are currently publishing various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is expected to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent home or to the office.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should adopt a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment and the environment, which is intended to encourage the use of the public procurement system.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training, which is an optimal aid for small and mediumsized enterprises and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word-based text-editing program; Calc, the table program that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for creating presentations like PowerPoint; Dbase, for running databases instead of the more familiar Access; and finally Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads  a target that can be easily exceeded with 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
The fourth doping case was also tested positive for charcoal.
A new doping case has opened up in the context of the previous Tour de France: Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who was third and won the best climber's jersey.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver to test positive for the third-generation EPO, Cera, which was previously tested on the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis of the blood samples from the cabbage is one of those that were carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the test results confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be banned from the race for two years.
The head of the French Anti-Doping Commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive Epotest and informed the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber.
The New York Times asks: Is Italy racist?
Italy, "the former country of immigrants, has recently become one of the most preferred countries for immigrants", who are only accepted with reluctance.
Does this make the Belpaese a nation of racists? asks the New York Times in a long article devoted entirely to the topic of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young man, Abdul William Guibre, of Burkina Faso origin, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case is a testament to what the Times calls the "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those with "the most integration and employment opportunities", yet "the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiment and the greatest support for the Lega Nord".
In a statement confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times cites further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just that.
The new legislation introduced by the League against immigration and to expedite the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A move that the Pope and the President also emphasize: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal to cooperate between church and state to combat racism".
Student women victims of high rental prices of up to 900 euro per room
The student housing market is not in crisis.
According to the latest study by Sunia, the rental union, a single room can cost up to 900 euros a student in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious traits, with whole groups of students losing their right to study in fact because their families are unable to support them at this level", says Laura Mariani, head of Sunia, "and the high demand from students in these cities is leading to a market distortion that has also hurt other residents.
In addition, most rental offers involve a number of violations: free contracts, no registration, no rental price limit, unauthorized sub-leases.
In the case of Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures which, by revising the taxation, lead to lower rental prices.
A closer look at the study shows that in Milan a sleeping area in the Brianza district costs around 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, the average cost of a bed is 350/400 euros, a room is 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the districts around the university, 250/280 euros is needed for a bedside table, 370 to 500 euros for a single room.
In Rome, prices in the districts around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 euros for a double bedroom.
Rents in the neighbourhoods surrounding the other universities of Rome are only slightly lower: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who escape from outer regions can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples, you need 300 to 450 euros for a place to sleep, and for a room, the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a bed and breakfast costs 250-350 euros, a single room costs at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater impact on the urban economy.
In cities where rental to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rents 25-30% above average are demanded by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema. Cities close their historic cinemas.
Historic cinemas are closing due to the advantageous multiplex cinemas.
"A city without a cinema is a blind city, like a face without eyes".
This picture by Giuseppe Tornatore illustrates with effect what is happening in the major urban centres of Italy and also in the provinces.
The process of excluding cinemas, which began with the birth of the great multi-room complexes in the periphery, means in the long run the death of the one-room cinema in the centre, a process that not only seems inevitable and irreversible, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
Most of the time, historical places are filled with memories, "it's like losing a friend who's been on a road full of emotions", says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which won him an Oscar and the Grand Prix at Cannes 20 years ago.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: over the last five years, the vast number of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; most of these were in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The regions most affected are Emilia-Romagna, with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is in these three regions that the greatest number of modern cinemas have been registered: with 195 in the last five years, Lombardy is the leader, 81 are in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way", says Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "while it is useful that new structures are also emerging, the first priority is the preservation of the existing one, because when a hall is closed in the city, not all its main customers are willing to go to a multi-plex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
The Commission has already adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights in the field of social security.
It is a shame from an ethical and moral standpoint that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to maintain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed.'
The case of Bologna is interesting, the first Italian city to decide to protect the old cinemas by means of an agreement between the municipality and the Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and support traditional cinemas in the historic centre and the periphery.
The measures envisaged include tax advantages for cinema operators and public transport benefits: driving in the restricted areas of the centre and parking at lower parking fees will be allowed.
"It is a pleasant initiative", says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow our example and also develop new concepts.
But we certainly need better audio and video equipment to counter the superpower of multiplexing, because the audience today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been a major issue for me: the closure of the Baghiera Super Cinema, the place of my childhood and youth, was the key point that led me to found Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale on the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to avoid having to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and the 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The accusations of the Kalabrien Anti-Mafia Authority's prosecutors against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, the lawyer who bears the same name as the clan's boss, were also arrested for their involvement in mafia criminal organizations, and were ordered to pay a total of 10 million euros in damages.
"In defiance of all moral and legal standards", the lawyers write, "the two local administrations decided to pay lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities".
"This enabled the mafia group to officially infiltrate the council chambers and to participate in the policy of public administration".
The president of the regional committee of Calabria, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter links between local authorities and organised crime".
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who keep a white vest".
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, which the police said were used to decapitate the Piromalli clan.
Since the end of last April, the municipality of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but as early as 1991  and even then, due to alleged links between organised crime and local administration  the local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected as head of the Coalition for Middle-Justice following the May 2006 general election.
He shouted outrage when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He accused Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti of inventing everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges explain in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the Piromalli clan even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
A hearing in connection with the Dal Torrione investigation showed a willingness to respond to the wishes of a businessman who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli, which has made the actions of the public administration identical to the interests of that clan.'
When the energy comes from the waves, suddenly the big ones are running up.
It is a non-perishable source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and only now do the world's major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and also looking to occupy, like giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years, and it is no coincidence that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When oil prices fell in 1980, the idea of marine energy was dismissed, but now environmental organizations and the rising oil price are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of global energy needs could be met by the energy produced by ocean waves.
This would be equivalent to twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there were currents and tides.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract to build a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies in the traditional energy sector are now relying on marine energy.
"Chevron is exploring these technologies", says a spokesman for a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, "and is considering working with us".
This is about obtaining approval from the U.S. Energy Commission to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that should not be underestimated, especially considering that oil is still being extracted in Alaska by the United States and that President Bush has just recently started plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; details are not known, but observers are saying there is increasing interest.
We have to make sure that we have the right to make the necessary changes.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its infancy, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been resolved.
So far projects like those in Portugal and Scotland are rather small and do not appear to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with far greater environmental impact are needed.
There are several ways: for example, Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer via piston and cylinder.
This one drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast via underwater pipes.
So far, there are four planned installations of this type, which are only awaiting state approval.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a department store and a parking lot using underwater turbines in New York's East River.
The water moves during the tides, which drives the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotational motion.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential customers is already waiting for the necessary authorisations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the waves.
The Institute for Electricity Research says that the potential of tides is of particular interest at the moment.
Although irregular, tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation, and waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It's the tidal energy that has driven states like New York, Maine and Alaska, and other coastal states to invest $7.5 million in 2008 -- up to $35 million is already planned for 2009.
