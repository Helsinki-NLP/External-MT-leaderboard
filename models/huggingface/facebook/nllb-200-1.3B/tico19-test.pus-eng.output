Total cases of rapidly spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases show similar incidence across the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, while at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly across all countries.
Based on the Italian experience, countries, hospitals and care units should increase their preparedness for the surge of COVID-19 patients who will require health care and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a case of syneumonia with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 20 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a novel coronavirus now known as Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence so far is that 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have a mild illness, e.g. respiratory distress from or without pneumonia, and most are healthy.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a very serious illness requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% of cases develop a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assessed the total incidence of COVID-19 cases in each EU/EEA country and the UK and compared it to Hubei Province, China.
We compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EV/EEA countries and the UK during 31 January 2020 to 15 March 2020 in Italy.
COVID-19 cases in England and EU/EEA countries
After China, COVID-19 spread geographically and the COVID-19 pandemic is now following the country dynamically in the rest of the world.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic a global pandemic.
In EuroSurveillance 2020, on 5 March Spiteri et al, reported the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported on 24 January 2020 in French-bound returnees from Hubei, China, and Wuhan.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, while 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported between 31 December 2019 and this date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported from Italy alone.
Total number of COVID-19 cases and cumulative incidents
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in every country in the world is counted, with only official sources such as the countries' health ministries, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) releasing it every day at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess COVID-19 incidents in the EU/EEA and the UK, and it is compared to Italy.
As an indication of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the 14-day decreased total incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020 in each EU/EEA country and the UK.
We presented the total number of confirmed cases per country at 8:00 on 15 March 2020 compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases from the UK and EU/EEA countries
This trend over 14 days was followed by the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases in EV/EEA countries and the UK, followed by Hubei Province (China) in general (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the total COVID-19 cases started to increase around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28 February 2020 (complete items).
This was largely due to the rapid increase in cases reported from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar increase in the total incidence of COVID-19 (complete materials).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in EV/EEA countries and the UK compared to those in Italy for the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
This indicates that, as of 8am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported similar cases to Italy just 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The intensity seen in the overall incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is making a comparative progress in all countries.
While countries are at different stages, there are differences in national public health responses, and countries may have different definitions of cases, different protocols for patient selection and follow-up testing that must be tested for COVID-19.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Documents of admission information in COVID-19 cases in hospital and/or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (information not shown).
However, they should be collected systematically to complement current surveillance documentation/records that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a large difference in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, with beds available per 100,000 population from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (care and intermediate care beds are 12.5 per 100,000 population in 2012-2010).
Modelling scenarios related to the centralisation of healthcare capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and UK hospitals of COVID-19 cases with a >90% risk of exceeding the capacity of the Concentrated Care Beds, were presented at the 6th ECDC.
As cases have so far been clustered in some regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and care unit units usually determine the regional incarceration population, information on cases and care beds should preferably be provided in the name of the regional units for the (NUTS-2) level.
Our experience from Italy shows that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and care units should thus prepare themselves for the continuing social spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, and especially intensive care, such as is occurring in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is needed to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, from a preventive to a mitigation approach, as the projected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to plan, adopt and implement their reflective response if not implemented early.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity while countries are likely to step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the healthcare burden.
Failing this, it is possible that the health systems of other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world.
Similar to this homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted by evening showers and cause similar illnesses through the same mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissible and affects older individuals than younger and more men than women.
In response to the rapid number of publications on chronic disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving topic of research.
We will cover the basics of disease prevention, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope this review will help understand and eliminate the threatening disease.
The 25 January 2020 Spring Festival has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been forced to stay indoors for the entire holidays and many weeks due to the outbreak of the new disease.
It is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that led to the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was renamed CoV disease-19 (COVID-19).
The disease originated in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to about 50 other countries worldwide.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 patients have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "class 1 enemy of the people" and is warily more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), in less than two months more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19 including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in a new and rapidly developing topic area.
Whenever possible, we will compare COVID-19 to another SARS-CoV-derived disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, published in 2012).
We will also discuss the prevention and diagnosis of this disease and some of the pressing questions we have learned so far.
CoVs have traditionally been recognized as non-lethal to humans, typically causing 15% of the common cold 4.
However, in this century, we have twice been exposed to highly pathogenic human CoVs, for example, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which actually caused outbreaks first in China in 2003 and then in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and soon spread to many other countries with a panic of disease and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third widespread outbreak of CoV in recorded human/human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a thoracic cluster of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later the CoV sequence was released.
The first fatal case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
At the same time, the disease quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, infections were reported by health care providers, suggesting human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, Wuhan was closed with all public transportation shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of the onset of the disease from an unidentified animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared it a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread to China and some 50 other countries around the world. (Fig. 2)
As the situation develops rapidly, the final scope and intensity of the spread will be further determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study of 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients including 8,866 patients provided a new updated description of the disease as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ULBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but most are in the age group of 30-65 years.
About half (47.7%) of infected individuals were over 50 years of age, a very small number were under 20 years of age, and only 14 of the infected patients were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected 0.27/100,000) more men (0.31/100,000) than women.
COVID-19 spread mainly in and around clusters in Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average duration of contamination was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The initial reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (%CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infections increased unprecedentedly before January 23, 2020, compared to the time of the Great Transmission before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate for patients with confirmed cases was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.10-1.86), and the mortality rate for all patients was 3.06 (59% 4-02.2: 95% CI).
The three risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60), and severe asthma.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and coated viruses that contain a single sensory RNA.
They can be divided into four types, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, from which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
Spec-pack (S) glycoprotein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and diptahedyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of these cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and subsequent membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is distributed in the cytoplasm; after the viral genome reacts, the genomic RNA forms virion-containing vesicles with envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which then pause to release the virus along the plasma membrane.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new variant of beta CoV with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% among 10 randomized samples collected from the Hunan sea market in Wuhan, the main area of spread.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MAR-CoV.
Through transmission balectron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the ultrasonic sections of the human air epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be receptors for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is much less strongly associated with human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form an unidentified short protein that is spread by orf3b and orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and take the IFNβ form; however, orf8 has no known active domain or form.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al, reported the cryo-EM structure of a full-length human ACE2 at a 2.9 Å contract in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conditions, is collected as a dimer and mixed with ACE2-B0AT1 that can block two S proteins, which provides evidence for CoV detection and infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug trials to bury SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Source and intermediate host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from evening primates and were transmitted to humans through cats and mice, respectively.
Through phylogenetic comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the evening sun was the original host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs known as -SL-CoVZX45.
However, what intermediate hosts helped the virus to break the species barrier to infecting humans, and the route of transmission is still unclear.
G, et al., suggested that the snake from the evening showers was a human-to-human virus carrier that was in the homologous group within the S protein.
Based on one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China suggested that pangolins - long-mouthed, mouse-eating insects often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in CoVs found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference in the spread of the two genomes is still a large difference; thus, results of true and accurate evidence are expected (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still not widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for up to 48 hours in a dry environment and can survive up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and temperatures at 56 °C for 30 minutes; or 75% ethanol, chlorine, disinfectant, paracetic acid, chloroform and nitroglycerin solutions, but chlorhexidine cannot effectively inactivate the virus.
The entire human population is generally not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to this unknown virus.
Currently, no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4) 4).
Typically, after the virus attacks a host, it is first recognized by the host's immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, all-type receptor TLR (NOD) -like receptors (NLR), and - (RLR).
In a variety of ways, the virus promotes a combination of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell complementation, and type I interferon (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the microfagusity of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the immune adaptation response is being combined in the fight against the virus.
T4 lymphocytes play an important role in the defense of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinephrine cytokines to aid immune cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell functions by promoting T cell apoptosis.
Neuronal immunity supplements and antibodies such as C3a and C5a are also essential against viral infection.
For example, the antibodies of a recovered patient replace MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, overworking the immune system creates locally large radicals that can severely damage the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, cause multi-organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 disease, which started with a cluster set, is more likely to affect older people, pregnant women.
It is normal for people who are infected with a large number of viruses or whose immune functions have been compromised, to have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 - 14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on an initial study of 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the duration of contractions was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is critical for health authorities to regulate effective quarantine times based on the effective timing of the rule, thereby preventing transmission of the virus from infected but asymptomatic people to others.
As a general practice, individuals who have been exposed or infected with the disease usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often a major and early symptom of COVID-19, which may be asymptomatic or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, joint/muscle pain, dizziness, headache, chest pain, diarrhea, vomiting/convulsion.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after onset of disease.
In severe cases, patients have rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed the percentage of claims was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for gout, and 3% for sinusitis.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster caused by transmission from a non-muscular patient.
Relatively, demographic studies in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of these require ventilation support, more than COVID-19 patients and corresponds to a higher mortality rate for MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26) and chest pain (21) were also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), sinusitis (20%-25%), and abdominal pain (13%) -25%) were major symptoms and that fresh air was needed for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
On February 14, COVID-19 deaths were 2% as confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally.
Relatively, SARS deaths in November 2002 were 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2's R0 was as high as 6.47 with a 5.71-7.23 95% interval (CI), while SARS-CoV's R0 was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV regarding their symptoms, mortality, and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmissibility than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Thus, the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Clustered initiation often occurs in the same family or in the same meeting or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients two weeks prior.
However, it has been reported that people can transmit the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and discharged patients can re-transmit the virus, which has led to delays in extending quarantine time.
Patients have normal or low white blood cell counts (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopathy with a white blood cell count <4 × 109/L, lymphocyte count 1 × 109/L, and high aspartate aminotransferase levels and vermia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Liver/blood and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels were elevated in the blood of liver patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte degradation were increased in the blood of many patients.
In patients with severe cases, levels of D-dimer, a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, are elevated, and the lymphocyte count gradually decreases.
Abnormalities in chest radiography have been detected in many COVID-19 patients and are obscured by the shadow of a bilateral patch in the lungs or a blurred right side of the earth.
Patients often develop neuro-thoracic, acute pulmonary trauma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and advanced fibrosis impair gas exchange.
Type I and type II pattern disorders decrease surfactant levels and increase surface pressure, thereby reducing lung capacity and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, poor chest radiographic findings often parallel the more severe stage of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathology analysis of COVID-19 was in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, with sinusitis, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multiple sinusitis cells, similar to the pathology of viral infections and ARDS and SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain interaction (RT-PCR) was used as a major benchmark for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to high error-negative rates, which may accelerate disease, clinical manifestations used for diagnosis (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) were used in China on February 13, 2020.
The same thing happened with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, combining disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, FengJang Group described a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for detecting SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 moles/L to 200 -18 10-18 moles/L (e.g. 10-100 copies per microcontroller) using a diptych in less than one hour without the need for a detailed instrumentation.
Hopefully, the new technique could dramatically improve sensitivity and ease if validated in clinical models.
Due to the lack of experience with unknown CoVs, clinicians can provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients while trying different therapies that have already been used or recommended to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
These treatments include current and potential treatment including antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from acquired patients, Chinese medicine, and psychosocial support.
Even plasma from the patients received was suggested to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory disease and failure are a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is important for symptom reduction and life saving and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, proper ventilation, and depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be assisted with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a cardiac stabilization technique used to treat life-threatening heart and breath shortening.
In addition, maintenance of electrical balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and maintenance of vital organ functions are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that the cytokine storm is caused by an overactivation of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a part of the systemic inflammatory response that is released by a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release many of the free radicals that are the major cause of ARDS and organ failure.
Immunity is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and toselazumab, an antibody to IL6, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immune treatments for cytokine storm include T-cell-guided immune response modification; inhibition of IFN-the, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; cytothenine signaling delay 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as an immunosuppressant, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids in high doses were not useful for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they may cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting prognosis.
However, short courses of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids have been recommended to be used with caution for severe COVID-19 patients.
As of writing, no antiviral treatment effects have been confirmed.
However, administration of the veins with Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, re-enrollment also showed possible prevention of other single-infected RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
On this basis, Gilead provided a center to China to conduct the pair of tests on SARS-CoV-2 patients, and the results are highly predictable.
In addition, baricitinib, antiretrovir α, lupinavir/retonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, inflammation, coughing, liver damage, and other adverse interactions may occur after co-treatment with lupinevir/retinoir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medications used for patients should be carefully studied.
Plasma and antibodies from patients received
The collection of blood from patients who have emerged from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent infection of healthy individuals has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies against the disease in their blood.
Antibodies are an immune force that is formed by B lymphocytes to fight disease and other foreign substances and thus recognize and directly neutralize specific molecules in such diseases.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with decreased inflammatory and viral stresses and increased oxygen concentration in the blood.
However, validation and clarification are necessary before specific treatments have yet to be developed to suggest a method for large-scale use.
Furthermore, given the therapeutic effects, some of the risks associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can enhance the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxin.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat serious patients.
Rapid production of specific antibodies to fight against a pandemic is expensive.
Thus, it is very important and practical to isolate B cells from infected cells and identify antibodies or test-coding or genetic codes that are effective against the essential proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can easily measure the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a range of ailments.
However, its effectiveness relies heavily on the combination of several components in the formula that underpin the diagnosis of disease based on the TCM theories.
Many active ingredients remain unknown or obscure because it is difficult to extract and verify the same ingredients or their preferred combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the major alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shen Feng Zi Du capsules and Lian Hu Qingwen capsules were found to be effective for treating COVID-19.
The best treatment rates in treating COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that use TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningya (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest treatment rate (13%).
However, this is somewhat comparative as many other influencing factors such as the number of patients and severity must be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Booli Jung and colleagues published a study to compare Western medicine (WM) treatment alone with WM and TCM combined treatment.
They found that the times required for body temperature recovery, symptom resolution, and hospitalization were much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
More effectively, the rate of symptomatic worsening (severe than light) for the WM+ TCM group was significantly lower for the WM-only group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the WM+ TCM group than the WM-only group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await well-controlled trials at large scale and other centers.
It will be important to identify the mechanism of action and identify the effective components of TCM treatments or, where possible, their combinations.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients often experience a greater fear of highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also experience fatigue, loneliness, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and adverse treatment effects such as insomnia induced by corticosteroids can cause increased anxiety and mental distress.
In the early stages of SARS, a range of psychiatric disorders including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic episodes, psychosis, heart failure, and even suicide have been reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, can make people more concerned and guilty about the impact of contagion, quarantine, and stigma on family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons, and people in contact with them, as well as the general public who are in need.
Mental support should include the establishment of multi-disciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 disease and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic tools and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are necessary to intervene in the transmission of a range of infectious organisms from animal stocks and infected humans and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in the control of disease caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been initiated to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and strong neutral antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-fed vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the efficacy of this vaccine candidate in elderly subjects and lethal challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection were still to be determined before clinical studies could begin.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have emerged since.
In contrast, cases and clusters of MERS variants occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions with continued zonotic origins in unusual regions.
A vaccination strategy has been developed for Mers using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vitriol, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and replicating protein subunits and some of these have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to eliminate problems because long-term (average 18 months) development of vaccines and dynamic variations of CoVs are required.
As an unknown disease, COVID-19 has only just begun to manifest its full clinical course across thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without surgery.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with higher morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.
Therefore, developing a diagnostic model for disease is essential for healthcare institutions to prioritize their services, especially in resource-limited areas.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may be associated with or influenced by the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also important for COVID-19.
COVID-19 is typically diagnosed in the 30-65 age group, with 47.7% of patients over the age of 50 in 8,866 cases studied.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have disorders and disorders and were significantly older than those who did not have a median age of 66 - 51 years, suggesting age as a prognostic factor for outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Disorders and disorders: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to have severe heart disease and arrhythmias.
Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver/liver damage in COVID-19 patients.
It is noteworthy that age and underlying disease are strongly related and may interfere with each other.
Laboratory abnormal findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injuries and has been suggested as a potential diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment, and eventual recovery.
The correlation of CRV levels with COVID-19 severity and diagnosis has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferases (AST), alanine aminotransferases (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, these are the traditional markers for cardiac or renal/liver dysfunction.
Major clinical signs: Chest radiography and the transient development of clinical signs should be considered along with other issues to predict the outcome and complexity of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants used as a treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids have been widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors have experienced isocular osteochondrosis with disability and poor quality of life throughout life.
Thus, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short duration in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have experienced extreme stress during the COVID-19 pandemic as they have often endured confinement and chronic uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and friends.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients return to a healthy and normal life from stress.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological symptoms from SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively induce a reaction in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or symptomatic symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stages or during the incubation period can develop large amounts of the virus during daily activities, creating a major challenge for disease control.
However, SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are very severely ill, while most transmission does not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, major efforts are underway in China, including the continuous quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities and nearly the entire population to disrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions are dramatically damaging the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new cases is declining, indicating the disease's severity.
The most optimistic forecast is that the pandemic will end in March and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.
Still, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al, predicted that COVID-19, which appears to be more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langney, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the outbreak and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both median turbinitis and colonic streams of patients who recovered and discharged from the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a flu-like cyclical event.
However, promising signs have occurred based on the declining number of new cases in China, suggesting that current strategies may work.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in infection and eventually die or remain a co-infection with humans.
Comparison of COVID-19 infection with SVS and Mers provided below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with virus-contaminated material.
The virus was also detected in human feces, raising the possibility of new oral-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were caused by potentially non-communicable diseases, including 17 more patients with other pre-existing diseases and 40 health care providers.
Thus, caution must be exercised when dealing with humans, especially when in contact with health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even sick or infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through wearing a face mask; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series # 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
A surgical face mask prevents droplets of potentially infectious fluid from traveling through the air or entering the surface of the material, where it can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against respiratory viruses small from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of viruses able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are about 85 nm.
Because particles can penetrate even five surgical masks together, health care providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear phytoseparation clothing to further reduce exposure to viruses.
Viruses can also make a person sick through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his burning eyes.
Thus, health care providers should also wear transparent face coverings or eyeglasses when working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is recommended that everyone wash themselves with pesticide soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors to protect themselves and limit contact with potentially infected people.
Staying three steps/foot away from the patient is considered appropriate distance for people.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came to the human world as a novel virus, its excellent homology to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have caused China to be on high alert due to its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of January 2020, the Directorate of Disease Control in Wuhan City reassures citizens by saying that the novel virus has a low and limited human-to-human transmission and is not a problem for disease prevention and control.
This message calmly eased public anxiety, especially as the entire country prepared for the Spring Festival, and missed important time to stop the outbreak, at least in Wuhan.
Disease control authorities in China may learn this hard lesson and make significant reforms in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is valuable to the public and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinicians rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) provide more restraint rather than relief to people for having a potential illness at the outset; and (4) more often conduct targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness about infectious diseases and periodically review and improve the community response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by the unknown virus SARS-CoV-2 that began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread to China and about 50 other countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the emergence of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS recurrence.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the treatment of the disease and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals more than younger individuals and more men than women, and severity and mortality rates are also higher in older individuals than in younger individuals.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (1.44% compared to 10.91%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have symptoms whereas SARS patients usually do so when they are severely ill, which makes it much more difficult to spread COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA assays for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, treated patients can then be positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, a number of important issues are still being addressed, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homologs have been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from the same co-parent.
Which animal was the intermediate that transmitted the virus from the original host to humans?
Without knowing the numerical answers 1 and 2, we cannot effectively reduce the transmission, and these events can reoccur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter air cells and subsequently cause pathological changes?
Has the virus also been implicated in other ACE2 expression cells in organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this disease continue?
How does this virus genetically evolve during transmission between humans?
Will it spread globally, die like SARS or emerge like the flu at the same time?
This is necessary but may take some time to search for answers to the above and many other questions.
However, at whatever cost it may require, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
Zoonotic origin/sources of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have for thousands of years created synergies between coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Before 2003, two human (HCoVs) were known to cause a communicable disease, such as the common cold.
The outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been minted as a token of how devastating and life-threatening it can be to be infected with HCoV.
The 2019 outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in central China has once again brought CoVs to the forefront and surprised us with its high transmission but reduced psychotic outcome compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
The HCoV infection is zoonotic and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs will serve us well.
Most HCoVs originate from the tropics where they are harmless.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs have also been identified.
Animal host identification has a direct effect on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals may also provide important insight into CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on their history of discovery and their primary sources of zones and cross-transmission.
Importantly, we compare different HCoVs by combining viral evolution and genome rearrangement.
The current outbreak of CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this section.
In addition, the requirements for successful hosts and the effects of virus evolution on disease severity were also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of spliced, positive-sensitive, or non-splicing RNA viruses.
These viruses, which have the largest genome in the group of RNA viruses at 26 to 32 kB and are called "CoVs" because of their crown-like morphology under the electrical microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have unclassified genomes that share the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large broad-envelope open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1 ~ 16
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Access proteins belonging to a chain are encoded by different numbers of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), in which the beta CoV genus contains most HCoVs and is divided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Polygeneetic evidence has shown that mice and rats serve as the gene source for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the primary reservoirs of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have been constantly overcoming various obstacles and some have emerged as major human diseases.
To date, seven human (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha CoVs.
The other five beta CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause a common symptom, such as the common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively high number of patients with a higher chance of developing upper respiratory tract disease.
The first HCoV-229E patient, B814, was isolated from the gross secretion of the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more data have been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept was widely accepted that being infected with HCoVs was generally harmless until the emergence of SARS.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is the most devastating outbreak in modern history, infecting more than 8,000 people with nearly 10% fatalities.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic caused a persistent infection in the Arabian Peninsula and spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel (HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
Alarms are sounding and the world must prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs are of zoonotic origin from swine, mice or domestic animals.
Evidence lines support the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from chimpanzees, where the viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show great genetic diversity
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented major medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracking the origin of HCoVs zones provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and limiting factors of species encoding.
This may facilitate the guidance or search for reservoir, intermediate and extended animal hosts (hosts) of SARS-CoV-2, which have important implications in preventing future spirochetes.
In this review we present the zoonotic origin, cross-transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we point out and discuss the common theme that HCoVs' parent viruses are specifically non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir host but become pathogenic after cross-transmission to a new host.
We also look at the evolutionary state of HCoVs in which increased transmissibility often comes with decreased disease.
The ongoing outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 in this regard are also under discussion.
Animal CoVs have been known since the 1930s.
Before the initial isolation of HCoV-229E B814 was detected in the respiratory tract of patients who had a normal human infection, various CoVs were isolated in various infected animals, including elephant chickens, mice, cows, bats, cats, and dogs.
In the last decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief history of HCoV detection in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of upper respiratory tract patients during 1966, and was later adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have symptoms of the common cold, including headache, nausea, chest pain, fever, and cough seen in 10 ~ 20 percent of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial translocation in the brains of lung mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which is in other areas not isolated from microbes with respiratory disease triad such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, and they are transmitted during the winter season in tropical climates.
Typically, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, with a duration/delay of about 2 weeks.
According to human volunteer studies, healthy individuals who were infected with HCoV-229E develop a common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed severe low respiratory system influenza.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first known HCoV-caused pandemic in human history and the etiological agent SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS was detected in Guangdong Province, China, in late 2002.
The SARS outbreak resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across several countries and continents.
In addition to the super-transmitters, each case was estimated to progress to approximately 4 secondary cases, with a incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a viral load-bearing manifestation by day 10 of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV first experience myelgia, headache, fever, aching and sickness, followed by dyspnea, coughing and respiratory distress as delayed symptoms.
Lymphonia, liver/blood function tests, and elevated creatinine kinase are common SARS laboratory abnormalities.
Reduced alveolar damage, increased epithelial cell growth and increased microfage are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation afterwards.
In addition to tight breathing, numerous organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver/gut and kidney can also be affected in these severe events, usually with a cytokine storm, which can be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from open lung biopsies of relatives of the INDEX patient who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, extensive efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old infant in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially detected in infants, adults, and patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of cholera, conjunctivitis, fever, and pulmonary germs is common in HCoV-NL63-induced disease.
Another independent study described an isolated case of basal virus in an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is known in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed internationally.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for approximately 4.7% of normal respiratory illnesses, with its highest incidence occurring in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with inhibitory laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and pneumonia in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute ischemic disease.
Similar to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing fewer respiratory illnesses.
All four community-acquired HCoVs are well-established in humans and are generally less likely to cause more serious illnesses, while the incidence is caused by unknown causes as is the case in more viral subtypes of HCoV-NL63.
Generally, when these HCoVs have acquired the ability to transmit efficiently and persist in humans, they also become less dangerous or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases have occasionally been reported in various European countries and Tunisia, with links to the latter being close.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, which is characterized by advanced acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed severe renal failure, which is more typical of Mers in HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30% of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and inflammation.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, with a high of 34.4%, making Mers-CoV the deadliest virus known to humans.
From mid to late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients associated with SARS-CoV-2 disease were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of global concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 3.4% of raw/unconfirmed deaths.
Significantly, the death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness similar to CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly variable due to the 82% high nucleotide sequence homology, they cluster in different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently a rare carcinogen but is more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveal several beneficial differences.
First, the incubation period and the HCoV pathogen are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four socially acquired HCoVs (e.g. HCoV-229E HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections show forms that are more common during exposure to community-acquired HCoVs, including presenting with a non-specific, mild or even non-existent symptom.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen in SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is somewhat lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting pathways that exhibit both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is much higher than that of at least community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 declines after transmission to humans as seen in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 must be detected in fecal samples.
However, ovarian oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as will be clarified by future studies in at least some cases in the case of SARS-CoV.
It is of particular interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 may have a seasonal explanation as in community-acquired HCoVs cases.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 variant will be influential for the eventual fate of ongoing COVID-19 after its transmission to humans, including infection and sustained spread.
Four community-acquired HCoVs that cause moderate symptoms have been well adapted in humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have shown good adaptation to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the previous HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and those humans that caused severe HCoV disease were eliminated.
For this to occur, HCoVs must replicate sufficiently in humans to allow for adaptable mutations that combat host restriction factors.
In other words, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the greater the chance that it will become fully recognizable to humans.
If it is well understood, its transmission to humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, community-acquired four CoVs have been circulating in the human population, becoming common in immunized subjects.
These viruses do not require animal stores.
In contrast, high-cancer SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well accepted in humans and their transmission to humans cannot continue.
They need to maintain and disseminate within their own zoological reserves and look for opportunities to promote suspicious human targets, possibly through one or more moderate and advanced hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has a morphology that is similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is as transmissible as community-acquired HCoVs, at least for now.
However, it is much less pathogenic/infectious than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it would serve us well to discuss the evolution, natural reserves, intermediates and propagation host definitions and characteristics of HCoVs.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host for HCoVs if it is related to close ancestors that share high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The old virus is often well known and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the reservoir host retains HCoVs continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the host is pathogenic and is either a natural host of HCoV or a parent of the virus.
Conversely, if HCoVs are introduced to humans with a new intermediate host before or around its introduction, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
These intermediate hosts can act as the zoonotic source of human infection and play a transitional role by transmitting the virus through and then to humans by expanding the human infection rate.
HCoVs can carry out a deadly infection if it cannot protect its transmission in the intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoVs can co-exist with intermediate hosts and even develop long-term immunity.
In this case, the intermediate host is the natural reserve host.
Looking at epidemiological data, it has been shown that SARS index cases have a history of animal contact.
Subsequent surveillance studies showed that animal dealers had higher levels of SARS-CoV IgG antibodies than the general population.
Masked sows (Pygoma larvata) and raccoon dogs in live animal markets were first known to transmit SARS-CoV-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that there were no further reports of SARS after all the enclosures in the market had been killed.
However, it was reported that masked fish from wild or farmed stocks without reaching animal markets were largely negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked poultry may only be moderate hosts but not natural reservoirs of CoV-SARS.
Significantly, since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that micro-virus species may also serve as hosts of a moderate SARS-CoV outbreak is high.
All of these appear to be hosts of SARS-CoV deaths.
A close-related CoV variant, SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3, which is present in Chinese Harshu Shopruks, was identified by the researchers looking for a natural host for SARS-CoV.
These drivers are positive for the genome sequence of SARSR-RH-BatCoV HKU3 and SARS-CoV antibodies.
These and other CoVs share a 92%-88% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the basis for the new idea that the cut-off site hosts a human-made corgi.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in the evening show, but none of them can be isolated as a live virus, with the exception of one virus identified as WIV1.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a receptor or receptor for SARS-CoV.
The fecal samples of the evening primates were sequenced in WIV1 which uses the virus as a receptor for evening primates, parasites and humans ACE2 to enter the cell.
It is noteworthy that serum or serum from recovering SARS patients was able to inhibit WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest-related SARS-CoV gene in the evening show, with 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Although there is a great deal of similarity between these two viruses, the general belief is that WIV1 is not the closest parent virus of SARS-CoV and that evening primrose is not the closest host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis and analysis classify MERS-CoV into the same group as evening primate CoV-HKU4 and evening primate CoV-HKU5.
Both MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV use the same host, dipoptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNAThe MERS-CoV-related sequence of RNA polymers is phylogenetically close to the homologous evening primate beta-CoVs known in Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoVs have been detected in wild evening showers.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative evening primate CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
So the evening primrose is probably not a close-closed host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that Arabian onions have positive outcomes for MERS-CoV-specific inhibitory antibodies, as have Middle Eastern onions of the palm tree in many African countries.
The kitten was isolated from the cooking fluid of Arabian rats, which is similar to the virus found in humans, suggesting that rats are the primary hosts of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that the MERS-CoV-infected mice for the experiment generally showed mild symptoms but had a more extensive viral transmission.
It is noteworthy that infected mice not only transmit the virus through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal mucosa, which is also the main route of transmission of the evening primrose virus.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with mosquitoes before the onset of symptoms, apparently attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown routes of transmission involving unidentified animals that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% nucleotide similarity to the evening-night CoV RaTG13 isolated from Renulphus affinis.
In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the range discrepancy or remoteness between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine a causal link.
This means that evening primrose is probably not a distant host of SARS-CoV-2 unless a nearby cut-off also of evening primrose coronavirus is detected in the future.
Presumably, the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2 must have been among the wild animals purchased and killed at the Hanan seafood wholesale market, where many of the early cases of COVID-19 were linked, indicating a potential event of transmission from animals to humans.
A number of recent studies based on the metagenomic series have suggested that endangered microorganisms known as honey bees (Manis yavannica) may also carry inherited beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These genomes of the new pangolin CoV have a nucleotide sequence of 85-92% homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are similarly more closely related to RaTG13 with nearly 90% similarity at the nucleotide chain level.
In their paleogenetic tree, SARS-CoV-2-like viruses are grouped into two subfamilies , one of which has a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
More distinctly, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, RBD are more differentiated, although having a genome-wide homology range.
An earlier study of infected apes also reported viral infection from lung samples, similarly associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different combinations and manual construction to produce a three-level genome sequence whose sequence is approximately 86.3% of the full-length of the viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the bee is one of the hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediates.
However, at present, there is no evidence supporting a direct origin between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 due to the differing sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and its beta-CoVs.
Furthermore, the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and its sister SARS-CoV-2 that is related to beta-CoVs.
The growth pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in reptiles, mammals and other animals has not yet been identified.
While a high range of homology has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and mouse-sister, SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs have a high level of genome-wide series homology between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.
It is widely speculated that the high degree of similarity between the mouse SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs and the SARS-CoV-2 RBDs is due to the increased preference mediation combination.
Another proposal then advocates re-generation between the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in third-generation wildlife species.
As a growth driver, re-generation among beta-CoVs is more widespread.
Judgment on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still far from certain.
Animal origin of the high-level pathogens HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phyllogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from mosquito CoVs, while the inherited HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 genes originated in a family of mice.
It has been reported that a mosquito CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in three North American mosquitoes has shown close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another mosquito-borne CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, found in Ghana, although there is also doubt as to whether it is an intermediate host in the mosquito family.
For clarity, a summary of the current available information on the origin of HCoVs is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Paleogenetic analyses have historically suggested evidence for the occurrence of HCoVs in animals.
When HCoV-OC43 from domestic animals came to humans around 1890, respiratory infections were recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E transmission between animals is poorly understood.
Spore alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been identified.
Among these is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
A number of different pieces of evidence support evidence of virus transmission between rodents and humans.
First, in the environmental realm, humans may have had contact with alpacas, not alpacas.
However, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, the swine alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are variants and do not cause nausea in swine, whereas the alpha-CoVs of alpaca have caused respiratory illness in infected animals.
As a result, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been detected in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas acquire HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, smallpox is a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies, Ebola, Nephthys and Handraviruses.
So it is not surprising that mosquitoes can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, while mosquito alpha-CoVs serve as a source of HCoV-229E's inheritance, mosquito alpacas and a mosquito genus may be intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, as demonstrated by the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV transmission from a mosquito to a human is a good example of animal-to-human transmission from a mosquito to a human.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from mice was identified early and supported by recent findings.
It is clear that the ability to transmit genetic material between animals is a rich source of viruses among animals.
Longevity, high population density, close social contact and strong flight ability are all supporting conditions that make ticks suitable vectors of the virus.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been transmitted to monkey cows over decades.
It has become well adapted to these animals from an intermediate host to a stable and natural resource.
MERS-CoV causes a very low rate of morbidity and mostly maintains a low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its uncontrolled transmission to humans is a phenomenon and humans are the final host of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the mammals' role in MERS-CoV transmission, the mammals' role, if any, in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, mammalian beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in mammals.
In the case of SARS-CoVs to cats' families, they may be one of the hosts of the end of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Different animal-to-human transmission possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 should be accepted or not accepted in future studies.
First, the SARS-CoV-2 related virus may be the source of a similar host close to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share a similar ecological area with the apes through butchering or mining for bricks.
Second, mammals may be a common intermediate host to which the SARS-CoV-2 related virus has recently been transmitted.
Humans are infected by butchers and by eating the flesh of prey.
Many animals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals is required for antibodies.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 recombination and adaptation may have emerged in tertiary animals that have been in contact with both mammals and mammals.
A search for animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is also underway.
Apart from the different host species, three virologically important factors are also important for the ease of transmission of CoVs to animals.
First, their high rate of mutation is most common in RNA regrowth.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of mutation of CoVs may range from "medium" to "high", with an average rate of mutation of ~10-4 per year per 2 sites, and this depends on the stage of the new host CoV.
CoVs have exoribonuclease correction, with removal resulting in high levels of mutation and reduced or no persistence.
Significantly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir has been identified to inhibit CoV replication through this exoribonuclease and RNA-binding RNA polymers.
Remdesivir is more promising for anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested clinically.
However, the rate of mutation of CoVs is almost one million times higher than that of their host.
In addition, the rate of mutation is higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
A higher rate of mutation, compared to SARS-CoV, is observed in SARS-CoV-2 with a lower rate of mutation, meaning a higher rate of adaptation with humans.
It may have been adapted from a nearby host similar to the proposed humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also relevant for MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the urine of a duck.
In theory, it is impossible that genetic mutation will render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective anytime soon.
Second, the large RNA genome transformation and recombination pathway in CoVs uses greater flexibility in genome transformation, as it increases the possibility of cross-species co-evolution, which is useful for the emergence of new CoVs when the conditions are right.
It supports 3′ encoded open reading frames at the end of the genome and more specific function of proteins.
Third, CoVs alter irregular and repeating templates during RNA reproduction through a specific "transcription selection" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a joint node, string mutation occurs frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
High levels of identical full-length and subgenomic RNA strains can be recombined to produce new CoV strains.
Natural recombinant paleogenetic evidence has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as swine SL-CoV and swine CoV-HKU9.
Transmission-related virus-hosted communication
In addition to the three viral agents mentioned above, animal-to-animal transmission is another important factor.
Therefore, SARS-CoV recombination has been taken as a common example, which has also shown evidence of positive selectivity during animal-to-animal transmission.
Based on comparative analyses between human and cat SARS-CoVs and SARS-CoVs, it is thought that in different strains, especially the S protein undergoes rapid adaptation to RBD mutations.
Typically, the S protein RBD of a CoV binds to a cellular receptor and is strongly picked up by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD in the S1 fragment is one of 318 to 510 amino acids that bind to human ACE2 and to receptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV, RBD can recognize ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including mice, cats, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing the virus to spread among animals.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues in RBD were distinct from humans and wild cats and 4 of them were located in the receptor-binding scheme for binding to the ACE2 receptor.
Cat SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of the human ACE2 receptor for spike protein binding.
In other words, mutations in these two amino acids may be important for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell-receptors as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit suggests that the human tendency to bind S protein to ACE2 may have changed.
Indeed, a cryo-EM study showed a 10 to 20 percent higher binding affinity, as long as it is between the human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to know whether any of the host organisms may be necessary for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with the same S-blue part.
There are several receptors for HCoV, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylsalicylic acid for HCoV-OC43.
After transmission from their animal host to animals, they may also be considered for successful adaptation of these CoVs.
In addition to cell receptors, the outcome of HCoVs' spread among animals is also governed by the need for another host and restriction factors.
The differentiation of these host proteins between human and natural source hosts of HCoVs such as rodents, monkeys, mice and humans may be a barrier to transmission between animals.
For HCoVs to spread successfully between animals, they must pass through host-need agents and eliminate host-restrictive causes.
Therefore, molecular drivers in this critical area of virus-host relationship still need to be identified and explained.
The use of advanced CRISPR technology may be useful for genome-wide randomization of SARS-CoV-2 host requirement and inhibitory factors.
Emergence of new HCoVs: Back to basics
More variants of the fungal CoVs provide more opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
Therefore, the HCoVs of the swine are the source of the HCoVs gene pool.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also contribute to HCoV growth and serve as two important steps in that sequence.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes is capable of drastically altering the viral enotype.
Among SARS-CoV companion proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related pathogens have been isolated but have been found to encode different ORF8 proteins.
The presence of a 29-nucleotide, a characteristic of SARS-CoVs, is found in the early isolates of human infectious diseases.
This removal isolates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a normal change in inducing host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with families of alpha and gamma-CoVs, where RNA-binding regions of RNA polymers have been found.
Back-synthesis positions have also been identified in nsp9, several nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV infection has experienced cross-combination among different families, which originated in a buck of Saudi Arabia.
In addition, re-combination events of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs re-combine with other animal CoVs in their non-natural structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to random mutation of viral genomes, largely as a result of selective induced stress, such as release of viruses by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full length ORF4 in HCoV-229E, due to the removal of two nucleotides.
While complete ORF4 can be seen in saliva and urine viruses related to HCoV-229E, the inclusion of Alpaca alpha-CoV shows an individual nucleotide, resulting in mutation.
As a result, the growth of new HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure within their host strains.
Asymptomatic disease or only mild disease is detected when the ticks are infected with CoVs, indicating cohabitation between CoVs and ticks.
It appears that the larvae are automatically and physiologically well adapted to CoVs.
For example, inhibition in the pathogenic response function in mice actively reduces the pathogenic activation by CoVs.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in algae is inhibited by the inhibitory activity of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low level primary equivalence class I molecules.
In addition, high-level reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the high metabolic activity of algae can both prevent CoV replication and the corrective effects of exoribonuclease, as it provides a protective pressure to replicate when a more pathogenic virus is transferred to a new host.
Most pathogenic CoV viruses can mutate by recombination, taking on new proteins or protein forms to adapt to the host.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are either non-pathogenic or cause rare disease in their host host host such as feces and urine.
They reproduce quickly without a robust response from the host security system.
Because there is a mystery to why asymptomatic cases are seen and what causes severe cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are primarily due to the high activity of the immune response and the cytokine storm, i.e. the stronger the immune response, the more lung damage.
In other words, the immunity response in asymptomatic patients is isolated from the reproduction of the CoV.
A similar isolation strategy of the immune response may have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response is particularly strong in mice.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at an early stage of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be useful.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in mice has complications.
With this argument, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat beta-CoV was found to share 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat-CoV that shares 96% nucleotide structure with SARS-CoV-2.
While cats and other animals in the market have been found to carry viruses similar to SARS-CoV, an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Bee-like beta-CoVs were found to be more similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that bee-eaters may be intermediate hosts or that bee-like beta-CoVs may be involved with gene fragments in the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 samples.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally synthesized by humans.
CoVs have become common once again due to the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies of CoVs in reptiles and other animals have significantly altered our understanding of the transmission of HCoVs to humans and the importance of stocks and animal origin in animals.
Overall evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the original strain and are transmitted to humans through intermediate vectors.
Given that the SARS-CoV virus is likely to have originated from human-cat interactions in markets, closing wet markets and killing cats could have effectively eradicated the SARS outbreak.
Based on the same reasoning, mammalian beta-CoVs should be withdrawn from wet markets to prevent animal transmission, as mammalian beta-CoVs are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and a number of similarities have been found.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans via mammals or other animals will have to be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been present in one-toothed pigs.
These waters serve as an important source for the local people for transportation as well as a central source of meat, milk, leather and poultry products.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all water to control MERS, as was done in wet markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the re-spread of MERS, a holistic approach should be adopted to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV, among other measures of control of spread for mosquitoes.
Since we cannot eradicate the virus, new genotypes can emerge and cause spread.
There are many varieties of CoVs in the wild.
CoVs, especially of the swine, have a higher variation with animal potential.
There is a high potential for these animal CoVs to mutate and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal in humans in the future.
In some places in China, wild animal-eating cultures should be avoided to reduce the need for contact between humans and animals.
A preparedness and response plan should be developed for the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 outbreaks.
In fact, there have been many viruses in the world for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until the opportunity arises to disperse.
Although bats have many features that help spread viruses, the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife can be reduced if people are advised to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of animals is necessary to gain an understanding of the environment of CoVs and the natural environment of the corals, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission in future outbreaks.
Consequently, a more effective way for humans to avoid animal viruses is to stay away from the environmental range of natural reserves of animal viruses.
Several pieces in the mystery of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if mammals transmit the inherited SARS-CoV-2 to apes, it would be interesting to see to what extent mammals and apes can share the same environmental domain.
Second, if ticks are directly involved in human spread, it must be understood how humans come into contact with ticks.
Third, if a third animal acts as the primary intermediate host, how it interacts with various animals including humans, reptiles, and mammals, should be clarified.
As a result, since many animals including domestic animals may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental spread should be undertaken.
Whether it is a mouse, a bee or another animal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its closely related inherited viruses will be identified in their natural host in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will shed light on the pathways of SARS-CoV-2 growth in animals, which will be important in the prevention and control outcomes of COVID-19 in humans.
Update of the diagnostic criteria data of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, we published a quick advisory guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic, and this guide offers our experience and better information for dealing with this common pandemic worldwide.
However, with the 2019 (COVID-19) coronavirus a new disease, our understanding and knowledge is increasing steadily based on the experience of ongoing research findings and clinical work; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we asked for an opinion on our guidance and proposed a new diagnostic criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases", based on the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (eighth version), issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began to spread, currently officially named Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was renamed Severe Acute Respiratory Disease Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a public pandemic.
To combat the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, our team has developed a rapid consultation guide and on 06 February 2020 it was published online in Military Medical Research.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
But remember that COVID-19 is a new disease, based on ongoing research findings and clinical work experience, our awareness and knowledge is constantly increasing; so diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), as of January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, have released a total of seven versions with some parts significantly modified.
Now that our guides have got an idea from Zhou et al, they have suggested a score that is based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and is valuable information for this common infectious disease.
We acknowledge their hard work and express our gratitude.
However, their work data should also be updated with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines and studies for COVID-19 (Testing Version 7).
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), a suspect case must combine a diagnostic history of infectious disease with two items of clinical evidence to form an all-encompassing analysis, or must meet three items of clinical evidence if no apparent diagnostic history of infectious disease is available.
History of contagious disease: (1) in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or in nursing communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the past 14 days prior to the onset of the disease; (2) a history of travel or residence; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 transmission cases (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) with patients in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or in nursing communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the past 14 days prior to the onset of the disease who had a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms; (4) a history of ≥ 2 cases in a group of confirmed cases with contacts with nursing/midwives, such as a small office, school, or other community in the area, including 2 weeks at home.
Clinical signs: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) infection with visual COVID-19; (3) normal, decreased white blood cell count, or decreased lymphocyte count in early onset.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be case-based based based on one of the following elements of pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing that shows high similarity to the novel coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibody in serum testing and specific IgM antibody for SARS-CoV-2; or positive from negative to positive specific IgM antibody for SARS-CoV-2, or ≥4 material elevation in the recovery phase to that in the critical phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples has been added in the second (18 January 18) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogenic identification of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and serological evidence was then added in the eighth edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to investigate high-level nucleic acid detection kits for early diagnosis, and to take blood samples from the respiratory tract, which added the availability of differentiated samples, and supported the delivery of unique positive results in the validated standard.
In addition, there is additional evidence that we should treat both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with caution.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. work map data should be updated, as those without clinical symptoms were classified as "low risk".
The scoring system must also be validated in other clinical work and studies.
As a result, we hope to see more conclusive evidence and ask readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend that you follow and comply with the new guidelines of your countries.
Our team has updated its guidance to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five more deaths from Covid-19, the highest number of deaths per day.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in one day there.
Yesterday, Bangladesh's Epidemic Disease Control and Research Agency (IEDCR) released a report on the number of people who have not been infected with the coronavirus, including 114 who have so far been infected with the virus, and 33 who have not recovered from the disease and remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr Mirjadhi Sabrina Flora said the dead included four men and one woman.
Dr Meerjady said that two of the deceased were over sixty years old, two were 51 to 60 years old and one was 41 to 50 years old.
She also said that two of the victims were residents of Dhaka.
The World Health Organization declared a pandemic of COVID-19 on 11 March 2020.
Hospital officials told Anadolu News Agency that one of the dead was Jalaj Saif Rahman, the chairman of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was at Kuwait Metro Hospital.
In an online video on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Roads and Bridges, Abid al-Qadir, said public transport would be closed for longer than previously announced.
The first public transport was shut down on March 2 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
But the transportation of essential goods such as medicines, fuel and food was still open.
Covid-19 cases in Bangladesh were reported on March 8, which included two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one person.
The three were later recovered on March 19.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 infected people worldwide has exceeded one million.
Johns Hopkins University data on Thursday showed that SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections have exceeded one million worldwide.
At least 52,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The target came on the same day as the first coronavirus case in Malawi and the first coronavirus death in Zambia.
North Korea claimed on Thursday that it is one of the few countries free of coronavirus infection.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, of which 79,332 occurred before 10am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, there have been no more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus, including at least 5,900 deaths.
According to CBS News, based on data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 people died in the United States on Wednesday from the coronavirus pandemic.
Around the world, several countries have taken drastic measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the quarantine period until May 1.
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says Russians will be paid at home by April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of extending the state of emergency for another 15 days; 215 voted in favour of the state of emergency and one voted against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the resort towns of Mecca and Medina to last until the end of the day; previously the curfew was from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew from 10pm to 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike D. Wayne announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order through May 1.
Stores in Australia lowered the toilet paper limit
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian retail chain Woolworths & Cools relaxed restrictions on the sale of toilet paper, which is two or one pack at a time nationwide in all stores.
ALDI also introduced a single-payer limit on Monday.
The limits were imposed in the form of alerts on exit logins and the channel's Facebook page.
According to the report, buyers were fearful of being quarantined due to COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also cut the purchase limit for toilet paper for the house by one batch.
These changes came after the four-stroke-at-a-time system introduced by Woolworth and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
In a March 8 media report, Coles said that the four packages were limited, "most stores sell out within an hour of arrival" and called the order "unprecedented", while Aldi called it "unprecedented" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
A Woolworths spokesperson said sales had "increased significantly" last week.
Costco Store in Canberra also limited the allowable quantity to two last week.
To reduce shortages, Coles requested larger packages and increased supplies from suppliers, Woolworths ordered extra stock, and Aldi otherwise provided stock for a planned special Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive chairman of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but that was difficult because of the time restrictions on routes by the local council.
He expects production prices to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand and what is specific.
On Tuesday, Aldi announced that after the stock expired, some stores that ran special Wednesdays could not.
Dr Gary Mortimer of the Queensland University of Technology says in a report on News.com.au that stores are filling up every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a large commodity, and is in short supply, and when sold, it empties into large cabinets, creating a sense of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that Close and Woolworth have an idea that if there are too many items in the closet, and if there are too many things like toilets and sanitary towels, then there may be less risk.
The recycled toilet paper market was running out of stock on Wednesday.
Kimberly-Clark, the manufacturer of Clinics toilet tissue and Solaris Paper Sorbent, quoted Bandi as saying that they worked 24/7 to restore the supply.
Real estate site Domain.com reported that Melbourne property workers gave away toilet paper to first bidders at the auction, with a series of auctions due to the lack of time for Labor Day.
The eighth issue of Darwin's newspaper, The Thursday News, was printed on toilet paper.
The Australian BBC reported on 3 March that the stores were not in favour of the restrictions, and there were no plans to ban the purchase of items.
Russell Zimmerman added that demand for other items is also high, including masks, sanitizers, dryers, handwashes, and flour.
Similarly outside Australia, the British online supermarket Bandai on Sunday saw Andrews toilet paper purchase 12 roll packs.
The World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 virus a global pandemic.
The World Health Organization on Wednesday declared an outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
If the word epidemic is too much of a disease, not enough of a dangerous event, the World Health Organization has ordered governments to take action.
All countries can still change the duration of the pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Chebreyesus said that if countries responded by detecting, testing, treating, and vaccinating their own people, they would be alone.
We are very concerned about the fact that many households are not taking action against the disease at a dangerous rate and intensity.
Former U.S. Director of Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Tom Friedan called the outbreak "unprecedented".
He said in an analysis published by CNN in February that this is the only influenza virus that has spread globally.
Gibrisos also expressed his analysis, saying that MONG has not faced an epidemic like the coronavirus.
He said that Mong had not seen an outbreak that could be contained at the time.
With the new pandemic situation, the World Health Organization decided in January to declare the pandemic a global public health emergency.
The head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the epidemic would worsen at the tail end.
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that more than 4,600 people have died of the coronavirus out of a total of 1,260,000 people who were not infected.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuation of the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic, which is caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and was declared a public health emergency in the country on December 30 due to international concerns, and was declared a global pandemic again on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, an estimated 1.60 million cases of coronavirus have been reported in 210 countries, resulting in over 97,000 deaths.
Already 364,000 people have recovered from the disease.
The mortality rate was recorded at 4% in China, and 13.04% worldwide, followed by .08% in Algeria and New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, dry cough, and fatigue.
Serious and complex symptoms include pneumonia, multiple respiratory arrest, and multiple organ failure resulting in disability or death.
Symptoms usually appear within five days of the onset of the disorder, but in some cases take two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or treatment for the novel coronavirus.
While first-line treatment and patient care are helpful, recommended precautions are important, such as hand washing, holding hands when coughing, social distancing, and self-isolation.
Authorities around the world are implementing laws such as travel restrictions, quarantines, tourism, workplace risk control.
The pandemic has created severe wage and economic disruption around the world, resulting in widespread reductions in the number of sports, religious, political and cultural events and the transmission of fear.
Universities and schools have been closed on a national or local basis in all 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of students worldwide.
Online references to the virus were shared, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, including people of East and Southeast Asian descent, and areas of high incidence.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced due to shortages of transportation and closures of major factories.
On 31 December 2019, a case of syneumonia with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The increased incidence is linked to Huanan seafood and the virus is said to be of zoonotic origin.
The pandemic virus known as SARS-CoV, a newly discovered virus, is closely related to the SARS-CoV, the pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV, the first person to be infected on 1 December 2019 was not associated with this wet cluster market.
Two-thirds of the first reported cases in December 2019 were found to have been linked to Marquette.
In China, an unconfirmed report in the South China Morning Post newspaper said that 55 cases were detected in the province of Hubei on 17 November 2019, while on 26 February 2020, the WHO reported a decline in cases in China, but an increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea.
Cases may be underreported, especially in cases with minor complications.
On 26 February, fewer cases were reported among adolescents, with young people aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of the world's cases, UK Chief Scientific Officer Patrick Valance estimated that 60% of the UK population should be immunised before the pandemic.
The number of cases refers to the people who have been tested for COVID-19.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, with most countries having a policy of not testing in the laboratory for those with lowest symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
According to a study released on March 16, 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected as of January 23 and that non-sand infection was the source for 79% of cases.
According to a statistical analysis released on March 30, the number of coronavirus cases in Italy is much higher than reported.
The baseline production figure for the initial COVID-19 measurement is from RO 1.40) to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests it could be 5.7.
Many people are getting sick from COVID-19.
The incubation period for non-recoverable deaths is 6 to 41 days, and for the most common cases it is 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97.000 billion deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, 80% of deaths as of February 5 were in people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing cardiovascular disease and diabetes, generally before the official COVID-19 deaths protocols for testing positive.
It is possible that the actual number of deaths from COVID-19 is higher, as this will not include those who died without testing, for example in homes or nursing homes and other places.
Preliminary data from Italy shows that the number of deaths from COVID-19 is 5x-4 higher than the official deaths.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that the death toll was low, with the Anonymous report previously confirming a low number in the U.S., such a low figure in epidemics, such as the H1N1 Swine flue outbreak in 2009.
The first deaths outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first deaths outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
28 February Dozens of deaths were recorded outside mainland China, in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories and every continent except Antarctica had reported deaths, with more general measures being taken to measure deaths.
These figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of health care, treatment options, time after the first case, and demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and general health, with the case-to-death ratio reflecting the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given time period.
According to Johns Hopkins University figures, the global mortality rate as of April 10, 2020, is 6.0%.
This number varies by region.
The mortality rate in China has decreased from 17.3% of those with symptoms (as of January 1, 2020) to 0.7% (as of February 1, 2020). Other measures include the case fatality rate ((CFR), which reflects the percentage of those who died from the disease, and the case incidence rate ((IFR), which indicates the percentage of those who died from the disease (diagnosed and undiagnosed).
The sensation has no time limit and can follow a specific population from infection to resolution.
Some scientific institutions have attempted to use these figures for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Medicine has assessed the evidence-based prevalence rate for the epidemic to be between 0.1% and 0.39.
The highest level of this range in Germany is the recurrent diagnosis of COVID-19, and a statistical study is measuring the effectiveness of the diagnosis on CFR.
The World Health Organization has stated that the epidemic is controllable.
The frequency and timing of the disease is variable and the location varies according to the occasion.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University says that uncontrolled infections generally begin to flare up and decline when the disease passes from an existing host.
But it's impossible to make any intelligent prediction now of what or when it will happen.
Senior Chinese government medical adviser zhong Nashan argues that this will be over by June, if all countries follow the advice given by the World Health Organization to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Typical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 could potentially be eradicated in one to two years.
Neil Ferguson in the Imperial College study says that it would have been necessary to maintain social distancing and other precautions "until a vaccine is available (approximately 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus - because it is so infectious - will disappear completely and it is possible" to become a seasonal disease, returning every year.
The return of the virus will depend on the extent of immunity and mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively undetectable and patients may be asymptomatic.
The two common symptoms are 88% fever and 68% dryness.
A few common symptoms include fatigue, nausea, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, chest pain, headache, cancer, canker, hemostasis, piques, or sciatica. The World Health Organization says that one in six people get sick and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a list of emergency symptoms that include respiratory problems, chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty getting up, and wheezing on the face or shoulders. These symptoms are recommended for immediate medical attention.
These patients may not have any symptoms or medical symptoms, but the diagnosis will reveal the disease, advising that those who have been in close contact with patients should be monitored and tested for infection.
China has a 44 percent incidence rate of asymptomatic disease.
The time between exposure and contamination was 14 days, more than 5 days, in which case the non-European situation is that the sense of smell in COVID-19-infected persons is 30 percent and the normal is 15 percent.
Some explanations for how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The first disease is spread by contact with people, such as droplets in the air, openings, or by talking to people within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The findings suggest that open-air coughing can transmit the virus from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some suggest that the virus may also be transmitted as tiny droplets in the air because it stays in the air for hours, which does not leave the air during speech, respiratory droplets are also produced during breathing but when spoken, the viral vector is not naturally found in the air.
These droplets may be injected into the mouth or nose of nearby persons or may travel into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) also aerolyzed and released respiratory fluids into the air.
The virus can also be spread by touching the eyes, urine, and mouth when in contact with contaminated surfaces, including the skin.
There is also concern that the disease is spread through waste, but this risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 is contagious.The virus is most transmissible within three days of the onset of symptoms, although it is possible that it can spread before the onset of symptoms and the final stages of the disease.
People who tested positive for the disease three days before the onset of menopause are likely to be transmitted before significant symptoms develop.
There have only been laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic case reports, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three others.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, in board card for one day, and in copper for up to four hours.
However, it varies based on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, as well as other surfaces that may have been linked to the disease.
Severe and acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel virus that was first isolated from three patients with acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan.
All of the viruses of the novel SARS-CoV-2 occur in nature in the corresponding coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by the family soap, which breaks down its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS.
The virus is said to have originated in animals.
Genetic analysis indicates that the coronavirus clusters together genetically with two double-stranded strains in the subgenus Sarbac virus (S.B.) of the beta coronavirus genus.
It is 96% identical to the other batch coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the total genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference between penguins and viruses from humans in some parts of the genome sequence.
A comparison of the complete genome with a relatively 92% of the material to date found genetic material shared between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove the pangolin to be the intermediate host.
Viral infection can be diagnosed briefly based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately by polymerase chain reaction of the infected products or compensation of CT images.
A study comparing PCR with PCR in Wuhan suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its reactions being overshadowed by other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for first-line testing or screening to diagnose COVID-19".
The World Health Organization has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, first published on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transition polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on breath or blood samples.
Results are usually available in hours to days.
Typically this test is performed on a nasopharyngeal swab while a column swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies run serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been proven accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
The serological test developed by Celix in the United States is only approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Imaging features in radiographs and computed tomography (CT) that are symptomatic include disproportionate peripheral grade epilepsy and absent optimistic factor
The Italian Society of Radiologists maintains an international online database of reaction findings for confirmed cases.
Due to the prevalence of other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by PCR has limited specificity in detecting COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT results to PCR and revealed that although the response is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its importance as a screening tool in epidemiological areas.
Strong artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect viral interactions with both radiographs and CT.
Strategies for preventing transmission of disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, prohibiting hand-washing with hands, nose and mouth, and coughing or sneezing and throwing tissue directly into a waste container.
Those who may already have the infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been proposed to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted or advised all non-essential travel to countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a stage of spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus spreads in communities, and some members of the community do not know where and how they became infected. Health care providers are looking for someone who may use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact confirmation is an important method for health authorities to identify the source of the disease and prevent further transmission.
Privacy concerns have been raised by governments using location data from mobile phones for this purpose, with Amnesty International and 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on such surveillance in a statement.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or offered for tender use, and from April 2020 to 20 expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to connect users to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Misinformation is spread about how to prevent the disease. For example, nasal decontamination and mouthwash are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although several organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or coughing.
Because it is outside the human body, the virus is killed by the family soap, which breaks its own protective bubble.
The CDC further recommended using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.
The World Health Organization advises people not to touch their eyes, nose or throat until they have washed their hands.
The face can be disinfected with a number of solutions (expose the stainless steel face to a disinfectant for at least one minute) containing up to 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone iodine.
Other solvents such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate are less effective.
The CDC recommends that any office or other premises where there is a suspected or previous case of coronavirus be disinfected, including all rooms, toilets, common areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, typewriters, remote controls and ATM machines that are in use.
Health organizations recommend that when coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with a garment or a bandage and then immediately remove the garment.
Surgical anesthesia may be recommended for individuals who are infected with the virus but who are not able to cough, sneeze, or speak due to the enlargement of their airway and reduced ability to travel.
The World Health Organization recommends when and how to use masks.
According to Leeds University virologist Stephen Graven, wearing a mask can reduce people's contact with their faces, but not washing hands properly is the most common cause of gout.Masks may also be recommended for individuals who care for and care for sick individuals.
The World Health Organization advises wearing masks to those who are at high risk, such as those who care for COVID-19 infected people and who also acknowledge that wearing masks can prevent them from touching their faces.
Many countries have launched public campaigns to encourage the use of masks in public.
In the United States, the CDC has recommended wearing non-textile medical face masks. China has advised that non-textile medical face masks be worn by particularly healthy individuals and then when they are in close proximity to other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has advised surgical masks when travelling on public transport or staying in crowds.
Thai health authorities are encouraging the public to make a cloth face mask in their homes and then wash it daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from leaving without a mask or a mask.
On March 16, Vietnam urged all citizens to wear a face mask when leaving to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone to enter the shops, so face masks are a must.
Israel has ordered all citizens to wear face masks in outdoor areas.
Taiwan, which has been building 10 million trains a day since mid-March, has forced the roll-out of the train on passengers on Hurghada and inter-city buses on 1 April.
Panama has assumed that it will require the use of face masks when going out and has already advised those who cannot afford masks to prepare masks themselves at home.
Facial masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves the practice of controlling mosquitoes in order to reduce the spread of disease by reducing the proximity of individuals.
The measures include quarantines, travel restrictions and closures of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, exhibitions and markets.
Individuals should practice self-isolation by staying at home, reducing travel, avoiding meeting, avoiding greeting and avoiding other people.
Many governments are mandating or advising quarantine in areas that have not been affected by the disease.
The population increase by the US government and health organizations was immediately reduced from 250 people (if there was no COVID-19 outbreak in the area) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On March 22, Germany imposed a ban on gatherings of more than two people, with older adults and those undergoing treatment for diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and a weakened immune system at increased risk of serious illness, as the CDC advised more stay-at-home at the point of epidemic.In late March 2020, the WHO and other health agencies changed the term "social distancing" to "physical distancing", with the intent of reducing physical contact, whether authorized or at a distance.
The term "social distancing" implied that it was to place people in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging others to interact with each other in a way that some officials even recommended sexual health during an epidemic.
Specific recommendations include having sex with someone you live with, someone who is not infected with the virus and has no symptoms of the virus.
Special home isolation is recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who are suspected of having the disease.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidance for appropriate isolation.More governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine in the affected area.
The more stringent self-quarantine guidelines have been applied to high-risk groups.
Those who have been in contact with non-infected persons with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where the spread of the virus is high are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days after that.
Prevention and reduction in the spread rate are included in the policy of epidemic control.
Virus containment is done in the early stages of an outbreak to diagnose and isolate those infected with the virus, as well as to determine the level of disease control and vaccine-related aspects to prevent further spread of the virus.
When disease becomes uncontrollable, efforts are made to reduce the incidence: measures are taken to reduce the spread and limit the impact of the disease on the community and health system.
It is also possible that both the containment and mitigation phases of the disease can be achieved together.
Elimination requires more drastic measures to reduce epidemics to a baseline incidence of less than 1. One part of managing an outbreak of a pandemic is to try to lower the spread graph of an epidemic, called the outbreak graph threshold.
This lowers the risk level for health services that have been eliminated and provides additional time for other therapeutic services and vaccine development.
Non-pharmaceutical measures that can control the spread of the virus include individual protective measures such as hand washing, wearing a mask, and self-quarantine; and social measures that include social distancing such as: closing schools and cancelling large gatherings; and community acceptance of and participation in these restrictions; as well as sanitary measures such as cleaning surfaces. When the severity of the virus outbreak became apparent, China took all the strictest measures to limit the spread of the virus, such as complete urban quarantine and strict travel restrictions.
Other countries also took various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea asked all its people to implement pre-quarantine and issued strict warnings for the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who had self-quarantined and fined those who had not.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and fined healthcare monopolies.The similarities between the UK and the US show that there are significant challenges in terms of virus mitigation (reducing the spread rather than stopping it) and virus eradication (preventing the spread of the epidemic).
A virus mitigation policy may reduce the demand for health services by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still hundreds of thousands of lives could be lost and health services could be lost.
Elimination of the virus may be best if it continues as long as the virus is available in the population (and if a vaccine is developed before then, this phase should continue for the same period), but if measures are stopped it will soon return the virus.
Long-term restrictions on eradicating the virus lead to social and economic damage.
There is no specific antiviral drug for COVID-19, but development efforts are ongoing, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking fever medication, drinking fluids, and resting may help reduce the symptoms of the disease.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the use of synthetic oxygen, serum, and respiratory strength is necessary for the patient's health.
Steroid use can lead to worse outcomes.
Many compounds that were used for other viral diseases have also been investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization said that some "home and family treatments" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization has outlined capacity and health care measures for COVID-19 patients.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have set guidelines for the provision of facilities to hospitals, primary care facilities at various levels, including increased focus on laboratory COVID-19 diagnosis.
Many theories are also possible that a disease called zero disease could occur.
The first positive case of coronavirus was reported on December 1, 2019, in Ube, Wuhan, China.
In Hubei, the number of coronavirus cases increased gradually over a month.
The most cases were linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where live animals are also sold, and there is a theory that the virus originated from these animals, in other words, the zoonotic origin, which was brought to light on December 26 due to an unidentified pneumonia cluster and was reported to the WHO.
On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan General Hospital alerted their colleagues to the SARS coronavirus.
The eight doctors, including Le Win Liang, were charged with lying to police and disgracing the leaders of the Ba'al Al Fatah.
The Wuhan Municipal Hospital Commission issued a public alert and the World Health Organization issued a warning on December 31.
An unidentified case of pneumonia in Wuhan last January led to a report to health authorities for full investigation that, at the beginning of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled to one every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, including the China New Year Immigration Transportation Center in Wuhan and the Giant Railway Exchange.
On January 20, China reported 140 cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later, official data showed that 6,147 people had developed symptoms as of 20 January 2020.On 26 March, the United States and China were the first countries in the world to report the highest number of cases, with over 1.61 million cases reported globally on 9 April 2020, with over 97,000 deaths and over 36,400 recoveries.
There is at least one case in about 200 countries and territories.
In Europe, the spread of the epidemic was recognized as free in most countries in the Schengen area and controls on the poles were tightened.
Nationally, enforcement measures include curfews (such as a curfew, stay-at-home order or lockdown) and tourism, as of 2 April, approximately 300 million people, or 90% of the population, are under some form of lockdown in the United States, 50 million people are under lockdown in the Philippines, approximately 59% of the people in South Africa and 1.3 million people in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, rising to 2.6 billion people two days later - a third of the world's population.
The first known case of coronavirus was reported on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, China.
On 31 December 2019, a case of syneumonia with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 27 December 2019, initial genetic tests of patients confirmed the presence of the coronavirus in the form of SARS-like virus.
The Wuhan Municipal Hospital Commission issued a public alert and the World Health Organization issued a warning on December 31.
The World Health Organization was informed immediately.
When the outbreaks occurred, Wuhan police warned doctors about spreading rumors of an outbreak.
Earlier, China's National Health Commission claimed that there was no clear evidence that the virus was transmitted from human to human.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a grassroots campaign, later dubbed the People's War by Communist Party of China General Chairman Xi Jinping, involving the spread of the virus.
In Wuhan's quarantine, the largest in human history, a sanitation belt was established on 23 January that stopped all travel to and from Wuhan, and then extended the quarantine to 15 other cities in Hubei, affecting approximately 57 million people.
The use of private carriages was also banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in most places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hossein Shan Hospital, which was built in ten days.
Another hospital was later established, named Li Shen Shan, to care for additional patients.
In addition to the construction of new hospitals, China converted 14 other service locations in Wuhan into temporary hospitals, such as: Association Centres and Stadiums.On 26 January, the Chinese government also took some other measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, such as: health alerts for travelers and extending the spring holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions specifically implemented a number of measures related to schools and universities.
Remote working measures were also implemented in many areas of China.
Restrictions were imposed on solo travel and travel to the Hubei region.
Public transport was restricted and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement was controlled in most cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half of the total population) were subject to exit restrictions.After the virus outbreak reached global levels in March, Chinese authorities implemented containment and severe measures to prevent the virus from entering China from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day emergency quarantine for all international travelers.On March 3, only one person had been transferred from Istanbul to Guangzhou in the past five days across China.
On 3 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that the spread of the virus from overseas to China had stopped and the outbreak of the virus in China was under control.
On the same day, travel restrictions across the Hubei region except for Wuhan were lifted after a two-month ban.On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Foreign Minister announced that visa and residence applications would be suspended from 28 March, but did not share specific details on the end of this policy.
People who wish to enter China must apply for a visa through embassies or consulates in their countries.
The Chinese government encouraged all businesses and factories to resume operations on March 30, and provided financial assistance to companies.The State Council set April 4 as the date for the national mourning, which began with a three-minute silence at 10 p.m., although the central government asked families to pay their respects online, in keeping with physical distancing due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 was transmitted from China to South Korea on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Administration announced a sharp increase in reported cases of the virus on February 20, largely due to a population census at a religious movement called Shincheon Ji Church of Jesus in Daegu.
Shincheon Ji's students who traveled from Daegu to Wuhan were considered the source of the virus outbreak.
As of February 22, among the church's 9,336 adherents, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on February 29.

Since the emergence of COVID-19, there has been a profound bias, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent and people of ethnicity in Europe, the United States and other countries.
There have been cases of fear, hatred and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia Pacific.
Reports from February (when most cases of the virus were recorded in China) showed that many people around the world feel a strong sense of ethnicity and Chinese people are calling the virus and what happens to them a punishment for their actions.
Anti-China sentiment has also been seen in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support is available both online and offline for the Chinese and regions where the virus is present.
With the spread of the epidemic in some new countries, the people of Italy may also face fears and misgivings, as the country is the first European country to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak.People in Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea have made efforts to contain the epidemic and have petitioned for a ban on Chinese entry into their countries.
In Japan, a hashtag called #Chinese-Japanese-No-Rights was created on Twitter.
Chinese and people from other Asian countries in the UK and the US reported rising levels of racial discrimination and harassment against them.
US President Donald Trump has faced backlash over his speech calling the coronavirus the Chinese virus, a news story that was described by critics as discriminatory and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign fugitives from Wuhan to Novi Sad.
Indian students reported their harassment due to the coronavirus outbreak, who had come from the northeastern regions of India bordering China to major cities for classes.
Bharatiya Janata Party state chief minister in West Bengal Dilip said that the Chinese ruined nature so God has given up on them.
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese Council in Calcutta, which called the statement false.In China, the epidemic has intensified the mistreatment and discrimination against non-Chinese citizens and Chinese people refer to foreigners as foreign occupiers and want to leave China.
Many newspapers have removed them from some or all of their covers.
Many scientific publications have published scientific papers on the epidemic that are accessible to everyone.
Some scientists wanted to share their results via pre-operated servers such as bioRxiv.

There are methods in laboratory testing for the 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease 19-COVID and the existing 2-SARS-CoV virus through which the presence of the virus is diagnosed and the production of the host's antibody against the virus is revealed.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR which detects the coronavirus RNA.
In March 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 virus-derived prototype was identified as a target for post-infection therapy.
It is used to detect the newest and most active contaminants.
Antibody (serology) detection can be used for both diagnosis and public care.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, both those with very few symptoms and those with obvious symptoms.
The exact mortality rate and public safety level of malaria can be determined by the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had accurate data on the spread of the virus in its population as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, with most countries having a policy of not testing in the laboratory for those with lowest symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
This diversity also greatly influences the reported death rate, which may have been highly estimated in some countries.
The test uses real-time reverse transition polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Results are usually available in hours to days.
The RT-PCR test performed on bone samples is valid only in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then escape from the column and enter the lungs.
For those infected who are tested in the second week, alternative samples are taken from their deep respiratory tract using a duct or a sputum.
One of the first PCR tests was conducted at the Berlin Charity in January 2020 using real-time analysis reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and provided the World Health Organization with a distribution of 250,000 thermal thermometers.
The UK also conducted a test on 23 January 2020.On 28 January 2020, a company in South Korea called Cogenebioch developed a clinical-scale device for temperature detection based on PCR and SARS-CoV-2.
It detects the E genome and specific SARS-CoV-2 transmitted by the beta coronavirus.BGI Group was one of the first companies in China to obtain a license from the China National Health Products Administration to use a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 temperature-sensitive diagnostic device.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) accurate time-based diagnostic device (RT-PCR) to its public health laboratories through international introduction resources.
One in three genetic tests of the old test kits resulted in inadequate performance and trial interruption at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to only 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
As of February 28, 2020, the tests performed on two potatoes were not considered satisfactory, and these tests were not accepted to allow state and local laboratories to test.
These tests were confirmed by an emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration. US commercial laboratories began their tests in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that COVID-19 tests are now available nationwide using RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostic also made COVID-19 testing available nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were announced, and sampling and processing must be done according to CDC guidelines.
COVID-19 tests in Russia were developed and implemented by the State Research Center for Virus Identification and Vector Biotechnology.
The test was registered by the Federal Services for Medicare and Medicaid Services on February 11, 2020. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic announced a COVID-19 diagnostic test. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostic Company was granted FDA approval for a test that will be performed on a three-and-a-half-hour high-scale, with approximately 4,128 tests performed in 24 hours using a single machine.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the Abbott m2000 test to Abbott Laboratories; similar licenses were also granted by the FDA to certain laboratories such as: Halogen, LipCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Syphid also received an emergency use authorization from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA accepts tests in which thermal nucleic acid amplification technology is used instead of PCR.
This method can diagnose positive results in as little as 5 minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes because it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles.
About 18,000 of these machines are now available in the United States and Abbott wants to accelerate the production of these machines to carry out 50,000 tests per day.A method of testing using an individual antibody that binds to the coronavirus nucleoscopic protein (N protein) is being explored in Taiwan, with hopes that testing using this method will take as little as 15 to 20 minutes, similar to the rapid influenza test.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that "chest radiography has little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] findings may be present even before symptomatic symptoms".
Double glazing is common in early onset diseases, with environmental, contrast and final breakdown.
Plural dominance and madness (the swelling of the athlete's scalp with variable swelling of the alveolar or ventral cavities), and co-occurrence may occur as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR with PCR in Wuhan suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its reactions being overshadowed by other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for first-line testing or screening to diagnose COVID-19". As of March 2020, WHO recommended the following definitions of cases:
Part of the immune response against microbes is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These cases are used to monitor people, diagnose the immune system, and diagnose those who had symptoms in the first 7 days or so. Tests can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or through a monitoring test (PoCT).
Highly automated systems in most clinical laboratories will carry out these capabilities to perform tests but their availability will depend on the cost of production for each system.
A single screen blood sample is commonly used for CLT, although continuous samples are used for immune system response.
For PoCT, a blood sample is usually taken by perforating the skin.
Unlike the PCR method, there is no pre-test clearance phase required.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named twenty companies that provided the agency with notification as required and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test had been approved through an emergency use permit by the FDA. In late March 2020, Eurovision Medical Diagnostic Laboratory and Epitope Diagnostic Laboratories received European approval for their test Alopecia, which can diagnose IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples per hour and is therefore much faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are usually diagnosable 14 days after the onset of the disease.In early April, the UK found that none of their existing diagnostic tools were useful.
Hong Kong has developed a scheme where suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", they are discharged, sent back and will receive the test result a little later.The British NHS has announced that it is running a scheme to test suspected cases at home, which removes the risk of the patient coming to hospital or the need to disable an ambulance.
Car nose diagnostic centers have helped South Korea to have tests faster and more extensive than in other countries.In Germany, the National Union of Forensic Physicists of Legal Health Insurance said on 2 March that it has a capacity of around 12,000 tests through Planetary Diagnosis and that 10,700 tests had been taken in the past week.
When a dose is ordered by a doctor, the costs are covered by the health insurance.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
By March 19, testing was proposed in several major cities.
The total number of tests performed as of 26 March 2020 was not known as only positive case figures were released.
A preliminary survey of laboratories showed that as of week 2020/12, a total of at least 483,295 tests had been performed and 33,491 sample cases (6.9%) including this week were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.In Israel, researchers at Tekken and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for testing samples from 64 patients at a time, which is done by combining multiple samples, and further testing in case of positive cases in the combined samples.The method was established on February 5, 2020, in Wuhan by BGI on a 2000 square meter site in the heart of the Wuhan International Hospital for Disease Control (BIAD), a large laboratory in China called 火星大工 (火星大工).
By monitoring construction and taking 5 days by BGI founder Wang Jin, modeling shows that cases in Hubei had increased by 47% and the related cost of resolving quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity had not been raised at the same time.
The Wuhan lab is immediately followed by the Huyang labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in all 12 cities of China.
On 4 March 2020 the test capacity was 50,000 tests in one day.Open source, designs shared by Origami Asys were released that could test up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 tests.These parallel designs can be performed in small laboratories without the need for mechanical fluid collectors.
By March, the introduction of insufficient and inadequate doses posed a problem for mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Some authors have been forced to explore sampling preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March it was announced that the UAE is now testing more of its population on a human-to-human basis for coronavirus than any other country, and has reached the point of testing people who have tested more of its population.
This was through a combination of patient-site capacity, and purchasing a population-wide mass testing laboratory from the 42 and BGI group (based on Wei "Ho-Yang" Emergency Detection Laboratories in China).
The lab, which was developed in 14 days, has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first laboratory in the world to operate outside of China to perform such a level of testing.
Genetic profiles of the coronavirus to target different regions and perform different testing procedures were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The WHO sent a German approach to developing kits for low-income countries that lack resources to produce kits themselves.
The German protocol was released on 17 January 2020; a protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not made until 28 January, which suspended testing available in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the start of the pandemic, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demands and recommendations of conducting tests by health experts.
Conversely, experts say that the availability of extensive testing capabilities in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government had built up large-scale testing capacity in private sector laboratories over a period of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for accelerated testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the spread of the virus has led to the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories across the United States, and the supply of soaps and chemicals has been tightened.
In March 2020, China reported a problem with accuracy in their test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "flaws" after which the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private laboratories from conducting tests. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Biovisual Biotechnology Co., but the results were later found to be incorrect.
The company responded that the incorrect results may be due to problems in collecting samples or improper use of the kits.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would return the kits that had negative results, and would instead receive differential test kits from Shenzhen BioWare.The Czech Republic, which purchased any test kits from China, gave 80% of the kits negative results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China after the results were found to be false.
Prime Minister Mateus suggested that it should be changed to the Danube. Atish Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that there were "high levels of errors" in the test kits purchased by Turkey from China and that it had not "used them".The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that the purchased kits were unusable.
Those tests that tested positive were quarantined and those who had contact with people with SARS-CoV-2 positive results were followed up.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two tests of a total population of about 3,400 people, with a gap of about ten days.
Almost half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected patients were quarantined.
With limited access to the community, the new disease is completely eradicated.
Following a sudden contagion, with restrictions on inbound travel, testing, and quarantining, the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in Singapore is progressing much more slowly than in other developing countries, and there are no severe restrictions such as forced closures on restaurants and retail stores.
Many ceremonies were cancelled, and Singapore advised people to stay at home until 28 March, but schools reopened in time after the 23 March holiday.
A number of other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also managed the epidemic with random contact tracking, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, but with low levels of lockdowns or tourism.
A statistical study found that, in terms of deaths, the mortality rates are very low in countries that have performed more tests, possibly because those countries are better able to identify those with only few or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for testing confirmation.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are based in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "positive as% of tests" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people who visit hospitals has a higher percentage of tests positive than a country that tests the entire population, whether people have symptoms or not, but other things being equal.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap continuously at "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and urinary tract infections, which are transmitted from the hands to the mouth by vector materials.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, and mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
The five critical times of the day when hand washing with soap is important are: before and after urinating, after cleaning the baby's lower extremities or changing the bumper, before feeding the baby, before and after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hand washing can also be done with aerosol. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing in the following situations:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after patient care.
After changing diapers or cleaning children who have had a bath.
After sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene habits related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medication or medical care can prevent or slow the spread of disease.
The main health purpose of hand washing is to cleanse hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is an important practice for all people.
Hand washing has many health benefits, such as reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory diseases;
And lowering infant mortality at home birth.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing habits may lead to minor improvements in height growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple habits changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can result in a reduction of about 50% in the mortality rate from these diseases.
Measures that promote hand washing can reduce nearly three-quarters of diarrhea cases, and this is linked to the provision of clean water in low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea incidents may be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the only effective and cost-effective method for preventing diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), if done automatically in homes, schools, and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, a major contributor to ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, claiming the lives of about 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of about 3.5 million children a year.
According to UNICEF, making hand-washing a regular habit before meals and after using the toilet could save more lives than any vaccination or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from urinary incontinence by half and deaths from respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is often associated with other forms of sanitation as part of the Water, Sanitation and Sanitation (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects against dead germs that are transmitted through direct physical contact.
The only minor side effect of hand washing is that repeated hand washing can cause skin damage due to dryness.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, scaly skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Frequent hand washing is also known as a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when washing hands with soap is important in reducing the transmission of diseases from food to the mouth: after using the toilet (to remove sputum or urine), after cleaning the baby's lower parts (changing the bumper), before feeding the baby, before and after preparing food or after touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other situations where proper hand washing techniques should be used to prevent transmission of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound; after coughing, sneezing and blowing the nose; after handling animal waste or animal waste; and after touching waste.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is very low.
A 2015 handwashing study in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that the highest rate was 97 percent in Saudi Arabia; the average in the United States is nearly 77 percent; and the lowest is 23 percent in China. Several methods of habit modification are currently available to increase the habit of handwashing with soap at critical times. Mass handwashing for school children at set times of the day is an option in developing countries to make handwashing a habit among children.
The "Health Care Essentials Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of scale action for children's health and educational development.
Twice a year, treatment of gingivitis, as well as daily hand washing with soap, daily tooth brushing with fluoride are the main goals of this national program.
The program is also being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is promoted by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce the barrier in the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is not effective in cleansing the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in water.
Proper water flow only helps with cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its recyclability, may retain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that have looked at bacterial transmission from contaminated solid soaps have concluded that such transmission is much less likely because bacteria are purified with soap foam.
The CDC still says "It is better to use liquid soap for clean control than hand contact for use by multiple people".
Antibacterial soap has been widely promoted among health-conscious people.
To date, there is no evidence that the proposed antibiotic- or non-antibiotic-based drugs used are optimal for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antimicrobial soaps contain common antimicrobials such as triclosan, which has a wide list of resistance types to the organism.
So if antibiotic-resistant varieties are not chosen for antimicrobial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protectors, as pH regulators, complex formulations such as antimicrobially active benzoic acid and other skin conditions (elovera, vitamins, menthol, plant extract) may contain acidic acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid).A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicates that the use of simple soap is as effective in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands as antibacterial soaps that contain triiodothyronine.
Hot water that is suitable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
But in removing natural meats that contain soil and bacteria, hot soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of hot water has no effect in reducing microbial stress on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand sanitizer without water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, waterless hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand sanitizer, or hand sanitizer) gained popularity.
Many consist of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol mixed in a gel with solids such as carbomer (a polymer of acrylic acid), or a haemocant such as glycerin in liquid, or foam to facilitate use and reduce the drying effects of alcohol.
Liquid deodorization of hydrogen peroxide thicknesses further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers with at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective in killing germs.
Alcoholic sanitizers kill bacteria, multiple drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), mania, and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, mumps, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcoholic sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (a reduction of 3.5 logs, equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) 30 seconds after touching hands and kill 99.99% of bacteria (a reduction of 4 to 5 logs) to 99.999% 1 minute after touching hands.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are completely ineffective against Norovirus (or Norvac) type viruses, which are the main cause of gastroenteritis.
The sanitizer should be applied to the front and back of the hands and between and to the ends of all fingers for about 30 seconds to dry the liquid, foam or gel.
The tips of the fingers should also be thoroughly washed, and both fingers should be wiped.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand sanitizer, especially when hands are very dirty.
The increased use of these materials depends on their ease of use and quick killing activity against microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Repeated use of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers can cause dry skin without a skin softener or moisturizer formula.
The skin-drying effects of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softeners to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-containing hand sanitizers containing softeners cause less skin itching and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Contact sensitivity to dermatitis, urticaria syndrome contact or severe sensitivity to alcohol or hand washing with alcohol are rare.
The lower propensity for itchy irritation with dermatitis has become more noticeable than hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless materials do not clean organic matter from hands, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens still remain on hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and composition, and has historically been less used than alcohol and alcohol-free hand sanitizers.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have shown that, unlike alcohol, they have a more persistent and anti-microbial effect after use, and their effectiveness has been reduced after repeated use, possibly due to persistent adverse reactions on the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use hay or soil instead.
Air or soil may be more effective without water but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or air becomes contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase rather than reduce the spread of disease.
Like soap, algae are also an anti-infective agent because, when mixed with water, they form an alkaline solution.
The World Health Organization has recommended ironing or washing as a substitute for soap when soap is not available.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission of the disease has the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because standing water in a bowl may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not make a difference.
Wash hands with a sufficient amount of soap and wash the back of the hands, including the fingertips and the fingernails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that people prefer to wash their hands better when they are using soap instead of just water.
Let it sit for at least 20 seconds.
Moisture creates a clot, which helps remove microbes from the skin, and long-term moisture removes most microbes.
Wash it well under running water.
It can be re-contaminated by hand washing in a bowl.
Dry your hands with a clean towel or hold them to an air dryer.
Wet and wet hands can easily become contaminated again. The most common remaining areas of the hand are the thick, dull, inter-finger areas and the under-finger areas.
Artificial nails and polished nails may give rise to microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage which can increase the risk of disease transmission.
In developing countries, where tap water and/or soap are not available, many low-cost options can be developed to facilitate hand washing, e.g., draining water from a suspended bush or pond that has adequate soap and/or using aerosols when needed. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are then water conservation solutions, such as "tape pipes or dropped bushes", and other low-cost options.
Tippy-tap or taped tap is a simple technique where a stick is tapped with a handle, and a piece of wood moved by the foot drips a small amount of water on the hands and is available with soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of hand hygiene procedures, but there is some debate over the most effective type of drying in public toilets.
Large-scale research suggests that paper towels found in many toilets are healthier than electric hand dryers.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, funded by the papermaking industry called the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels recommended by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and other advanced jet air dryers for hands.
After hand washing and hand drying with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194% on the fingertips and 254% on the back.
Hand drying with a jet air dryer led to an increase in the total number of bacteria on the fingertips by an average of 42% and in the wrist by 15%.
After washing hands and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the fingertips and 77% on the back.The scientists also performed the tests to determine whether any drying method resulted in contamination among other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The jet air purifier, which claims to pump air at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of ejecting microorganisms from hands and units and possibly contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
A hot air hand dryer releases microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the machine.
No specific spread of microorganisms was observed in the paper desmal. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after hand-drying:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels in the hand dryers industry.
Using hand sanitizer to wash hands is an alternative when traveling in the absence of soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after a Hungarian doctor named Ignaz Semmelweis found hand washing effective in preventing disease in a hospital environment (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget to wear them.
One study found that using them reduced infection rates.
The medical handwashing procedure is for at least 15 seconds, and sufficient soap and water or gel should be used to soften and all parts of the hands should be washed.
The hands should be covered by inserting the fingers of both hands into each other.
If there is a hole under the fingernails, brushes should be used to remove it.
Since microbes may remain on hands in water, it is important to wash hands well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, a paper towel should be used to seal the water (and, if necessary, open the exit door with paper).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands from the areas.
Hand washing in a health care facility is intended to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Medical Journal reports that the rate of hand-washing in many medical settings is at an unacceptable level, with many doctors and nurses consistently forgetting to wash their hands before contact with patients, and thus transmitting germs.
One study showed that hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce catheter-related blood flow disorders by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a paper outlining standard hand washing and hand sanitizing practices in healthcare sectors.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines by the organization are also available on its website for public comment.
A related review was conducted by Whitby and his colleagues.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if necessary to prove compliance with regulations.
According to the World Health Organization, hand washing should be done in the following "five conditions":
After contact with blood/body fluids
Before performing disinfection, and
After treatment of the patient. Adding antifungal chemicals to soap ("medical" or "anti-microbial" soap) gives the handwashing agent its killing power.
This type of microbicide killing may be required before surgery or in medical facilities where the spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms is highly likely. To clean one's hands for the purpose of surgery it is necessary to have a tap available that can be turned on and off without touching the hands, some chlorhexidine or washing iodine should also be available, as well as a sanitary towel to dry the hands after washing, a sanitary brush for washing hair and a sanitary tool for cleaning the underparts of the fingertips.
All jewelry must be removed.
The method requires washing hands from side to side for 2-6 minutes.
Long-term (10-minute) hand washing is not mandatory.
When watering, water should be avoided from the sides towards the hands.
After hand washing is completed, the hands should be dried with a sanitary towel, and surgical clothing should be removed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after treating an infected person.
For the control of staph infection in hospitals, the greatest benefit of handwashing was found to come from the initial 20% handwashing and the least additional benefit was achieved when handwashing repetition exceeded 35%.
Washing hands with plain soap leads to three times more bacterial infection transmission to food than washing with antimicrobial soap.Blowing an alcohol-containing solution on hands for an average of 30 seconds and comparing washing hands with antimicrobial soap showed that alcohol-containing hand washes reduced microbial contamination by 26% more than antimicrobial soaps.
But soap and water are more effective than handwashing alcohols at reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and cluster headache spores from hands.Health care facilities can improve hand hygiene by educating staff about handwashing, increasing the availability of handwashing alcohols, and providing written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine which of these approaches are most effective in various healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap has been recognized as a low-cost and essential means to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has led to the challenge of handwashing becoming a universal practice.
For example, hand washing faucets near private or public toilets are very rare in many rural areas of Africa, while there are cheaper options for building hand washing facilities.
However, a lower level of hand washing can be the result of a poorly formed habit than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and supporting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to a change in people's long-standing habits.
Monitoring and evaluation are necessary for this work to be effective.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing hand-washing habits in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.An example of hand-washing promotion in schools is the "three-star approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and affordable steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap among other healthy requests.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one star to three stars eventually.
The creation of handwashing facilities can be part of handwashing promotion campaigns that are being done to reduce the rates of disease and child mortality.
The World Handwashing Day awareness-raising campaign is another example of how habit change tries to achieve its goals.In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, UNICEF promoted the adoption of handwashing emojis.
A few studies have considered the overall impact of handwashing costs on the prevention of DALYs in developing countries.
However, one review suggested that promoting handwashing with soap is much cheaper than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have recently given birth in hospitals or wounded soldiers - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two leading doctors of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Agnes Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale who was an Englishwoman and "founder of modern nursing".
At the time, many people believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called mesmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne illnesses and health care-associated infections forced the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, posters titled "Proper Hand Washing Techniques" have been posted in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hands of a thing" means that one is expressing dissatisfaction by taking responsibility for one's thing or by sharing in the crime.
The text originates from the biblical message in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to execute Jesus Christ but became a widely used phrase in English societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth is forced to wash her hands in an effort to clear the imaginary stain she has seen on her being, representing her guilty conscience about the crimes she has committed and encouraging her husband to do the same.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or contemplating immoral acts, are more likely than at other times to wash their hands, and place more value on handwashing equipment.
Furthermore, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such a thought are less likely to engage in other compulsory "cleaning" tasks, such as volunteering.
Religions also recommend hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, i.e. the use of water to wash hands without soap, is part of the ritual of hand washing in many religions such as the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Telugu and the Neeta-Latiyum in Judaism, the Lhasa in Christianity, and the Uday in Islam. Religions also recommend hand washing, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate hand washing after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam mandate hand washing before and after every meal.
COVID-19 risk control measures at work
COVID-19 risk control measures at work include the use of occupational safety and health practices to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Significant risk control measures in the workplace, risk assessment of sources of infection, severity of infection in the community, and risk factors for each worker who may be at risk of contracting COVID-19 depend on the workplace and occupation.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States recommends that there is less work-related contact with people and other workers in low-risk occupations, which is why it is recommended that early prevention measures be taken to prevent infection. Primary prevention measures include avoiding illness, telling workers to stay home if they become ill, taking preventive measures to prevent respiratory transmission, and cleaning and disinfecting the work environment on a daily basis.
Medium-risk occupations are those that require sustained and close contact with strangers and people suspected of COVID-19 but may become ill due to ongoing social transmission and international travel.
This work environment includes workers who are in contact with people, such as schools, crowded work environments, and crowded retail locations.
In addition to the primary prevention measures, risk control measures for this group include effective air filtering air conditioners, plastic or glass screen protectors, personal protective equipment or devices because you may be exposed to someone who is infected with COVID-19.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States assumes that healthcare and funeral workers, who deal with people who are infected or suspected of having COVID-19, are at high risk of contracting the disease.
Risk control measures that are appropriate for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure air-conditioning chambers, and work-appropriate personal safety equipment.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a number of effects on the workplace.
Workers may be unable to attend work because of illness, the need to protect others, and the fear of contracting illness.
The way of doing business may change. These ways may also change depending on the demand for goods and the means by which these goods are obtained (e.g., double-dealing at low cost, or delivery to the customer or delivery of fast services by car/motorcycle).
Finally, transport routes from geographic areas that have been severely affected by COVID-19 may be cut off. The Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan can be used to guide safety measures.
The plans target different workplace and occupational risk levels, including sources of exposure, risk factors from home, and social settings and risk factors for older workers and workers with chronic health conditions.
Also, the plans outline control measures to address the risks and provide potential plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may require national and regional recommendations.
The goal of responding to an outbreak of a communicable disease is to reduce the rate of transmission among workers, to save people at risk of a more complex health condition, to maintain work activities, and to reduce side effects on other entities in the supply chain of activities.
The severity of disease in the community in which business is conducted affects the responses that are performed.
The hierarchy of risk control measures is a framework, widely used to classify risk control measures in terms of their effectiveness on occupational safety and health.
In places where it is not possible to eliminate COVID-19 risks, the most effective control measures are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls, without reliance on the ability of the worker, are to protect workers from work-related hazards, and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement this work.
Administrative controls are changes to work policies or procedures that require action on the part of the employee and manager.
Personal protective equipment is considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can sometimes help prevent disease.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected based on the risk to the worker, properly installed (e.g., respirators), continuously and properly removed, regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and maintained or disposed of to prevent contamination.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says that low-risk occupations have low workplace interactions with people and coworkers.
Basic prevention measures for the spread of disease, recommended for all workplaces, include frequent and complete handwashing, staying at home if workers are sick, preventing respiratory transmission including covering up coughs and sores, preparing dishes for paper and used goods, preparing for telephone contact or changing shifts if necessary, avoiding workers from using other tools and equipment, and maintaining a clean and disinfected work environment on a daily basis.
The most important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace is to quickly identify and isolate potential infections.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home until their fever is relieved by using fever-reducing or symptom-killing medications for at least 24 hours, the fever symptoms are removed, and other symptoms are gone.
From the perspective of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with a moderate risk of infection include workers who are in close contact or in quarantine within 6 feet (1.8 m) of people who are not infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission around workplaces or due to a recent international travel to a place where COVID-19 has spread.
These include workers who are in common contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density work environments, or retail stores or places where there is a high number of customers. Engineering controls for these and other high-risk groups include the installation of effective air filters, the installation of ventilation equipment, the installation of transparent plastic screens to remove physical barriers, the provision of rapid services from customer service vehicles/motors. The use of public and high-risk facilities includes the use of personal protective equipment to train employees to respond to the needs of the public, including providing food and other emergency equipment to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at workplaces, providing medical care and other emergency services, providing a safe environment for those who need to stay indoors, and providing a safe environment for those who are at risk of contracting COVID-19 at workplaces, including providing emergency medical care and other emergency contacts, providing a safe environment for those who are unable to reach or reach workplaces, and providing access to medical and hygienic equipment.
Workers in this high-risk group require very little respiratory ventilation.
If someone is sick on an aircraft, appropriate controls for the safety of crew and other passengers include isolating other passengers and crew by maintaining a distance of 6 feet from each other, recommending the sick person to wear a mask, and asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and urine with a paper towel when coughing and sneezing.
The relevant cabin passenger should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and if possible use personal protective equipment or other equipment in the event that the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Disposable goods and disposable items should be packaged in red/hazard bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.Controls of the risk of transportation on commercial ships, including heavy ferries and other passenger ships, include delaying travel when someone is sick, and if someone on board has fever or other symptoms of illness, they should be isolated and informed immediately to the medical staff on board.
In principle, this is a medical check-up in the isolationist's cabin. For schools and child care centers, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a temporary school break for cleaning and disinfection in cases where an infected person has come to school regardless of the social transmission of the disease.
Where there is little chance of reducing social transmission, social distancing strategies should be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, meetings and other large gatherings, such as physical education or church meetings or cafeteria gatherings, increasing the distance between tables, changing arrival and departure times, limiting/reducing visitor screening, and using separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When transmission continues strongly in the local community, extended school holidays may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers law enforcement personnel, who perform daily activities and tasks, to be at low risk of an emergency health situation.
Law enforcement authorities, who may have come into contact with individuals infected or suspected of COVID-19, are advised to follow appropriate guidelines, including appropriate personal protective equipment, such as emergency medical personnel.
Where close contact is made during detention, personnel should clean and disinfect their belts and military clothing on homemade disinfectant sprays prior to second use, and observe standard operating procedures/procedures for the maintenance and disposal of used personal protective equipment and the maintenance and washing of clothing.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) notes that health and funeral workers are facing high and extremely high rates of infection.
Highly infected occupations include health care and relief workers, laboratory, and medical transportation workers who are exposed to COVID-19 infection and suspected infection.
If workers apply procedures to prevent the production of airborne particles on people who are suspected of being infected with COVID-19 and collect or use samples from them for testing, they are at high risk of contracting the disease.
Procedures to prevent the production of airborne particles include a tube in the body, a cough drop, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, and large-scale sampling.
Highly infectious funeral staff jobs include those engaged in preparing the bodies of people who are diagnosed as dying or suspected of COVID-19. Where these staff perform autopsies, their exposure to the disease is significantly increased. Additional engineering controls for this high-risk group include isolation of cells for COVID-19 infected and suspected patients, as well as preventive procedures for the production of particles in the air.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some medical and funeral homes.
Samples should be taken with Biosafety Level 3 precautions in mind.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that prospective patients be placed in isolation waiting rooms in the event of a suspected COVID-19 case.In addition to other personal protective equipment, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends respirators for workers working within 6 feet of SARS-CoV-2 infected or suspected patients and workers who are performing procedures to prevent the production of airborne particles.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respiratory face masks or better must be used in a comprehensive and documented respiratory safety program. This program includes appropriate training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators are used to provide better safety and comfort for the worker. The World Health Organization does not recommend covering, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease. The disease is not transmitted through bodily fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends only medical masks for screening personnel at the door.
The World Health Organization recommends surgical masks, eyeglasses, face masks, medical clothing and gloves/towels for those who take respiratory samples from, care for, or transport COVID-19 patients repeatedly without performing procedures to prevent the production of particulate matter in the air.
If a procedure to prevent the production of particulate matter in the air is performed, it may be called an N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask instead of a surgical mask.
As the global provision of personal protective equipment is inadequate, the World Health Organization recommends establishing remote healthcare and physical barriers such as clean windows, reducing the need for personal protective equipment, allowing the use of personal protective equipment only to those who are directly caring for COVID-19 patients, only for specific essential tasks, such as using personal protective equipment without removing a respiratory mask while caring for the same patients, monitoring and coordinating the supply/delivery chain of personal protective equipment, and not prescribing masks for those with symptoms.

Subject: [COVID-19] Carrying the burden and preparing for the future
Date/time of release: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC

This month we find ourselves in remarkable situations.
The COVID-19 pandemic is something that highlights our global human bonds and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
We have no history of these challenges, but we know that our best response depends on a kind of global compassion, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The collaboration and attention we have had among our colleagues through emails, phone calls, and online chats is the tremendous trust and confidence of the amazing people we are fortunate to work with.
I cannot thank you enough and am proud to count you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
It reminded me of how meaningful news it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia, and how powerful a symbol it is as an important resource that is online and accessible to everyone.
It's your job to decide whether you want to keep the site open or take the money from your co-workers or keep the community safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides more than ever.
This is the moment when not what we do or how we do it can have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will be making some significant adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
Adjust your work and schedule
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team had a meeting last night to discuss our strategy and schedule for the coming days and months.
In these conversations, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we were facing and what would be the best way to keep the organization or agency stable and strong during this time.
We wanted very badly to remove the pressure and support our mission in the long run.
If you want to dial it again, no problem.
For all employees, contractors, and contractors:
Our daily work expectation is 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We don't have any holidays. If you can work longer than normal hours, the mission can use you.
Yet, the world is very unpredictable today, and your well-being is our priority, whether you're taking care of your pets, buying groceries or seeing a doctor.
We don't monitor your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should be done without saying, but we're telling you.
No sick leave or PTO required  Just tell your manager and help your team review the equipment and schedules to make sure key parts of the job are covered.
(If you test positive for COVID-19, please let Brian T&C Ops know so T&C can help you and make sure your situation is properly addressed by management.)
Hourly workers are paid in full.
We have said before and we repeat that we respect our commitment to our contractors and hourly workers.
Each will be paid based on their normal hours under normal circumstances.
If you are sick and unable to work, this is also included.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their work as a way to circulate their stress around the world.
What we do is incredibly rewarding, especially at a time like this.
Still, it means taking care of yourself.
What we ask is that you talk to your manager, that is, that you know what to expect and that you can calibrate yourself accordingly.
Some tasks are considered important.
There are some things we have to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &, Security and Capital Requirement teams (among others) are doing important work that may need additional assistance.
We will begin a process with all agencies to evaluate current objectives and focus on supporting what is important to our mission.
There are many agencies doing it for us, we all need to focus on the most important projects.
For now, walking is painless.
We do not plan to "give double time to prepare" once the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to do this extra work to meet the deadline, because it is now fantasy and unrealistic.
We accept that the situation has changed, and we must work to set new goals and timelines.
What about annual planning?
To adapt to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the timetable for presenting our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan, which creates more time to budget and gives employees the opportunity to prioritize critical work, self-care, compassionate care, while placing those who wish to work on a reduced schedule in the coming weeks.
Extension of deadlines greatly reduces the current planning workload and stress across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update the delegation and teams on the new measures once we have the approval.
Thanks to the leadership of the APP team in this regard.
Office status, disease resistance, and hygiene
Last week, we received news that our SF affiliates may have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, taking a series of precautions, we hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect every surface as well as the lobby and elevator rails that reach our floor.
Maintenance duties in the building use protocol and use materials that help with tenants' safety.
We feel reassured that the office will be ready when we return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocols with us and DC related staff.
As of last week, our DC office has been moved to a completely remote location in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As our affiliates in New York City know, we're talking about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These talks are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working in remote areas for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know that this can be a form of order and adjustment, and would like to offer you some greetings:
Limit the length of sessions to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how this session can be divided into several sessions over the course of several days.
State clearly the purpose of the meeting, should include an agenda, and send reading material before the meeting.
Chat video on Google Docs and Zoom tools to create live help and collaboration and contact.
Appoint a leader to organize each session. Someone to oversee the discussion of questions and to keep track of the speaker list and someone to help take notes (or take notes jointly).
If you need a quiet microphone or headphones, send an email to tech support.
Use your welfare payment for breakfast.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The Human Resource Activities team reviews webinar-based ergonomics guidelines to support consistency of distributed work across the organization.
Last week we asked community-related contractors to cancel Wikimedia-funded public programs, such as EditTunes, until the end of the pandemic is declared by the World Health Organization.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions would make it impossible for them to carry out their contractual activities and that no one would be penalized for delaying or changing the objectives of such activities.
We will start monitoring further guidelines for Wikimedia and other regional and community thematic conferences next week.
The general sense of the international community seems to be depressed by the chaos, but is calm and comfortable in its clarity and ability to focus on its communities, Wikimedia, and others.
Moving forward, CRT is working on creating a page on Metawiki to create a space for the community to monitor impacts and track our interactions with them.
Dealing with COVID-19 related issues
We will place an invitation to your mechanic about a special working meeting on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional new information, answer your questions, and connect with each other.
We're in this together and if we can help each other that way.
In addition, you can continue to find information at this email address and find more important information about COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep the information on these pages up to date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working on maintaining ongoing contacts with staff currently residing in most affected countries.
If you have questions about a tour, programs, major workflow, coverage challenges, or anything else that you need help with, you can no doubt contact or work with CRT.
We want to provide assistance and build relationships when needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive information, please email it to Brian Judden, Head of Global Operations, Human Resources.
No change should be considered a waiver of duties and responsibilities.
Rather, it is a recognition that at a time our work and responsibilities should be regulated in a way that was not previously regulated.
These are steps we believe are necessary to support each other, so we can continue our work, provide our operations with the assistance they need and provide the world with a service they can trust.
Our planned work will be waiting for us in time.
For now it is time to support each other and create space for the important work that may be facing us in the coming weeks and possibly months.
We need you to achieve this goal, and we ask you to take care of yourself and your family, so that you will be ready and able to respond when the need arises.
Now please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine, the CRT (in Amanda, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jim V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jim V, Janine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 reduces the amount of angiotensin II and inhibits the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) with Ang ((1-7)) increases, thus making it a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a type of zinc, a metalloenzyme that is localized to the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the M2 domain of the N-terminal peptides and the C-terminal clearin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, containing an enzymatically active domain, and expressed on the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer domain of ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shidas, and the final soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted through the urine or feces.
ACE2 is present in many organs: ACE2 is bound in most organs to the main lung type II alveolar cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and vascular endothelial cells, and arterial muscle cells.
The ACE2 mRNA form is also found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance for ACE.
ACE isolates the visonstrictor angiotensin II into the angiotensin II hormone.
ACE2, in turn, isolates the carboxylic terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and converts it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also isolate a number of other peptides such as [des-Arg9] - bridicin, epinephrine, neurotensin, denorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane that is the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartenstein's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, such as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); andSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 proteins to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and transmission for both viruses and enzymes that are localized in cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a potential treatment, leading some to speculate that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight disease.
However, several professional societies and regulatory agencies have recommended continuing with standard ACE inhibitors and ARB treatment.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those who had had stroke and heart disease.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related deaths, although the results were less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia".
Human ACE2 synthesis (rhACE2) is considered a novel treatment for acute pulmonary injury and appears to improve pulse hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes, with an effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those who are intolerant of classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where angiotensin II is elevated.Injection of rhACE2 for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials.
b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to assist in contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, e.g., the process of identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions and powers, various applications were developed or proposed with the official support of governments.
Several frameworks have been developed for building a contact tracking app.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly regarding systems built on the geolocation tracking of app users.
A small number of resistant alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to allow the user to log in to other mobile phones as they approach.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would jointly support Bluetooth-based apps to work directly on their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
The app is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
The app was developed by the regional IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called "StopKorona!" that tracks potential patients and provides quick responses to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the App Store.
On 12 April, the government said that the contact tracking app was in the final stages of development, and would be available in a few weeks. Similar apps are also planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia is considering introducing a geofencing app for patients in Moscow who are infected with COVID-19, and the format is designed to ensure they do not go out of their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of potential practical problems in app-based systems, including the negative consequences of those errors and the potential lack of effectiveness if the use of the app is limited to only a small fraction of people.
In response to concerns about the release of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set restrictions on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store. It has limited them to "official" or, in other words, reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed concern about the effects of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly whether the surveillance infrastructure built to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled once the threat was over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The above organizations announced eight conditions for the government projects:
supervision must be "legal, compulsory and proportionate";
Extension of supervision and surveillance should have a termination clause;
The use of data will be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Information security and uncertainty should be safeguarded and protected based on evidence;
Digital surveillance should prevent discrimination and marginalization;
Sharing of information with third parties should be defined in law;
Protections against abuse and on the rights of citizens should be in place to respond to abuse;
Meaningful participation by all "going-to-action" is seen as necessary, including public health experts and marginalized groups.The German Disorder Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also published checklists.
Google/Apple's proposed plan is intended to solve the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems when it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download apps and has the ability to prevent tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was adopted.
Network-based solutions that access raw location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all centralized systems are required to have central servers that have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-saving systems have been built that use central servers only for internal communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an app-free system was used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking data from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined them to notify potential infected individuals via text messages.
In addition to using this information to notify potential contacts, the government has also released public access to location data, which has been allowed due to sweeping changes in data privacy laws since the MERS outbreak in the country.
People access this information through a number of apps and websites. Other countries, including Germany, use centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details about this have not yet been released.
Privacy-preserving contact tracing is an established good idea, with considerable literature research dating back to at least 2013.By 7 April 2020, dozens of groups of experts were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect the user to other mobile phones in close proximity.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that has both centralized and decentralized methods and does not have a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include proximity privacy protection decentralized tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact incident numbers, CEN), privacy sensitivity protocols and mobile communication tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all comparisons are done on the device.
The Privacy Group is developing SafePaths at the MIT Media Lab, a platform for using privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is a platform-based research published in the March 2020 white paper "Apps Gone Wrong: Maintaining Privacy in a Pandemic". A similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a privacy technologies company originally developed at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses hardware-secure technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities, without compromising on the privacy of that information.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Alliance was formed by a number of groups that combined around similar procedures and largely extensive protocols aimed at regulating analytics, and facilitating global collaboration in tracking and alerting apps which is a key aspect of achieving the goal of widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had released the BlueTrace protocol as an open source to be used by their official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claim will protect privacy and be based on a combination of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-preserving cryptography.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be implemented in three phases:
Launching tools to enable governments to create official privacy-protecting coronavirus tracking apps
Integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple plan to resolve the initiation and ongoing monitoring issues first by distributing the system through an operating system update and later in the same manner by removing data when the threat ended.
In place of treating the disease for which it was originally developed, drug repositioning (also known as using a drug for another purpose, re-profiling, re-assigning or changing a treatment) refers to the reuse of an approved drug to treat another disease or medical condition.
This is a line of scientific research currently being pursued to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other directions of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the delivery of plasma into the gut.SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 drug-binding proteins, each containing multiple ligand binding points.
Analysis of these binding points provides a suitable project for the development of effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include papine-type proteases, RNA-related RNA polymerases, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribosphate.
Hussein A and colleagues studied a number of selectable compounds, which they then optimized and analyzed to find skeletal similarity to the most accepted drugs, in order to accelerate the development of potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in preclinical studies and to propose them to clinical research design.
Chloroquine is a type of antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied as part of a cohesive clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The drug has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is approved by the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use only in patients who are hospitalized but not eligible for treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC stated that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been determined.
Doctors said they would use the drug until they "had no choice".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorokine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Large-scale research is underway at Duke and Oxford Universities.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting trials on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine inhibitors.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed and shown favipiravir to be a "clearly effective" drug.
Negative results were seen in an average of 4 days in 35 patients in Shenzhen who received the drug, compared to 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study of 240 pneumonia patients in Wuhan, half of the patients were given faviparpir and half were given omefenvir.

The use of the drug may not be safe for pregnant women or those planning a pregnancy.
A study of lupinavir/retonavir (Caletra), a combination of antiviral lupinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit".
The drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to the prosthesis.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a compound that can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There are concerns within the scientific community that resources are being directed to provide approved drugs for other diseases to treat the disease, especially those developed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization also included lupinevir/ritonavir in the Global Alliance trial.
Remdesivir was developed and manufactured by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later found that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against several phylloxera, pneumo-, paramexo-, and coronaviruses.
One issue with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some pre-trial research suggests that remdesivir may be a major genetic barrier to resistance.Several clinical trials are underway, two of which have been conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one in people with moderate disease and another in people with more severe disease.
Three clinical trials of lung vitamin C are underway in people who are hospitalized and have severe COVID-19 disease; two are placebo-controlled (China, Canada), and one is non-controlled (Italy).

Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially reusable drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are:
Tucsilizumab (IL-6 anti-receptor drug): Approved by China.
Also tested in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019.
Although clinical trials on any vaccine have not been completed, efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In February 2020, the World Health Organization said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the related or causative virus, to be developed in less than 18 months.
There were five vaccine candidates in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The worldwide outbreak peaked in 2020, prompting significant investment and research work to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the released genome to develop a possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
As revealed in April, the key issues for the CEPI initiative to develop a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, providing a certain amount of data, and global access.
In April, scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19 as early as 2020.
The main objectives of the platform that have been developed in Phase I safety studies are as follows:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Cancino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 39 more announced but with limited public data available (considered to be under planning or in the planning stages).
Phase I-II trials, which are the first safety and immunogenicity trials, are generally randomized, placebo-controlled, and multi-site/space trials, while also being the most accurate and effective dosage/drug determinants.
Phase III trials typically involve a large number of participants. A control group of these participants includes the efficacy of the vaccine trial for disease prevention, while monitoring for side effects is at a promising dose/drug.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development that have been confirmed since early April 2020, 74 have not been tested in human evaluation (still in pre-clinical trials).
Around 24 April 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating a possible molecule-catcher vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to induce an immune response.
Around 24 January 2020, the Global Vaccine Centre or Video-Interaction at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada announced the start of work on a vaccine, with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced on 26 January 2020 at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and on 28 January at the University of Hong Kong.

Around 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were partnering with Novavax Corporation
have been involved in vaccine development and production.
Both partners announced plans for preclinical trials and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working separately on 11 microbial strains, and that it would take about one to two years to develop a vaccine, if it were to be done soon.
On 12 March 2020, a biotechnology company in Quebec City reported the creation and development of coronavirus particles that were partly funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The selected vaccine is a laboratory study, alongside a human trial planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian newspaper reported that US President Donald Trump had paid heavily to Kevorkian for widespread access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government objected to.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German biotech company to develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The selective RNA-based vaccine BNT162, which is currently undergoing preclinical trials, will begin clinical trials in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Taxis Biotech, an Italian company, announced that they would receive the results of preclinical trials in April 2020 and begin human trials of the final selectable vaccine in autumn/fall.
On 19 March 2020, the Five-Party Coalition on Epidemic Preparedness in France announced $4.9 million in funding for a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium.The consortium includes the Institut Pasteur, Thames Biosciences (Vienna, Austria), and the University of St. Petersburg, bringing the total investment of CEPI to $29 million for the development of the vaccine.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Quirvack, Inovive, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different selective vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The selective vaccine was developed with a 14-day supply of the series from China.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced a C$275 million grant to 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including a number of selective vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, including Medicare and the University of Saskatchewan Innovations.
Meanwhile, the Government of Canada announced a $192 million grant specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, including plans to create a "vaccine bank" of various new vaccines that will be used in the event of the spread/development of a variant of the coronavirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of St. Petersburg Medical School reported on the testing of Petkovak, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice. The report stated, "MNA administered SARS-CoV-2S1 second-line vaccines that induced specific antibody-strength responses to the antigen [in mice] that appeared within 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced a proposal for a DNA-selective vaccine as a possible nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be engineered to replace bacteria inside the human body to produce virus-like harmless particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, including Cloud Computing Resources, joined forces and shared their resources to acquire supercomputers from IBM.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called side effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond disease prevention.
Lanuru in Australia is looking to hire 4170 healthcare workers for randomized trials.
A vaccine may not be safe and effective while in development.
Initial studies to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines for COVID-19 using animal models, such as ACA2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human vertebrates require international coordination to ensure Level 3 biosecurity measures and standard safety procedures for controlling live viruses.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in nonhuman or animal models.
As of 2020, no vaccine for the treatment or safety of SARS has been developed to prove that it is both safe and effective for humans.
According to studies published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for all governments and public health agencies around the world.
When the MERS was published, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a blueprint for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was only one DNA-based MERS vaccine that has completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three others are under development.All vaccines are viral-transmitter vaccines, the other two are adenoviral-victoride or ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac, and one is the MAV-MERS-S vaccine.
He developed conspiracy theories in social media posts claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not known in advance and that a vaccine was not available in advance.
The patent cited by numerous social media posts provided the source of available patents for other coronavirus strains, such as SARS-CoV, genetic sequences, and vaccines.
B Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID-19 is an infectious disease that causes the symptomatic acute respiratory illness coronavirus 2.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and constipation.
Other symptoms include fatigue, joint pain, nausea, back pain, loss of sense of smell, and nasal pain.
The incubation period and onset of symptoms is about five days, but may take two to fourteen days.
While most cases are symptomatic, some include viral pneumonia and multi-organ dysfunction.
As of 17 April 2020, 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 countries and territories worldwide, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is spread primarily through close contact between people, often through small droplets during coughing, sneezing and talking.
While these droplets are produced during respiration, they usually float on the ground or other surfaces, but are not a virus transmitted over long distances.
People can also contract the virus by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, and mouth.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours on various surfaces.
It is most transmissible and contagious within three days after onset of symptoms, although the virus can also spread before symptoms appear or in the later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is by means of the transcription polymerase chain reaction of the source via the nasopharyngeal swab/dandruff.
The use of masks is also recommended for those suspected of having the virus.
Recommendations for mask use vary among the general public, with some authorities recommending no use, some recommending use, and some recommending use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for the treatment of COVID-19 virus.
Transmission was recorded locally in all six WHO regions, in most countries.
People infected with the virus may not have symptoms or may not have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and saltiness.
Symptoms of an emergency include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain and pressure, gangstia, difficulty waking from bed, red face and back; emergency medical attention is recommended if these signs or symptoms are present.
Unusually, upper respiratory symptoms include wheezing, nasal congestion, or shoulder pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting, coughing, and diarrhea/nussitis have been observed in varying percentages.
In early China, only cases of chest blockage and heart palpitations were reported.
In some, the disease has reached chest inflammation, paralysis of many organs, and death.
This is called the incubation phase.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically six days but may vary between two and 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms have 11.5 days to show symptoms. Reports indicate that not all people who develop symptoms show symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic vectors is not yet known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
The proportion of people infected with the virus who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and under investigation.The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 20% of all confirmed cases remained in hospital without symptoms.
The National Health Commission of China also began recording asymptomatic cases on a daily basis from April 1; 130 or 78% of the 166 people tested for the virus on the same day showed no symptoms.
Both the Lakota and the Bengali had high levels of the virus.
Speaking louder than normal speech releases more droplets.
A study in Singapore found that a whooping cough can transmit oral droplets up to 4.5 metres (15 ft).
Although the virus is not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioviral transmission may be possible and air collectors installed in corridors outside people's rooms found samples that had viral RNA positive.
Some medical procedures, such as piping/injection and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, may cause respiratory secretions to aerosilize and subsequently spread the virus in the air.
Although there are concerns that it is transmitted through waste, the risk is low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; while it is possible to spread before symptoms appear, the risk may be low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says that while it is clear how easily the disease can spread, a person can generally infect two to three people with the virus.The virus survives on surfaces for hours or days.
Specifically, the virus can survive on paper plates for up to a day, on plastic (polypropylene) and iron (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% copper for up to four hours.
However, the survival of the virus on these surfaces is dependent on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents that are used correctly are highly effective; the soap-related material destroys the virus's double-protective coating, inactivates it, and also removes it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solvents, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are also less effective. A study in Hong Kong took samples of the eggs on average two days after admission to hospital.
Of six patients, five of the first sample showed high viral uptake, and the sixth patient showed increased viral uptake on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated in Wuhan from three patients with pneumonia belonging to the acute respiratory syndrome group.
All symptoms of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are inherited in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which breaks the virus's protective coating.The SARS-CoV-2 virus is closely related to the SARS-CoV original strain.
The lungs are the body's most vulnerable organs to COVID-19, as the virus accesses host cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is highly concentrated in lung type II porous cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to bind to the ACE2 enzyme and enter the cells associated with that enzyme.
Acute cardiac arrest was found in 12% of patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and such cases are more common in severe cases.
The progression of cardiovascular disease is characterized by an increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to an inflammatory response and disruption of the immune system, but heart muscle injury may be associated with ACE2 enzyme receptor/receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors/exciters are expressed in the heart and perform their function in the heart.
In the emergency room, COVID-19 patients experienced high levels of blood clots (31%) and venous thrombosis (25%), which may be due to a lack of awareness of the disease.
Although the respiratory system of the SARS-COV-2 virus has a defense system for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 infection have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Specifically, the germline-causing GM-CSF secreting T-cells have been shown to be associated with the accumulation of inflammatory IL-6 secreting monocytes and the detection or pathogenesis of severe lung damage in COVID-19-infected patients.
Lymphocytic enphillitis has also been reported in cadaveric imitations.
The World Health Organization has published several screening protocols for the disease.
Armah-based transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the standard test method.
Typically, the test is performed on respiratory samples obtained by nasopharyngeal tube. However, nasopharyngeal or plantar samples may also be used.
Test results are available between a few hours and two days.
A blood test may be performed, but requires two blood samples, with the second sample taken two weeks after the first sample and the results of each sample taking much less time.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate and genetically sequence the coronavirus with its form/authenticity, allowing laboratories around the world to independently perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect disease through the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (which detects active disease and whether a person has been infected before) was under development, but has not yet been widely used.
The accuracy and precision of the Chinese experiments proved by examination is only 60 to 70 percent.
The United States FDA approved the first test or screening of care for use at the end of this month on 21 March 2020.The diagnostic guidelines issued by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital recommended methods for diagnosing diseases based on clinical signs and epidemiological risk.
Double glazing is common in early onset diseases, with environmental, contrast and final breakdown.
Plural dominance and madness (the swelling of the athlete's scalp with variable swelling of the alveolar or ventral cavities), and co-occurrence may occur as the disease progresses.
Limited data are available on the microscopic incision and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main findings of the autopsy are as follows:
Macroscopy: Pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary edema or accumulation of fluid in the airways and tissues of the lungs.
There are four types of viral bronchitis:
Common pneumonia: pulmonary oedema or accumulation of fluid in the airways and tissues of the lungs, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large irregular pneumocytes, interstitial/acidic inflammation along with lymphocytic enfiltration and the formation of large multi-nucleated cells.
Acute pneumonia: An adverse change in lung structure (DAD) along with inflammatory secretion in the lungs.
Adverse changes in lung structure (DAD) are caused by symptoms of acute respiratory distress disorder (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Recovering pneumonia: inflammatory secretions and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis occur in the lungs.
Blood: large intra-vascular clotting (DIC); locorhublasting reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of contracting the virus include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching mouth, eyes, and toilets with unclean hands.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends covering the mouth and nose with a paper towel when coughing or sneezing.
Proper hand hygiene after any coughing or sneezing.
Also, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends the use of face coverings in public places to reduce the rate of transmission of the virus from a person with symptoms.The goal of social distancing strategies is to reduce the exposure of people with the virus to more people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large public gatherings.
Distance guidelines also require that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8m) apart.
There is no apparently effective treatment for COVID-19 disease. Although a vaccine is not expected until 2021, a key part of preventing the COVID-19 virus is to try to reduce the spread of the disease to a high level, known as "curve cooling".
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly for 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when exposing dead/dirty hands, before eating, and after washing, coughing, and sneezing.
The Center also recommends the use of a 60% alcohol hand sanitizer/sanitizer, but only when soap and water are not readily available.In places where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the World Health Organization offers two locally produced formulas.
In this formula, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used in alcohol to help eliminate bacterial germs. It is "not an active ingredient for killing germs of the hands".
Glycerol is added as a diluent.
People are treated with supportive care. This care includes fluid therapy, oxygenation, and helping other vitally affected organs/tissues.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that people suspected of having the virus wear a simple mask.
External oxygenation of the body (ECMO) is used to address the problem of loss of respiratory function, but the benefits of this method are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are prescribed to strengthen the immune system.
Supportive therapy is helpful for those with normal symptoms in the early stages of the disease.The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for care for people who are hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.
Psychiatrists and pulmonologists in the United States have published treatment recommendations as a free resource from various agencies, including the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some healthcare professionals recommend presetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen as a first use for symptom relief.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially when performing procedures in health facilities, such as piping or hand-ventilating, that can produce particles in the air.
For healthcare workers caring for people with COVID-19 virus, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends standard precautions, including contact precautions and airborne precautions, to accommodate the patient in an airborne virus isolation room (AIIR). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provides guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment during an epidemic.
What are the prescribed items and devices: personal protective medical clothing, respiratory pads or face masks, eyeglasses/eye protection pads, medical gloves/gloves. Where possible, respiratory pads are preferred instead of face masks.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial applications, but the FDA has authorized the use of face masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
These masks are designed to protect against particles such as dust and dust in the air, but are not guaranteed to be effective against a specific biological virus, unless used specifically.
When masks are not available, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends the use of homemade face masks as a last resort.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilators or alternatives, but in some cases these are necessary.
Respiratory assisted forms for the rehabilitation of respiratory failure in COVID-19-related patients are actively being investigated in hospitals.Some evidence suggests that tube insertions should not be used during a bi-directional air positive pressure machine (BiPAP) or a nasal breathing tube.
Whether these two approaches will be equally beneficial for those who are critically ill is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to use a mechanical ventilator by mouth because this technique is more restrictive of airborne particles than a respiratory tube in the nose. Severe cases are more common in white people (over 60, and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for every person, limiting the capacity of the health system to control the sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% of patients were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilator assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30% of COVID-19 patients are eventually admitted to ICU in hospitals.
Mechanical ventilators are further complicated as symptoms of acute respiratory illness in COVID-19 continue to increase and oxygen supply becomes more difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control mode and PEEP capability should increase oxygen delivery, while also reducing the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax associated with the ventilator.
High-level PEEP may not be performed on older ventilators.
Research into possible treatments began in January 2020 and many antiviral drugs are being tested in clinics.
Remedicivir seems to be a very promising drug.
Although development of new drugs may continue until 2021, many of the drugs being tested are already approved for further use or are being tested in an advanced form.
Antiviral drugs may be tested on severely ill patients.
The World Health Organization is asking volunteers to participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of possible treatments.The FDA has temporarily authorized the donation of recovered patient plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the patient's life is critically and urgently threatened.
This experimental treatment has not been tested in clinical trials showing it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, a mobile app was launched in China to help fight the spread of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect "close contacts" and potential risk of infection using surveillance data.
Each user can also view the status of the other three users.
Where possible risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health authorities. Mobile data is used for large-scale data analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile surveillance and artificial intelligence to monitor infected people who have come into contact with people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government asked security agencies to monitor mobile data of people who may have coronavirus.
This measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who may have come into contact with people infected with the virus.
Also in March 2020, Dutch Telecom shared the collected mobile location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to investigate the virus and prevent its spread.
Russia deployed facial recognition technology to identify and locate quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Galliera, said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are moving around".
The German government gave a 48-hour weekend break with more than 42,000 attendees.
Estonian President Kirsty Kolgolid called for five-year solutions to the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience depression from quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or from illness/viruses.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying "increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress, and economic downturn are all hurricanes that are hurting people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may pass normally in the presence or absence of some symptoms and in the presence of other common diseases of the colon, such as the common cold.
Normal cases usually appear within two weeks, while severe and severe cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from viruses similar to SARS and MERS, pregnant women are at high risk for COVID-19 due to the severity of the disease, but there is no data on COVID-19. Some people with COVID-19 may have affected breasts and develop pneumonia.
In severely affected people, the COVID-19 virus can rapidly cause symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that result in respiratory failure, body-wide spread of the virus, and the failure of many organs.
COVID-19-related complications include body-wide spread of the virus, abnormal blood clots, damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clots, especially during prothrombin elevations, have been observed in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while renal dysfunction has been observed in 4% of patients in this group.
An increase in liver transaminase enzyme levels was observed in approximately 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19.
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, plus five days in the hospital.
In addition, the average time between admission and death for people transferred to ICU rooms was seven days.
According to one early case study, the average time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total of six to 41 days between the time of patients' onset of illness and death.
According to a study by the National Health Commission of China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8%, while the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
Postmortem histopathological examination of lung samples showed tissue lesions in both lungs and associated cellular fibromyalgia inflammatory secretion in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic mutations were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image was similar to symptoms of acute respiratory illness.
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, elevated troponin levels and cardiac-related heart disease were overlooked.
In the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients had pre-existing symptoms, according to March data.Access to medical resources and the socioeconomic status of a region may influence mortality.
Estimates of such deaths vary due to regional differences, but also methodological differences.
Showing a low number of normal cases may lead to a higher than expected mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths from infectious diseases have occurred in the past means that current estimates of deaths are understated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to be severely infected with COVID-19 than non-smokers, and nearly 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to the ICU and die.
Hong Kong hospital authorities reported a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in people who had recovered from the disease and showed organ damage in the lung skin.
This may be done on the physical, mental and emotional symptoms of the patient after discharge from the ICU following recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether pre-infection induces effective and long-term immunity in people who recover from the disease.
There is a possibility of a mutation in immunity based on the behaviour of other forms of coronavirus, but cases of people who have recovered from COVID-19 after testing positive for coronavirus have been reported.
The belief about these events is that they cause a persistent disease to get worse rather than a new germ.
The belief about the virus is that it is a natural virus and originates from animals through a wide range of microbes.
The origin is unknown, but in December 2019 the virus began to spread almost completely from human to human.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, showed that the most likely date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
The most likely date of onset of symptoms in official WHO publications was 8 December 2019.
Many measures are commonly used to determine the death toll.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the onset of disease, and population characteristics, such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization used the ICD-10 disease emergency codes.U07.1 code for deaths that were laboratory confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and U07.2 code for deaths that were clinically or epidemiologically confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 virus without laboratory confirmed diagnosis.The death-to-end ratio is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases at a given time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-death ratio is 6.9% as of 17 April 2020.
The numbers vary by region.Other measures include the case fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of those diagnosed who have died from a disease, and the viral mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of those infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died from a disease.
These statistics are not time-based and track specific cases of illness through recovery.
While most patients do not produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide clues as to why so many people become infected with the virus.
A small village at the centre of the outbreak in Italy, Castellane d'Adda, with a population of 4,600, was 80 (1.7%) dead.
In Gangliat, the disease spread through carnival festivals, and to the younger population with a relatively low mortality rate and thus the deaths of all those infected with COVID-19 may not have been officially hidden.
Moreover, the German healthcare system was not yet under pressure.
Based on the evaluation of blood donors, probably 3% of the population in the Netherlands had antibodies.
69 confirmed deaths (0.004% of the total population) from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and the mortality rate differ between women and men.
Research in China and Italy shows that mortality rates are higher in men.
Their risk age for men is 50 years, with the gap between men and women closing only at age 90.
The mortality rate in China was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact reason for this gender difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be attributed.
Sex-based immunological differences, with a lower prevalence in women than in men, and the presence of multiple diseases simultaneously in men than in women, such as hypertension in adolescence, can lead to an increase in their mortality.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government did not monitor gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS viral diseases affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease should be "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that the name CO in this name comes from the coronavirus, virus VI, D disease and 19 when the disease was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geography (such as China), species, or group of people. The name was chosen in accordance with international recommendations aimed at preventing contamination. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the World Health Organization has used "COVID-19 virus" and "virus causing COVID-19" in its generic descriptions.
Both the disease and the virus are collectively referred to as "coronavirus".
At the time of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization's 2015 Guidelines on Places Named for Diseases and Viruses gave the temporary names 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory illness for the virus and disease.
The official names, COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2, were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers make sanitary items and items such as kitchen cotton swabs and respirators.
For example, when a hospital in Italy needed a respirator helmet, and the supply company could not provide it in time, a new operating company made 100 helmets in one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, false theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease were circulated and spread rapidly on the Internet.
Humans can transmit and transmit viruses to certain animals.
Studies failed to find evidence of viral symptoms in quail, duck, and chickens.
No drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
Global research on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments is ongoing by government agencies, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "risk assessment" to evaluate the potential effects of four existing antiviral compounds in the hope of efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but many agencies are actively developing vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being exploited as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccine development strategies are under investigation.
The first strategy is to develop a vaccine for the entire virus.
The purpose of using such a virus, whether it is inactivated or dead, is to stimulate the body's rapid immune response to the novel COVID-19 virus.
The second strategy is to develop sub-vaccines that aim to develop a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system against subcomponents of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies focus on the S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for making a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines from each of these strategies should be used to assess safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine was initiated in Seattle on four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent enhancement has been proposed as a possible challenge to the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but this has caused much debate.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been conducted.
Seven trials evaluated pre-approved treatments for malaria, four of which were conducted on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Many Chinese studies have included the study of other diseases, with nine/nine Phase III trials of Remedicivir reportedly underway in many countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic clinical development study for COVID-19 vaccine and drugs has been conducted.Many existing antiviral drugs are under evaluation and research for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remedicivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lupinevir/eritnavir and lupinevir/retonavir, as well as Interferon beta.
There is experimental evidence of the effectiveness of Remedicivir as of March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in the treatment of patients recovering from reduced use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China, and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was taken under investigation in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
Nevertheless, a joint review of the study is called for.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
In addition, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a one-gram dose per day, notes that taking a dose of this drug twice a day is extremely dangerous and potentially fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use order for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 infected patients at the request of doctors.The Chinese Seventh Edition of Guidelines also mentioned the use of interferon, ribavirin, or youmifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high-dose ribavirin is required to thicken SARS-CoV-2 in test sites.
Nitazoxanide scavenging studies were recommended in laboratories after showing low levels of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration.Studies showed that high levels of protein pumping through transmembrane protease serine 2 are important for the insertion of SARS-CoV-2 via binding to the ACE2 receptor.
Research on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin has been severely limited, preventing the health community from using it in therapeutic studies without further investigation.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in test sites and has no apparent role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytotoxic storms can complicate health conditions in the severe and late stages of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytotoxin properties.The National Health Commission of China also included the drug tosilezomab in its treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
After showing positive results in severe patients, a nationwide Phase 2 randomized trial is underway in Italy.
This test, which is related to serum ferritin blood testing for cytokine cysts, is intended to prevent developments that are thought to be fatal in some affected patients.
An interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine symptoms caused by any isolated cause, CAR T cell, 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tosilezomab is considered an effective treatment for CRS.
Transmission of soft and solid antibodies produced by the immune system of COVID-19 recovered individuals to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccination method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS without results.
Virus inhibition is a predictable mechanism of action based on inactivated antibody therapy that strengthens the immune system against SARS-CoV-2.
But other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or fugasitosis are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy using monoclonal antibodies are also being developed.
Serum production from recovered patients, which involves extracting fluid from the blood of recovered patients and using specific antibodies to the virus, can increase the number of them to spread rapidly in the body.
Coronavirus, a group of related symptoms
Li Wenliang, a Wuhan Central Hospital doctor who was raising awareness about the spread of the virus, contracted the COVID-19 virus and died.
