This not only confirms that dinosaurs had feathers, a widespread theory, but generally there are no fossils to support evidence, for example of color and three-dimensional shapes.
The scientists say that the appearance of the animal's fur is brownish-beanish on top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
The discovery also provided insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have well-developed stems, called rachis, but had other feathered characteristics  spiny-barbels and barbule-barbels  researchers conclude that rachis is likely a later evolutionary development that is another characteristic.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather to regulate temperature or appearance.
Researchers suggest that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult fur and not a tail.

The work done was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The changes that the team members were looking for were caused by tidal forces between the invisible matter of the galaxy and the invisible matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts its gravitational pull on the earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert its force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that this invisible matter influences other matter in a similar way to other visible matter.
The theory states that a large amount of dark matter around a galaxy is surrounded by a galaxy in a kind of light circle, and is made up of very small particles.

In France the election has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a room, handing a sheet of pre-printed paper showing the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the official checks the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope inside the ballot box and signs the voter roll.

Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following certain procedures.

The Crown Office, which is in full charge of the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until charges are brought.
The document, according to reports, would outline the boundary issue, which the Palestinians wanted under the 1967 pre-Middle East War boundaries.
Other reported topics discussed included the shape of a future Jerusalem that would be sacred to all nations and the affairs of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded the arrival of the Syrian refugees in the valley within ten years after agreeing to name them when the PA agreed to leave their presence for only five years.
Gunners in pest control tests must be closely monitored by supervisors, as these exercises are monitored and evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Rifles Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., eligible volunteers are recruited, under the Sporting Rifles Association grima programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage Parks with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received full safety instructions and training.
Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the temporary resignation of the CEP as part of a package of actions to bring the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods that were unusable due to heat have been reported, causing six fires and injuring four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Industry and Trade (METI) says that at least 27 accidents have been caused by the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional accidents due to heat, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling the report by Apple "really disturbing".
The earthquake occurred in the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (09.19 GMT Friday night).
The Northern Mariana emergency management office said no damage was reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no tsunami warning.
A former Filipino police officer holds a Hong Kong tourist hostage by hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages were released and at least six were declared dead so far.
Six fugitives, including children and elderly, were released early, as well as Filipino portraitists.
The photographer then took the place of an old woman when she (the woman) needed a bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital Liggins began investigating preterm births during her time off.

Xinhua reported that government investigators found two black boxes of flight voice recorders on Wednesday.
The gulet companions also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on the afternoon of the second moon. Quite unique as she was. Strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that Luna is as strange as I am...maybe even more...love her and will miss her...I hope she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people who voted in the 2010 federal election, those who disagreed with Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard admitted during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign.
34 percent of those who voted in favour of the proposal wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch in Australia.
At the end of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist will swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but her swimming abilities are in doubt.
He was not allowed to take medication to deal with his pain as it was banned in the match.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest known prime number as of January 25.
Some people tested the invention using different software and hardware in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water delivery to the earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, because in the past comets collided with Earth.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and has been addressing demands for same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors corn and political stupidity.
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly on shorter runways and save millions of gallons of fuel per year and cut carbon footprint.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to show aircraft with higher accuracy and give pilots more complete details.
No additional transport is being undertaken and the overground train will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and on-street parking-and-ride facilities are not available.
The fear of a lack of vehicles increases the chances that the game will have to be played with a delinquent without the support of his supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Research from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reports that the new species of megar has only existed for two generations, although this method is believed to be much older, as it exists among the Darwin endemic finch, Geospiza fortress, and the boyongan finch cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into any shape. It can be rolled into any small shape.
It can be made into very thin wires, which can be threaded and embedded.
It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to print hand-painted images in books called naskah or ornamented .
You can make a pointer using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical compound is.
This pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the test chemical.
A hydrogen ion is a proton from which electrons are ejected (because the hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Whip the two dry powders together and then, with wet clean hands, remes it into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will absorb the outer layer, which will make it feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have flat toilets in almost every home, which are connected to modern trash disposal procedures.
Remains of sewage systems are found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
The satellite was in space receiving a call and then pointing this down again, almost immediately.
Satellites are launched into space by rocket.Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere bends some of the light and their view of themselves.
It takes a huge rocket 100 feet high to lift a satellite or telescope into the sky.
The wheel has changed the world in a good way. The biggest thing is that it has created a vehicle that is simple and also fast.
This has resulted in trains, automobiles, and many other means of transportation.
Below that are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey from cats to ferrets and kittens.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat more small prey such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The key to its success is the concept of position, a special artifact that each cat possesses that prevents cats from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called pride.
The group consists of one to three adult male lions, and about thirty female and male lions.
Female lions are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion buffalo act like a pack of wolves or dogs, strange animals that resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also deadly to their prey.
A brilliant athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump for long distances, and crawl with the strength of five humans.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The roar of a tiger is not the roar of a lion with a full voice, but rather the roar of a terrifying phrase and a scream of words.
They will catch monkeys, snakes, rats and birds if they can.
Scientists think that ocelot cats follow and also find their prey (the prey) by their smell, smelling their grounded habitat.
They can see in the dark with their night vision, and can also move silently.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (as if they were moving across a mountain range or river, or if they were moving to a new island so that they could not move again easily) they will often find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new populations will need a different look or adaptation to be stronger competitors than they did before.
The original population did not change at all, they still needed the same support as before.
Over time, as new populations began to adapt to their new surroundings, they began to appear and not be like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means a new form of species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans absorb, and take up the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe).
Trees make their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are lined with over 70 thin teeth, and also with additional teeth above the lip, meaning there is no way out for anything that is blocking its path.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that the tongue had two branches.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex would not have been its match.
Although the gold of all the cuisines there would be common to themselves, the Romans did have some strange or unusual food items including, wild boar, peacocks, geese, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while a poor man and woman share their food by sitting on a chair, a rich man likes to share where they sit by the fire while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include the food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built major temples for their gods, which they considered to be the homes of the gods.
People would bring offerings to the gods and priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies or festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner bathroom that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special towers curving around the pyramid, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple.
The top part of the tower was a place of special protection for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the home was not a necessity.
Many Hebrew families lived outside their territory.
Women carry the bags in the courtyard; the stalls are just open trading tables facing the street. The stones are used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the timber was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely inhabited. In Norse mythology they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and that on his journey further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But no matter how it was found, the Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each country is Scandinavia, there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the National Treasure movie, you might think of a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
The letter, though written on the back, is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, a large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inch by 241⁄2 inch) was rolled up for preservation.
Therefore, it is highly likely that the notes were added only for the label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was led by the French "Vichy". He was a Frenchman who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked for the occupiers rather than against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, a move dubbed Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, American and Free French troops had liberated southern France and were returning to Germany.
A civilization is a single custom held by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, in relation to the Latin civis, meaning population, and civitas, meaning city or urban state, which is how a city can determine the size of a society.
The city-state is the forerunner of the state.The culture of a civilization implies a heritage of cross-generational insight, a lasting cultural legacy and equitable dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as a civilization in their own right.
During the Revolutionary War, the first thirteen states formed a weak central government with Congress being the only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacks the power to impose taxes, and, with no national enforcement or judiciary, relies on the state government, which is often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
It also has no authority to raise taxation and price rules between member states.
All member states must agree to the Article before it can be amended and these other members view the central government as being undervalued because their representatives are too often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team is the second most successful team in the world and the 2006 FIFA world cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, pit-pitching, ice hockey, wheelchair hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the North, with Italy taking part in international races and Olympic events.
Japan controls nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
The presence of island groups in Japan, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "island" country
Taiwan began in the 15th century when European fishermen passed through and named the island Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a base in the southern tip of Taiwan, which began a transformation in the practice of indigenous grain production and sent Chinese workers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated by the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Many of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of the initial things therefore.
By 1976, thirty percent of Macchu Picchu had been restored and continued to the present day.
For example, the world's most common still image photography format is 35mm, where it was the dominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but the more important aspect ratio has been inherited by the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35mm is actually, somewhat confusingly, a 36mm and 24mm wide.
The aspect ratio of this format (which is multiplied by twelve to produce the simplest numerical ratio) is therefore 3:2.
More common formats (e.g., the APS family formats) are similar to or close to this aspect ratio.
The third most-often-abused rule is a simple guide when creating dynamism while also maintaining a sense of order within the image.
This suggests that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see for example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which was in turn becoming wealthy and seduced, came under scrutiny.
Over a thousand years ago, Christianity united the nations of Europe despite their different languages and cultures.
These are all about the power that influences everyone from the king to me.
One of the basic principles of Christianity is that the money should be used to help those in need, and the church funds are there for that purpose.
The central church authority had never been to Rome for a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many wonder whether this principle had been followed.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
This policy proved powerful, and manced important military and civilian supplies, although this siege violated the generally accepted international laws governed by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
The British planted mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering the sea area, endangering neutral shipping.
Given the limited response to this plan, the Germans expected a similar response of unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, actions taken by citizens and nationals were against war and also against isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations hoped to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States because he accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (manager of his previous work) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had an unusual way of referring to the era; each level of China or each ruling house was a distinctive dynasty.
The most prominent of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
This period of bitter warfare occurred when many noble bloodlines seized the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history as thousands of people died fighting for the top seat in the great palace of Xian.
There was a great deal of influence from social and political conditions such as the usefulness of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belonged to all rather than just to a single leader.
Also after the Revolution the work was opened to all male applicants allowing for the most ambitious and successful to have results.
The same applies to the military as army ranks as a whole are based on their class they are now based on their caliber.
The French Revolution also gave impetus to many oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad used to be very interested in things beyond this life. He often went to the cave now known as the Cave of Hira on Mount Noor (the light) to meditate.
He in his own cave, which survived at the time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Perched on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know it's there.
There is nothing to see except the amazing sky, the clear sky above and the many mountains around it.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of a number of pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Dead Valley has several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
A large pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family.
The "high arrow" mark looks like the letter V and the "low arrow mark" looks like the contents of staples or missing boxes at the bottom.
Up means you have to start from the top and push the barbell, and down means you have to start from the frog (where your hand is holding the barbell) and pull the barbell.
The curve above this notation usually produces a softer sound, and the check mark above this notation usually produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
Feel free to write on your own mark, but remember that the curved corner markings that are due to the music, so it is usually worth respecting.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoniette and their two young sons (eleven-year-old Marie Theresa and four-year-old Louis Charles) and the King's frightened sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
In the carriage, he returned to Paris surrounded by a mob of people shouting and shouting insults at the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the wide windows of their chariot.
At one point, a member of the society was beheaded by a royal official who was killed at Versailles in front of the queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to pay for the country's large purchases and the interest of the floating bonds to the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking house.
Of course, the huge profits that came from its long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would be the fundamental advantage of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the order.
The High Middle Ages was a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300) in which events took place on a regular basis.
The High Middle Ages is preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a phrase that refers to many thoughts for practice, from the support of a technology or technology that should exist to a strong sense that human destiny is supported by a mind that is fundamentally linked to scientific rules and their manifestation to technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two common views: that technological development itself follows a path that is generally not influenced by culture or politics, and that technology also has "effects" on a single society, rather than being driven by social conditions.
For example, some might say that the engine was the first thing that man would build on a road.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of driving a car.
The mass car ownership also led to more accidents on the roads, which created new techniques for caring for and repairing broken car bodies.
The romantic literary style has many elements of cultural determinism, exemplified by authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures associated with such geography emerged, and these, in keeping with the place of society, were preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern age, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of ancient Europe.
It was famous for its fine tourist centers from about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status was denied in the twelfth century due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with items such as silk and ampoons that were worth more than what the Byzantine market offered.
At that time the move of the Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was in progress.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east
However, due to the slow communication channels, the western style may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages western Europe began to develop its own style. One result of the changes that occurred during this period was the result of the crusades when many people began to use the bunting to tighten their clothes.
Self-sufficient farming is agriculture that is undertaken to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Livelihood farming is a simple, often organic, method of using seeds that are native to an ecoregion that are stored in combination with crop rotation or a simple method of growing them.
The majority of farmers are heavily involved in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
The cultural branch brings together like-minded people who feel ignored by social rank and can foster a sense of identity.
Cultural branches can be differentiated by the age, ethnicity, class, place, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a branch of culture may be language, aesthetics, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a cultural branch often mark their membership by using distinctive and symbolic styles, which include dress, behavior, and dialect.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take advantage of the less-favoured cases of children who, ignored, bullied, intentionally abused, were not talked about by adults as children.
Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases these children are abandoned due to the parents' refusal to allow the child severe intellectual or physical harm.
The wayward child may have been abused as a child or may have been afraid before being abandoned or before running away.
Others are thought to be brought by animals; a few are said to live alone in the wild.
When treated by non-human keans, the child shows wild behavior (with some limitations) almost like the treatment of its primary animal, such as fear and even a sense of indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, the scaffolding goes further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but an aid that provides support to people who have new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding but also a small paperclip that is present in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in software and is intended to ask, ask, and explain behaviors that can challenge students to handle on their own.
The children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even coercion.
No child is supposed to grow up in a situation where they are not cared for, cared for and educated, but they are.
We feel the Child Protective Services are a safe zone for these children.
Storage systems should provide a safe home, a loving caregiver, regular maintenance, and reliable healthcare storage.
The child's speaker must meet all the missing needs in the home taken from the previous children.
The Internet combines elements of group and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet lead to an additional dimension in the terminology of its use and approach to gratification.
For example, learning and socialization are proposed as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and continuous engagement were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has produced important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that span milliseconds.
In particular, it is stated that one can discover that a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, points out how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately judge the sincerity of their hearts.
He even suggests that such abilities within the negation of human behavior could be possessed by animals such as pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic sexes: hidden and revealed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes these from the group of variations it expresses.
Segregation and recombination of random sexes alternate between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system similar to humans to meet their amino acid needs from readily available plant sources.
Moreover, such failure can lead to serious consequences: depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources are proteins that can be easily obtained from the inside of leaves and pods, but these plants are very difficult to digest by primates such as humans unless the plant is cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but they provide high-quality protein that contains all the necessary amino acids.
After considering it, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved the protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and returning to sleep again within a short period of time (10-60 minutes)
This can be done easily by using a slightly elongated clock that can wake you up without waking you up to a shock.
If you find yourself setting up a birthday clock in your bedroom, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up from your seat to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink plenty of water (especially water or tea, known as to spit a lot of spit) before bed, forcing the person to wake up to spit.
The amount of peace a person has is directly correlated to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The longer it lasts, the better the life force it is. Everyone can find unending peace and joy.
The only thing standing in the way of this aspiration is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhist teachings, but developed by the path of Mahayana love and by all the methods of Indian Yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple, including Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path to embrace all love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the power of awakening) is raised through yoga poses, breathing exercises, spells and shadows.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the God of Yoga. Through the visualization of various gods, the energy streams are cleansed, chakras are turned on and the consciousness of the incarnation is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
With the end of the war two years ago, former allies now became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would be for 40 years to come and it would be fought with all its might, by all-powerful armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defences were broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge base.
However, the draft was made that night, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian armies immediately after the violent invasion of eastern Poland by the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, all bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to move goods is the most effective way to move large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, but at the same time, disrupt your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic military operation for World War II. The Americans attempted to move men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid the British.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, tried to stop her.
If the Allies failed, Germany might be able to defeat Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Sheep are thought to have been first cruelly domesticated 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to make it easier to find routes for milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Sheep were generally kept in herds of animals that roamed the hills or other areas, often kept by shepherds who were often children or teenagers, much like the common shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although trench rails consist only of parallel wooden planks, they can allow horses to pull trenches to move faster and pull larger loads than on slightly rougher roads.
Rail bearing was introduced early to hold the rails in place, but it was later discovered that the rails would be more efficient if they had iron on top.
This became common practice, but eventually led to more use of wooden wheel parts in coaches.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels.
The first known vehicles were walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright humans).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk vertically on a daily basis.
Two-legged stopping is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs rapidly within the last seven million years.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be a barrier to reducing future suffering to some degree.
It's just like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want a temporary solution, then we have to find the source of the problem, and we have to inactivate it completely.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the advancement of human science and technology, and the problems are becoming greater due to the excess population and the wasteful lifestyle of humans.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a text of the contents was signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson and sent several blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap spread.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, which he read to his troops in New York on 9 July.
25 The only known copy of Dunlap's tract is a complete copy of his document, the original manuscript of which has been lost.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Many people say that this animal is not a dinosaur because it has fur and can fly.
But there are still many parts of the bird that look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulation of information generated by coding in binary numerical form.
Twin digits can have only one or two ranks, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are called twin digits - or bits, which uses computer jargon.
Toxicity from within may not be immediately apparent.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open medicine container or a household chemical that contains the poison.
Check the label for first aid instructions for any poisonous poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in the formal sense for this group of insects.
The word derives from an ancient affinity with bed bugs, which are highly adapted insects that parasitize humans.
Killer and bed bugs are both altricial, adapted to living in the shelter or home of their hosts.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a prominent neurological disease in middle-aged and young adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
The couple may decide that it is not in their desired interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise the baby.
These couples can choose to make adoption plans for their babies.
In an adoption, the biological parent terminates their parental rights so that another spouse may become the parent of the child.
The main goal of science is to explain how the world works from the scientific method.
Not only that, experiments, and tests are methods used to dismiss one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations as well as guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers paid close attention to ancient writings and, in particular, the Latin gospels.
Aristotle's views are acceptable to all areas of science, including psychology.
As Greek science declined, the West broke away from Greek roots scientifically and philosophically.
Many observations of rhythm in physiology and behavior often depend heavily on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic warming, not merely a response to periodic outbreaks, has been proven to be true for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-propelled oscillator that will continue to run pit-free even without signals from outside.
Harshey and Chase's experiment was one of the main elements that led to the idea that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fags, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
He made two experiments marking DNA fags with radioactive phosphorus or protein fags with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, meaning the genetic material that is affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations within the cells of multicellular organisms can be passed on to the offspring, and mutations elsewhere can cause cancer or cell death.
Nature-based sightseeing attracts many people who want to go on a nature trip to observe the landscape, including the trees as well as the wildlife.
Examples of in-place activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and researching ecosystems.
For example, visiting, taking photos, and learning about the organgatuangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small towns by car to work and meet people who work in the small town.
In this dynamic round-trip transportation everyone is working on how to connect, and support, a transportation system based on private cars.
Current knowledge suggests that this huge carbon economy has been pushing back the biosphere from one of the solid states that have supported human expansion for the past two million years.
Everyone is involved in the society and uses the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same complaints about the quality of water or bridges.
Why does the transportation system make people complain, why does the system fail every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more basic?
Traffic flow is a lesson about the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
The problem is that the driver's habits are not so controlled that they can be controlled.
Fortunately, condom drivers behave fairly consistently; therefore, condom traffic delays have understandable and mathematically demonstrable correlations.
To better describe traffic flow, a relationship has been defined between three key conditions: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in planning, designing and operating highway facilities.
The ability to fly helps them to avoid predators and to find food and mate more easily.
Most insects long benefit from the ability to fold their wings back together.
This gives them a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the toucan and the toucan fly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people think they are free but many believe otherwise; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It makes sense, because the earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the largest river in the World, with a width of six miles.
About 20 percent of the water that flows out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long.
Although building pyramids using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza never exceeded their size and the ingenuity of their construction methods.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt was marveled at the monuments of its ancestors, which at the time had remained intact for more than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and communicates with the diocese.
Italian was also the language of the working class and Latin was often used for religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they are all found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything in the world was made up of a mixture of four elements: earth, water, wind, and fire.
This is very similar to the problem of the four states of matter (in a similar way): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also assumes that they change into new matter to form what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
It can also have alloys that have small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of atoms could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Then, the pencil became a good companion for the crowd when they went out.
Meanwhile, as new writing methods have emerged, pencils have been relegated to shorter conditions and uses.
People now write messages on a computer screen, never having to come closer to get closer.
One can only wonder what the typewriter will be like when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb is ignited on the principle that energy is needed to combine a nucleus that is rich in protons and neutrons.
It's like shaking a heavy rock up a hill, splitting the nucleus again and releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to break up with little or no thrust.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust.
The crater can be seen about 70 km away and 100 km away.
It is thinner below the marshes and thicker below the mountains.
It may have more lava on its side because its crust is thinner.
Content theory is central to finding out what makes people choose or attract.
The theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are already internalized when they enter adulthood.
These theories observe what is going on with certain people that makes them want to do what they do and what things in their environment that will make them do or not do certain actions.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's Hierarchical Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, both actions can be seen when a manager starts to lead his former teammates to his blessing.
This type of manager has difficulty making unsolicited decisions, taking orderly action, honoring work, delegating responsibilities, and demanding accountability from people.
At the other end of the spectrum, a morph becomes an unidentified individual who feels he (a man) or she (a woman) must change everything the group has done and make it his own.
Either way, the leader takes absolute responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often creates a gap between leaders and other team members.
Virtual squads have similar benchmarks of excellence to conventional squads, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members are often the point of contact for the immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular squad members because of the value of meeting different time zones that may be unfamiliar to the venue manager.
The existence of an invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
An invisible team is a management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process of establishing a teaching organization? One of the goals of implementing the idea of teaching an organization into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used with good results in all functional parts of the organization, creativity and agility can occur.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome a hurdle can lead to a new innovation process to serve the needs of its subscribers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation and also be able to share knowledge and learning in an organizational way.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum method as a practice used to help organizations achieve higher employment.
Neurobiological data provide real evidence for how to prove the theory of consciousness checking.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists to investigate.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and are the cause of the decline of some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that were previously unknown.
It also provides us with a wealth of information and material to build a biased projection model that helps us understand how our minds work.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI creates a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation within a machine.
Research is on Al except for creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, design and statement, a smile to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
That's what it's become a different discipline, one that focuses on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, machinery and agriculture, as they are built into many home computer devices and gaming applications.
The field school is an important part of the classroom, and the teacher usually takes the students to places where the bus cannot pass.
Technology offers solutions by virtualizing field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or marvel at beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip is actually a way to describe a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina create a web about traveling to the State Capital, each year the web is modified, but the old version remains online so it can be used as a template book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogging experience with a messy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical readers, bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
It also encourages students to be more aware of the world around them. The need to be aware of the curiosity of these visitors inspires students to be active and entertaining (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to expand their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more exploratory and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can determine their place in the context of other people's writings and clarify their own views on a particular issue (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city and boasts a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls and to the north are the sites of untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more highlight Ontario as what is considered quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas of the north are sparsely populated and some are largely forested.

It is bordered to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended to tell a woman who travels to say that she is married, regardless of what their actual marital status is.
This helps to also wear rings (only the ones that look expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to reluctance and that they are not used to being followed, held in the arms, etc.
That means rejecting a man, and not being afraid to stand up for yourself in your community (cultural or otherwise, it doesn't work!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the building and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt his city under the name of Daru l-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who were able to build a trading base there.
