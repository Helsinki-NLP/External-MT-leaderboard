“Beautiful Munich” 2018!
The afternoon again awaits a surprise for our candidates: they will not fight the romantic Candlelight shooting before MY SOLARIS alone, but on the side of the male model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, cocktailing, seducing - no easy tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine “Beautiful Munich” candidates give up the shooting with the people’s photographer Tuan and resist the wind, the wind and the rain as real professionals.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil's return
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
“This is a question that, of course, depends on that one once comes into conversation, that one also talks to him about why he apparently felt that one or the other as it is set in his statement,” Grindel said in the football podcast “Phrasenmäher” of the “Bild-Zeitung.”
Despite the months of debate about the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the 92nd national player Özil's resignation.
“I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I’ve also predicted to a certain point that this would be the case,” Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his withdrawal from the DFB team in July and also justified it by not being defended by Grindel against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with federal manager Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn’t want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so that if you’re leaving a team or changing a team, you’ll talk about it with your coach and I’m sorry that this conversation has not happened so far.”
Linz: Gardenhouse in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 14.13 a.m. the professional firefighter Linz was alarmed for a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, the danger was in delay.
The firefighters went out and found the house in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically to the end and the firefight had to be cleaned to the necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden house, he had infected a battery to the store in the afternoon.
This may be the cause of fire.
According to firefighters, the carrier was in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be identified, as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable because the owner had a lot of collector pieces in his garden house.
Fearful Mother Defends: Lindsay Lohan Attails Refugees' Family On Open Street
What did Lindsay Lohan lead to this strange action?
She wanted to bring the children to a alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, “Herbie: Fully Loaded”) has directed as she seems to want to bring the children to a family in Moscow.
This is by the U.S. portal “TMZ” and publishes a partial cutting of the stream.
Here you can see "To Happiness Kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan coming out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to have made as a refugee family from Syria.
As the family escapes from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
It is intended to engage in adult child trade.
For all of this, he does not provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees it right now," Lohan is heard in the video as she continues to pursue the family along the street.
Obviously, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan loses an ear.
Under tears, the actress follows how shocked she is - and she keeps her wing.
What Lohan has driven to this action is currently completely unclear.

Protests in Brazil against Bolsonaro.
“Ele Nao” means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands went on the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.

His strongest rival is Fernando Haddad from the Labour Party.
Audi: “Dieselgate” processing takes longer than planned
“The Diesel taskforce is still there,” said development director Peter Mertens to the industry newspaper ‘Automobile Week’.
In December 2017, Audi’s chief executive, Rupert Stadler, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
“In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/power combinations are expected to be tested,” he said at that time.
Mertens said: “At the beginning of July we have achieved an important step goal in addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer has made “gravating organizational changes” so that such a scandal will never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Council has denied a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue to discuss on Tuesday.
The investigative authorities call on the Audi chief to have authorized the sale of diesel cars with false emission values after the emission fraud was revealed.
He was aware of the manipulations or consciously ignored them.
Currently, sales director Bram Schot is the company’s chief executive officer.
Due to the transition to the new WLTP emissions and consumption control standard, there are production failures in Audi, Schot told "Heilbronner Voice".
Basically, he sees a declining demand for limousines such as the Audimodels A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in neccarism.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Shoot is based on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel wants to re-elect Lahm to the DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup out and the Özil case, will again be nominated for the office of DFB President next year.
“I’m doing my job and I’m trying to make them as good as possible,” Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning in the ZDF’s “Actual Sports Studio”.
You have to try again and again, I’m going to do that.
Then we need to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association finds it "markable" if he does not "will be willing to collaborate on the future project" after the addition for the 2024 World Cup.
Grindel has since April 2016 been the head of the association as a successor of the Wolfgang Niersbach affair over the summer mark.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm will work with the DFB presidency.
“I would be glad if my colleagues in the presidency agree that he will be advised in this role in the presidency in the future and then, of course, he will be warmly invited to provide his experience in sports matters,” Grindel said.
At speculations whether Lahm could become his successor as the DFB head, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that in the future a national player without a migration background should become DFB’s integration ambassador.
Currently, this office is exercised by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
“If one without a migration background significantly influences society and football and says, ‘the topic is important, then we have to take care,’ that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our teams in the place where integration needs to work,” Grindel said.
Right weight loss with half-clear weight
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A weight that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat proportion.
Muscle and bone mass can also show it.
The body mass index calculates the thing as well, but it is rather for the wheat.
He doesn’t tell me if I’ve replaced fat with muscles.

Erdogan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdogan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdogan urged the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to act against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
“We will not allow the PKK or the Gülen movement to shoot our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the centre of Cologne was partially closed.
Thousands of police officers were employed, including firearms.
The Islamic Federation Ditib is criticized because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Books and Shrek Seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes, and Cardi B, in a joint concert in Central Park, New York, called for more engagement in the fight against poverty and diseases.
“Member yourself wherever you can,” Mendes said at the festival in the night to Sunday in front of around 60.0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and a golden microphone.
I’m nervous, I sweat, but it’s okay because I’m here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations appeared on stage at the multi-hour show.
Meanwhile, however, there was a scream second when many spectators kept the noise of a crashing metal lock for shootings, feared and tried to escape.
In short, panic arose, people were disappointed.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, organizer Hugh Evans said.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed the people out of the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You are all in safety.
Tickets for the “Global Citizen Festival” concert were available online for free as each year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and spread on the Internet texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was a pleasure and applause from the audience - bullying on the contrary for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality for men and women.
But on Friday, Flake spoke in the U.S. Senate’s Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, and so many women hit the head.
At least three women have raised accusations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which Kavanaugh refuses.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the accusations after two women who, according to their own reports, have experienced sexual assault, faced him on the way to the committee in an elevator.
“You can come with me in an elevator at any time,” Flake told the audience at the concert in New York.
Press Freedom: Federal Government Defends Journalist's Dispute
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the draft of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had taken a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption in the course of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has caused a strong discomfort, which is unacceptable.
This is why he has caused the guard to bring the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor's office.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Several journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged spy activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gulen movement.
The Turkish leadership makes the movement responsible for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also uncertain before the Turkish authorities: It was not until early September that Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Lastly, the cases of the detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had been monitored.
Though they came free and could return to Germany, there are still trials against the two in Turkey.
Florian David Fitz drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-looking his fans normally know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, it’s really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The NDR-produced Talkshow "Inas Nacht" is known for moist pleasant conversations at the theke of the Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller met with her guests on some beer, some wine or even higher-percentage drinks to boost the mood and the tongue.
Not a few promises also drink courage for the mandatory singing deposits.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz is famous for films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Worst Day".
The tour of Munich to the high north was not good.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely scratched on it, the eyes are only two small slides.
The bed selfie shows a full-fledged Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only a powerful cat.
Directed to his fans, he posted some — probably not quite serious — findings that he has now won: “Rule one: DO NOT go to Inas night.
Rule 2: Never drink the black sauce.
and Spritz.
And the round egg liqueur, which Ina smells at half three, also leaves away.
Alcohol consumption is actually written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to fight the torture.
They were enough of instant brews, fish brews or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others just entertained with the view of the normally attractive cinema star.
How Ina Müller has survived the night sailing is not known so far.
Since she has moderated the TV entertainment at the theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
A beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and wrath
The entrance to the 36-kilometre long railway in the Redkupchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and conceal.
Recipes against grazing vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly found.
Wipes, cigarette pipes, waste and rubbish, demolished rubbish and now demonstrated indicators – this is what has been presented since the long entrance with a seat group to the bicycle road on the Haaße hill in Treysa.
For the predictive object Railway in Red Copenhagen a more than unpleasant view.
The topic is concerned by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the city’s cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The issue has already been discussed in the Cycling Council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals range from the placement of the seat group to the regular cleaning of the waste containers and the cleaning of the areas at the starting point.
"I think the last would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also entered the issue into the local council.
Not only the waste moves cyclists and inhabitants - the seat group is a regular meeting point to celebrate on weekends.
Not only does it often go loudly, in the plagues it is also destroyed: posters are cut out of the earth, molds are demolished, labels are scratched, seat furniture is shattered.
Volunteers have already been cleaning more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the speech-written drops on the hot stone.
They’re angry that the Rastplatz on the bicycle road in Treysa is a meeting point for sailing.
"Thro the entire cycling route, the focus is clearly here on the Haaße hill," the cycling officer confirms, who is now taking care of the new cycling station in Ziegenhain, which is open today.
“If they suffer the same fate, it will be really expensive.”
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: “Maybe this puts the threshold significantly higher to engage in the community.
However, this would require a police strike to pass in time.
Basically, desert hagen wishes a development of the Haaße hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
With the frequency of the cycling to date, you can be very pleased.
Tourism marketing is still expanding.
Our bicycle path is very high quality compared to others in Germany,” the ADFC members say.
As an extremely critical point of danger, ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation in the Ascheröder Street in Treysa.
There is no breakthrough on the hill.
In the case of smooth traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the bilateral traffic flow,” she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Culture Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the Lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and together.
“To offer a song for Hiltrup” is the call of the city-to-offensive Hiltrup, in the “music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians.”
A contest "with eye wings in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering at coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Cultural Railway Court.
Seven formations took place, from the One-Man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with Guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long in Hiltrup living Albachtener, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors", three members and three generations of the families Drenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the Lummerland Kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Quarties.
This contest, the district mayor Joachim Schmidt said, is a novelty.
We haven’t seen this in other towns.
What are the texts linked to?
At the locations, the Hiltruper Lake and the Marketallee were frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig curated the allee in his striking song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also honored.
It was repeatedly about experiencing each other in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke lived the short transformations with short interviews with the interpreters or indications about their creation.
Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all the hands on YouTube.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others can also hear their songs.
A whole CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers of guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the kids came to the final again - and they sounded "really good" even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, enthusiasm of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Union, as well as Jan Kaven, the chairman of the town of the offensive.
The city offensive initiated the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She appreciated the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: “Decrypto” in the game test
The players form two teams that face each other.
For each side there is a screen, in which four cards with keywords, which you can decrypt - the old trick with the red film - only when you have inserted it.
Thus it is guaranteed that the opposite side can read nothing even by mistake.
On the maps there is, for example, to read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
The second window.
The Third Cube.
The Fourth Party.”
These are the terms that must be encrypted.
This is not the terms, but the codes.
A player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that may be "3.4.2".
"Decrypto" is not the terms behind the secret file, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He must - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "worms", "fasts" and "winds" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the enemy team as far as possible not; for that is what the match wins if he tries to break the code twice.
Thus, the encryptor notes and read loudly: “Werfen” for the curves, “Lose” as the opposite to Fest; here, of course, something like “Party” and “Prague” would be possible because he has been careful in the school and knows the window break there.
It goes round for round, team for team.
Although you don’t know the terms of the opposite side, they can better match with any indication that the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too distorted, the replications should be so, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic on "Decrypto" is, unfortunately, the regulator.
Players will probably need to study it quite long and thoroughly until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the network makes it easier.
But whoever starts first will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this untouchable game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as clear as the predecessor and genre primus "Codenames", which also stumbles an agent thematics on a game less words, but for it is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever is just about rates and not victories, he can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows Hitler's grace to police and annoys guests in the cabin
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection of Kulmbach in the night from Saturday to Sunday twice the same.
He first showed Hitler's grace in the Upper City of a passing police staircase, and later he also fell in the Upper City in a cabin when he annoyed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized and did not follow the place reference provided by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In a humble state, he must also be criminal liable for the use of the labels of non-constitutional organizations.
Workplace Pressig was the home of Schubloks
The railway station in Pressig has been the turntable in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When puffers climbed on puffers, you heard it in a very pressing way," Georg Dinkel reminds himself, who archives the history of the place and the station.
This does not encourage anyone.
The brakes were still and the wagons were shattered.
The rail was pure.
Statements that are meaningful for Dinkel's home.
Nothing in the Frankenwald was characterized by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain route to the north, which after a rise of about 220 meters of height has its shield point in Steinbach am Wald.
To deal with this, previously trains and buses were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway operating facility with 21 locks, teaching facility, driving and railway mastery.
"Herzstück was the rotating plate that after a reconstruction in 1899 had a diameter of 18 meters," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a rail historian and 47 years professional railway trainer.
From the Railway Operations (BW) Pressig, which was undertaken in 1968 Bamberg, also were operated locations for the side streets Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - North Halves.
On 15 July 1950, the "People's Journal" a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the 1939 route already minimized the need for trains and buses.
Since 1977, they have only been used for cargo carriers.
By 1991, at least 10,000 wheels were ranked each month.
Parts of the plant were destroyed in 1982 and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that a better use of the site has not been taken into account, including in the point of goods traffic."
Even at Pentecost in 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompless railway festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
“There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here,” Georg Dinkel reminds.
A little later that out.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were deported, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
“The Rangers and Hemmschuhleger performed the hardest work in train traffic,” Dinkel reminds.
Any mistake would have fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen railway station has led to the conversion of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historic and current images are here in the infankenPlus article.
Kerber with starts at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round in the tennis tournament in Beijing, like Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
The victory was 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the number 13 Russians gave up.
The Swabin is now getting it to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
In the framework of the series "Art and Enjoyment" a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach this weekend.
With great facility registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the property Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Rund om Walberla" in the framework of the series "Art and Pleasure".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large audience showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Housewriter Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists for the opening of the Vernissage.
He has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as the main organizer and artist.
Surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good future prospects.
Both have previously actively participated in the selection of the artists and participated in Flyer.
Also this year, on the occasion of Art & Enjoyment, there is again a 70-cent special letter mark designed by them, available at every art station.
There can also be purchased this year’s poster “Betzn austanzen”, designed by Volker Hahn, for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high assumption of the special exhibition.
For the musical turn, Max Marcus Stadler was won from Nuremberg.
When walking through the generous garden, the visitor will quickly realize that the title "Windgame Performance" formally challenges the artistic fantasy and ultimately expresses it playfully.
It is artwork made of metal or ceramic, often equipped with colorful accents.
Already at the entrance of the presence, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "Happy Tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree pump, colored, playfully equipped with 20 wind wheels, 24 hips and 24 alu tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the buschwork in the background, the object appears marvelously shining and invites to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who preferred in three-dimensional letters to dedicate the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in the wind.
On halfway, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy painting made of tone, cement and steel.
The theme "Windgame-Performance" to slider through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate their 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the Albacks also made air to their misfortune.
At least five of them.
They did not want to find themselves partout with the fact that after the dissolution of the Church Chorus "Cäcilia" there should be no more sanges life in the district.
It has now become a legend: On a bank in the bush, they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was greatly celebrated in the "House of Meeting".
“It will be full today,” said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albachtener singers.
In fact, on the anniversary they had resumed the foundation festival.
It was a tradition for years, and then there was a break.
At the time of the 50th anniversary, the tradition festival was back there.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Dream Ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about the series might have had a co-duty in her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chefhostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left for ever.
The series that made her star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013) with whom she was married for ten years.
“It could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues perceived me at the height of the eye,” says Keller in a conversation with the “Image on Sunday”.
At first, she was always the only "wife of Hans von Borsody", but that has changed with the "drumship."
Now the journalists are only calling to Heide Keller.
“If he liked it so well, I don’t know.”
She believes it is possible that her then husband could have been quite jealous, but "as many men feared Hans' conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be the only right one for Hans von Borsody and he wanted not to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I’ve made myself,” as she further explains.
She always had the feeling of “not being good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman that I never really was, even though I sometimes seemed ugly and courageous on the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage with Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could be wrong for a second time."
The day before the state wedding I sat crying in the closet and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody’s marriage also failed.
Why did it never work with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had the love at that time, as it was in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I’ve been too naive to love.”
The Nightfalter, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort Zurich, has wished to attend the ZFF opening party this time.
Our fold is not a motte, but a little lightweight.
And the graceful glow, in which a green carpet is drowned on the six-storey square, blows it over a fee.
But it’s a stop film festival, there more or less famous people want to sun in the light of lightning.
So, this late Thursday evening, he turns over the square to get a short relief in the Aquaclean WC oasis.
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the need facility in the parterre of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to stream a luxurious atmosphere.
This evening, however, in the Lord's Oasis, for any reason, it will fall to heaven.
So go out here, go to the other side of the street: Load guests who have just entertained at the best level in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" celebrate the festival's start with a party in the three-storey shop, like every year.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: It is known that the works shown come from all over the world.
What do you have to do with an article about this festival not all to think about, in order not to fall into scalable advertising for its 190 partner firms.
The filler binds a bandelch around the sensors, which has attached him a good fee, and two bully doors actually wing him generosely in.
Inside the charged go, they dance far after midnight to live music, or they are shown by DJ rhythms, to which they touch each other, and wash down with Cüpli exquisite hips.
In the delicious store in the subterranean, oaths are waiting for sliding mouths, next to the incomparable raw shink Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut off, a chocolate fountain is sprinkled.
And the hammer is: all the sales rails full of exclusive products have not been washed out for the occasion.
This has been so for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it.
The Falter studies the shield at the rolling staircase: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the rolling staircase."
If these are two separate instructions, he’s hidden in the dress code.
But it is rather a conditional construction, and it has already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the top floor, the bird covers a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents himself, does not necessarily receive.
And George Clooney, who has been calling for the brand for years, is not here that evening.
But there, between local prominence, cassent table and kitchen items, a face that becomes known to the observer passes: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor is not far from there.
And really: Just Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixties almost acting like a chorknabe, walks through the crowd.
He is not attacked, he is not attacked, he is mostly distorted.
Specifically for this retardation, pleased to be misunderstood as confusion, international stars love this film festival.

They had - as in stone gardens, as against hole horst - not played badly over wide stages, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we've been completely asleep," the USA coach was angry.
Soon the households led with 8:1, even the early outtime that Bieletzki had taken was not fruitful at first.
"But then suddenly a ruck passed through the team," Bieletzki summarized the second quarter.
For the break, the remainder was only two more doors.
Especially the best of the show, Marius Hintze, met in the phase one-to-one times.
After the change, it became even better from the visitor’s point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst went out at 15:15, then the staff switched almost continuously.
Four minutes before the sirene, the advance was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Attack the unpartials into the event.
Bieletzki usually keeps himself from seeking the guilt from others.
But: The 120-second time penalty, which Steffen Mühlhoff cast, "was a joke."
LIT had laughed well and met four more times until the end - while the desymed ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, backward also against seven men well standing and repeatedly thrown on the empty door.
You can only buy little for compliments.
“Now there has to be a condemned victory,” said the restless serving Bieletzki.
USA doors: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Elon Musk, the founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening call as the chief of the billion-wheeled company.

He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company from the stock exchange and pay $420 per share.
Tesla was estimated at $72 billion.
Musk later returned: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find a foreign chairman, appoint two independent board members, and also set up a committee to monitor Musk’s communication.

46% don’t want Merkel to be chancellor by 2021
After the quarrels of the past few weeks, the GroKo has caught several survey-deep attacks.
The SPD falls back in an AFD survey - Angela Merkel is criticized.
Berlin - The AfD has overcome the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the image on Sunday for the first time across the federation.
In the weekly survey by the Opinion Research Institute, the AfD raises a figure to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point down compared to the previous week and falls at 16 percent.
CDUs and CSUs are also losing a number and are only up to 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union to date in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the votes together.
Thus, the great coalition has now lost the majority in the Sunday issue in all major research institutions – except Allensbach.
The government parties get continuously to 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 parliamentary elections, they received 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, the second strongest party in several surveys, reaches 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reached votes from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is at an average of 10 percent and the FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys, depending on the number of votes, have a uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down.
But also the residence for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has decreased significantly since the 2017 Bundestag elections.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right one in the chancellor's office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS found.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) wishes that the major coalition will continue until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, while 41 percent are for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there were clear popularity claims for Merkel.
The Germans are also considering whether Merkel should again candidate for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are for and 44 percent against.
As a result, 64 per cent of EU supporters want a candidate and 35 per cent don’t.
Aushang at Aldi: Prize Reduced to Love Happiness
Will Aldi be Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in the times of Tinder there are no more romantic dating stories - he should talk with Aldi about potten meat.
Munich - In the times of the digital "Fastfood-Dating" by Tinder and Co. the supermarket as a place of acquaintance for the great love is almost an anachronistic romantic.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced potten meat, boxershort snacks on the wheat table or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a simple swipe to the right.
The app Tinder is in the reputation to be less a contact, but rather a scratch-free stock exchange.
We’ve dared the test: How do women react when they don’t talk long around the hot beard right in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood love potential is when love happiness is predicted by a out-of-eye-lost and-recovered plot.
If the guy then also sign up at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de with his supporters, then it sounds very much for Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and concert - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this advertisement in an unknown Aldi branch to wish that she will also find her dreamman, with whom she has talked briefly about the “30 percent reduced organic butter” meat.
For the belief in the magic of analog knowledge, she deserved her Happy End à la Hollywood.

There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went hard with his in court.
Wordkarg he gave himself, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first moved back (internal) to argue about the lack of performance preparation on the green.
All the story.
It is now running around the fireway.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past game time only had a hard-think over the rise.
I am very pleased with the appearance.
“We made the rooms narrow and pressed the ball.
That could be seen,” Fetsch praised his boys and searched for each individual after the match to simply say “thank” for so much opposition against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerich (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went out of the 4-4-2 almost smoothly over to a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes in front waited on balls.
Wolbeck played a lot more in the first half.
and opportunities.
But Frerich before his exit (17.), the replaced Luca Rehberg (26.) and Jan Schroer (38.) missed the leadership.
Almost that would have happened when the SCA in Minute 41 equally twice in person hit Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbecker Box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his field.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed little.
Schroer also arrived too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes reintroduction.
With the exchange of Miles Geske, Fetsch left again missed a fresh cell cur.
When Old Rhine's Chris Naberbäumer fell on Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect freedom for the square masters 18 meters from the guest house.
The victim came to himself and demonstrated his danger at standards.
Westhues' thing with the right slope hit down to the left from the view of the protector - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes, which should be long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flown in the 80th minute the leather in the penalty room unhappyly to his hand.
Judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately showed the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
For several minutes Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase, before Geske had the winning goal on the pussch in the 87th minute from 12 meters.
It might have been too much of good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Allbright Foundation Report: Women Stay a Rare in Corporate Benefits
Thus, only 8 percent of the chairs were female on the day of the 1st September, as shown in the report “The Power of Monoculture”, which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and presented in advance by the German Press Agency.
“Companies will have to stand differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass through them,” said foundation chief executive Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the UK or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams – with a few exceptions – have long been unthinkable.
The remainder makes the German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented.
It is a different corporate culture.
The low growth of women’s share among the German stock exchange companies is also due only to positive incentives among the companies of the medium-sized value index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
Last year, however, the value was 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the past few years, the female share has stagnated.
Lastly, 26 women worked in the departments.
"I'm sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interests," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would continue to take no commitment to raise the share of "zero percent" so far.
A different image is found in the supervisory councils: on 1 September there was the female share of 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
“If there were equal numbers of women recruited to the board every year, it would have reached 40 percent in 2023,” the report says.

In the collision of the car with a taxi, a 27-year-old passant was deadly injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even to save human lives.
Such a rescue journey took a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of a medical car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was deadly injured.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, the police.
The 46-year-old driver of the notary car had passed a red lamp with a blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then met on a crossroads with the taxi that was driving at Green.
The medical car crashed after the collision against a lamp and a tree.
He found the passant who was still dead at the accident.
Driver of the ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency truck were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be released by the military.
The also seriously injured 29-year-old nurse was able to release herself, but the pedestrian could not help her anymore.
Another specialized physician tried this – but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
Police, in close agreement with the Bonner Prosecutor's Office, are investigating who is guilty of the accident.
Manchester United is losing again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After the blamable out in the Ligacup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3.The way of defeat is still to be discussed.
Significantly the scene was in the 74th minute, in which the replayed Marko Arnautovic scored 3:1 for West Ham; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Since they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester's defense players remained standing, and Arnautovic all the time of the world allowed the ball to pass on the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of previously already over a wide range of inadequate performance.
Currently the United City Rival is Manchester City.
The citizens trained by Mourinho's great rival Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an unrisked 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team for the first time broke the defense ring of the outsiders.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the previous shooter, provided the seventh victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool is no longer table leader.
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri struggled with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
Like in the Cup out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The goal of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained until the final stage of the only goal of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his slider.
After the Reds started with a bad balance in the week, Chelsea was not to be defeated for the second time.
First the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the remis in the league, the Blues Liverpool now also dropped from the table pitch.
Like City, the two London City clubs also celebrated Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal ( against Watford) 2-0 victories.
But the fans of the Gunners, with which Granit Xhaka played, had to suffer against the surprise team from the Hertfordshire county until the 81st minute for a success announcement.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defendant Craig Cathcart unhappyly put Alex Iwobi into his own door, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made his third victim for the decision.
Thanks to the fifth victory in a row, Arsenal passed on Watford and is now right behind the big rival Tottenham on the fifth place A strong impression remains left by ascending Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unsuccessful at 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and reached the 8th place.
VW’s core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show in the sign of diesel debate
The Paris Auto Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic, and yet all present: The diesel scandal and the ring about driving prohibitions and rebuildings should not leave the German automotive companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will show their news from next week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not play any more role.
The possible exchange and rebuilding offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, may still be an important topic at least behind the brilliant scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have among other things their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolstädter is scheduled to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Both were officially presented.
BMW’s iNext is scheduled to start in 2021.
At the heart of Paris is the new 3rd.
Over 250 exhibitors will be present this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to automotive companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in their own halls.
The exhibition, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors arrived.
The severe earthquakes and the subsequent tsunami killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are missing.
More than 500 people were injured.
The island was shocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first beat had the strength of 5.9, the second had the strength of 7.4.
Communications and transport connections have been damaged, there have been enormous material damage.
After the floods, the tsunami broke over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a party.
Fears that the number of victims will continue to rise significantly.
The numbers come only from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne on Sunday with a helper team celebrated the final divine service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The place before the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bicycles was on the programme.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and therefore responsible for the spiritual concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional Motorcycle Divine Service (MoGo) takes place at the House of Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There were about 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to perform a whole other than the usual worship.
At 10 p.m. the bolids were opened in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first the bikers’ breakfast was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even already with a defective curry root.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, also attended.
The preaching was held during the Biker-God Service by Pope Dirk Grzegorek.
For the musical submalture provided the singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
“Al the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill suggests more poetic and quiet sounds,” Francis Schröder said.
This was a novelty in the history of the Motorcycle Divine Service.
Füchtorfer Home Association celebrates great celebration: after the apple comes the milk
And at the day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with fresh prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also interested.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his stunning spectators step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big trichter.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a thinly reduced mass.
Many of the children could not even imagine how to make it a delicious drink.
But they could also see this important step of work in this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered by networks, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stabbed the apple pieces layer for layer that looked a little like hassle.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was no longer so difficult.
The fresh-pressed juice gradually fled into a large vessel.
However, the Füchtorfer farmers had already completed specialties.
So he opened his " Treasure Box" and presented to the older visitors the latest beans.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was equally large.
In a pleasant atmosphere, the parents came to talk, while the children could not only follow the process of apple printing, but they also discovered the built hype for themselves.
Also active of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers engaged in the framework of the festival and invited in some stations for short-term games.
In the coming year, the National Assembly will also offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home house in the heart of the savings will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the topic on hand: in the end it will then go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season plate: "Open situation"
After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 professionals around and spoke courage to them.
A lot of positive was not seen before at 1:4 (0:2) of the table final at Eintracht Frankfurt.
“It’s a disappointing situation, but you have to come out there as a team,” said 96-year-old footballer Pirmin Schwegler and said, “This is, of course, disappointing, because you’re always doing a lot.”
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86) came to follow, stands with two counters all down and are a decline candidate in their current constitution.
Leaded by the overwhelming Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season domestic victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59) and Luka Jovic (89) achieved the gates before 46,300 spectators for the DFB poker winner, who, after the successful general test for the European League match against Lazio Rome, advanced to the midfield of the table with seven points.
Croatian vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hessen at his start-up debut and never got into the hands of Hannover's defense.
The storm that has long been hit after the World Cup showed with his pace and capacity why he is so valuable for the entrance.
In addition to Rebic, the FC Liverpool-leased Brazilian Allan was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurter, which started swingfully.
A headball fake on the tower by Lucas Torró (17th) brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a prospective position in the last minute by the 96-defence around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term falling Kevin Wimmer.
The leadership for the householders fell almost necessarily and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a rejected corner into the penalty room, Haller extended by head before the gate where Ndicka just needed to hold the foot.
It was the first Bundesligatreffer for the defense player arrived this summer from the French second-ligist AJ Auxerre.
Frankfurt was still ahead of the break.
This time, Haller suited his shooter partner Rebic, who was skilled and 96-torwart Michael Esser did not leave a chance.
In the half-time Hannover-Coach Breitenrider responded to the weak imagination of his eleven and brought to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxons were now playing a bit more courageously forward, but burning ideas remained shortly before the end, as the successor still succeeded.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed on De Guzmán, who just had to throw the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was for the Frankfurter against overwhelmed guests only shooting, Jovic also met a minute before the end yet.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Despite the cold temperatures, a good mood was held at the Oktoberfest in the center of the city.
Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter succeeded in the opening of the 185.
Munich Wiesn in the last week with two strikes.
Ghosts: Ghosts Christians Celebrate Holy Cross Feast
The Gentiles Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Feast on September 14 or Sunday afterwards.
The festive divine service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross church with the end blessing.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the shot Christ, who comes from the Thirty-Year-Old War and to whom the legend says a Swedish soldier has been shot.
From the wound flowed blood.
From it developed a great walk to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This has not yet been completed, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, Pope Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The divine ministry was poorly visited despite its importance for the hostage parish.
After the divine service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the end of the blessing ended the church part of the Cross Feast.
For many years, the Catholic Church has then invited to the worldwide part of the festival into the Catholic parish.
The chorm members provided the visitors with heartbreaking meals as well as a large selection of cakes and weather-adjusted farmers.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered guides around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue until next year.
After the equipment has been standing for a while, the damages were more accurately identified and the individual offers were more concrete prepared.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, as the damages already existing a few years ago have become greater, but more has been found, which was only made possible by the inauguration by means of equipment.
The sockel deforestation work has been completed, before the winter the natural stone work has to be started, and we hope that half of these work can be completed this year.
New housing in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Life Aid Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" will be delivered to his destination - there at the inauguration date all the present agreed.
Finally, the so far twelve wheelchair drivers, who have lived in the residence of the life aid Donau-Iller for a long time, are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Larger entrances, flows and doors, larger spaces and barrier-free access to all areas have been considered by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first planning began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was placed on the checkpoint for the inhabitants with Handycap: "The house had come in the years and no longer temporarily in the equipment," Bader explained backward.
In 2016, the Bagger started to destroy the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, the architect said.
Life aid Donau-Iller opens new housing
Approximately 4.6 million euros were invested in life aid.
The Free State taxed 2.4 million euros, the Schwaben district 450000 euros.
The construction work, according to Architect Bader, remained in the planned framework - timely and financially.
He was also grateful to the Director of Life Aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The spaghetti between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-safe structure has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen, with the many provisions, had built a house that would allow the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without the help of others.
The head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: “The house focuses on the special needs of its inhabitants who need aid to be mobile.”
In this case, resilience and functionality have been well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real luck case, because it is no longer to be acquired in the present situation."
In total, the new residence in the Münsterblickstraße offers a space of 1,500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three residential groups.
Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time personnel all employed according to tariffs.
Germany: Differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, Deputy SPD Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all peoples not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germany.
There are differences that pain after almost 30 years of unity.
With these differences we cannot satisfy ourselves," the prime minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the "day level on Sunday."
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that Eastern Germans worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but they earned 15 percent less wages.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after the German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this dirty dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan Jagdhund is expected to slide the wings between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has made it a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan Jagd Dogs.
As Moon's office on Sunday, the two about a year old dogs reached their recipients on Thursday.
They then passed the border area of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to facilitate the “advantage” to the animals.
Dogs with the thick white fell, thin ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
It is a national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The gift of friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
The two countries also agreed to jointly participate in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and jointly apply for the 2032 Olympics.
In the context of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile missiles.
Austria's history moves in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which is celebrated in this memorial year for almost ten months, numerous new books have appeared, mostly answering this question in the reflection of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archive, says this in the magnificent "picture book" of Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to the actual work – this is the informal motto for the Great Coalition’s working week that begins today.
Not a interview, not a speech, in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and even from the CSU have not ultimately sworn the “return to work” mantrafully.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cassiers and otherwise employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what actually is the difference between work and practical work, but it is right.
If the federal government is now enough to devote itself again to its task – to govern – it should now not be stopped with conceptual debates about it.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blames of the last weeks, will probably be revealed on Monday.
On the evening, the leaders of the government parties gather to the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to regularly call this round to resolve conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
However, in the first place, conflicting issues are on the agenda with the diesel equipment and the Employee Immigration Act.
CSU Traffic Minister Scheuer wants to make the automotive companies with exchange awards glimpse away, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the duty to technical re-equipment of older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has reached an approximation over the weekend, the Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned law on workers’ immigration.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or take a training.
The Union is strictly against the “track shift” from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be again disputes among the coalition partners – and how should it be different?
Not Equal and Equal have joined together to GroKo, but three partners with very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without controversy, a society characterized by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not advance.
But in order to be constructive, the dispute should not be brought up again for partial reasons on the question of being or not being.
It is about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD are to struggle, but always keep in mind the reality of the people.
What is useful and useful to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the trace change question can be cleared pragmatically – and thus gain confidence back.
This is why the People’s Party has to fight.
Pilz revises working hours at Hartinger
Minister in Vision
Does the Ministry of Labour violate the applicable law?
Daniela Holzinger is looking forward to this.
"Really day and night" their lawmakers had worked on the social security reform, a overwhelming social minister in the presentation of selfie two weeks ago.
At List-Pilz candidate Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprised - she is now bringing the matter to parliament by request.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the involvement of her team and in no way to declare violations of the applicable law of service before the current cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions to get Hartinger "free from any suspicion."
Police are searching for women's legs
Marx Green - For a long time the police did not talk about it.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is buried.
The route is closed in the Marx Green area until Monday.
It was predicted that the researchers had previously used an archaeological dog.
The dog, which was specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide in the multi-time operation could eventually limit the relevant place to a few meters.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Supreme Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, a ground anomaly was discovered in the area of the said road piece.
For more than a year, the Prosecutor’s Office and the Criminal Police Court have been investigating the missing case.
More and more times a wheelchair was blocked at Marx Green and investigated with sonar equipment because the investigators suspect that this could have been shrinked by Heike's body 30 years ago during the state road's rebuilding.
Colour powder and eggs: crawl in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia takes place for the first time.
But it comes to crawl earlier.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of the autumn of 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, conflicts between separatists and police occurred in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence defenders, among other things, with colour powder, as they wanted to prevent them from getting closer to a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Approximately 3,000 police officers of Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted a protest to honour their colleagues who were employed in the electoral premises during the illegal referendum last year.
In the attempt to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at that time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to separate the demonstrations of separatists and the central state security forces, Spanish media.
But some of the about 6,000 separatists had then tried by force to break the police chain, and the officials, among other things, appelled with colours and eggs.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, the authorities said.
The independence referendum is held for the first time on Monday.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to divide the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had put Catalonia under forced administration in the autumn of 2017.
The former regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
However, several ministers of the then regional government and other separatist activists continue to sit in prison.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the arrival of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra stands on the “right to self-determination” of the Catalan.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathered Unconsciousness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen Separate Untold
The red-white horns continue to take place.
At FC Gütersloh, it was only enough to score 0-0.
The final light and the third last revealed them before 438 spectators in the Heidewald stadium as a gathered insight.
The first half was angry by the entertainment factor.
Whoever wanted to buy a beer or a beef, could do this without worry.
There was no danger of missing a torchance because there was practically no one.
First shot after half an hour.
For the first (harmless) break of the entire match, Goodslohs Nick Flock was responsible in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle also the only real - chance had the Ahlens, as Cihan Yilmaz FCG Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty room limit.
The hosts were harmless.
Their most effective action consisted in a early change.
Stormer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the shift, both teams decided to do something against the increasing tiredness.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters targeted just over the housing and after an hour, the goods loers also appeared offensive for the first time.
After a ballet defeat by Matthäus Wieckowicz it went fixed.
The rapidly presented contour over Sinan Aygün "coronated" Nick Flock (62) with a but lacking shot in the arms of RWA-torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they followed with a headball from Wieckowicz (66), after an eckball from the former allier Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It did – nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahlens did not exist.
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but the one also brought nothing in.
Angelo Daut then tried to get the positive out: "I like we played at zero."
“We were not as dangerful this time as we were against woodwicks and that although our opponent had no desire to play here,” said RW Ahlens Interimstrainer.
Offensive "plots everything so a little" against a team, "who just wanted to defend.
I didn’t feel like we could get an opponent,” Daut said.
As a spectator, he didn’t feel like his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too dull for that.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Fortunately there are enough creams
This pleases Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Exhibition Station, for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assured: “These donations remain in Reckenfeld.”
At opening, the sky appeared radiant blue, but the space was still slightly empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
For: "Here it's so beautiful, so we're here today," said a visitor.
The festival organizer Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with an ordinary prize of humor.
For the spouse Brockmann, who should actually be weighted against food, in the short term Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer go in.
Verena (the daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there are enough creams.
And the "representation" did not take it, inter alia, to musically entertain the increasingly growing visitors.
This was so good that a few people's songs were heard later.
“It’s great,” Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many activities with their stands, including mostly associations.
"In fact, there shouldn't be anything like a table at all," he thanked himself for the action of the men's chore.
Andreas Hajek praised the engagement of all those who were involved in the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the “Clean up” action.
Our garden city gives itself a colourful stretch - here is what goes.
Then the maikranz of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was removed with the help of the firefighters and brought to the Winter Quarter.
In many stages was worked for the physical good.
From sweet to sweet it was all.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, has become creative on his decorations.
Furnierwork, beer cover with reck fields of motives and a lot more he had in offer.
One speciality offered three reck fields of inkers: "reck fields of honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-bushchlitters.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, so good the cake smelled.
The sociality is that the visitors then stayed long until the evening hours, even without the stage program that there is no at the autumn party.
Smiling with local police message: No successful advertising for skateboarding facilities
In Lengerich, unknown people have hardly contributed to the construction of a skateboard.
In several places there are corresponding shifts, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
At least in one case, the police have been sentenced for damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" appear on the paintings, among other things, at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the professional election exhibition on September 19, a corresponding letter was discovered on the advertising display at the climbing to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message at that time was apparently "only" left with an edging, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, it stood there again, this time it was overwhelmed," Rottmann said.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising display must be replaced.
A special note is given in this case by the fact that on the table are also named several large companies from Lengerich.
If the skate facility is built, its realization will also be enabled by sponsors.
Promises are already there, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the city department of school, sport and culture, without name.
It is very possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies standing on the scratched table.
For years, local policy and administration have been dealing with the subject of skateboarding.
After the old was destroyed at the LWL clinic, after a while, the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the council voted for the fire station.
However, this proposal was not implemented - too many factors seemed to speak against a construction in this place.
At the end of June there was a turnover.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word is by the City Council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that it could be built with a positive vote in 2019.
Flight safety is getting worse.
After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, the German airlines do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
“This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes,” said the head of the air security trade union, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the air transport summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known need for staff in the European air security, for which there is no quick solution.
“Airlines and airports can rapid improvements for the next year, but the training of new lotteries will take four to five years,” he said.
In Europe, the market for ready-trained lottery is empty.
Only in the center of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas once again criticized that various air traffic trade unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the Federation, the countries, the air security, the airlines and the airports meet in the city of Hansestad to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional working intensity and overtime, that will not go without us," said the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German Air Security.
Maas once again made the EU Commission’s provisions responsible for the Lotsen missions.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period until 2019 were too low.
The costs and personnel savings resulting from this are now fully related to the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to take action in Brussels for arrangements that “do not shrink the air further to the air security.”
Currently, the EU regulations would be agreed by 2024 and there are concerns about further aggravations.
The EU is constantly exposed to lobbying pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now collecting exactly what they have seated themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs in the airlines will lead to a reflection.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Aviation Security (DFS) offers a “voting training and future pact,” Maas said.
The previously announced admission of 120 lottery students per year over the next five years is sufficient to balance the age-related discharges.
The necessary staff building is not associated with this.

Barcelona: Violence during the demonstrations of police and Catalan independence defenders.
During two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence defenders in Barcelona, there have been violent confrontations with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 independence defenders demonstrated.
The Catalan police attempted to keep the two protests away from each other.
According to the operations, however, independence defenders repeatedly attempted to break the security blockade.
They had attacked the officers with colour and shots.
According to the news, there were also disputes between the participants of the various protests.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrestations.
Better wages and honour of colleagues
The police wanted to honour the colleagues who stood almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
They also demand better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters felt it as a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona.
“Why did they come here to protest?” said the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator, Manel Perez, to AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they’ve cracked us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic, who wanted to mention his name only with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
“Naturally, we want to support our comrades who did their only duty last year: to defend the law,” he said.
But the demonstration is there to uphold our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues were "not coming to provoke," the police said.

Football: Juve coach praises after top match: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star shooter "has played the best match this evening along with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champion's 3:1 (1:1) victory against the SSC Napoli.
For the coach, the expensive star, even without his own door, was the decisive man in the important match against the traitor.
“Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it’s doing well,” Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game after the early rescue by the goal of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hunted the worst follower so far.
The goalkeeper supported by Real Madrid first set up the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26./49).
And after a corner by headball Ronaldo also performed the preparation for the hit of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76) who just had to push in short before the goal line.
“He gives a lot of patterns,” the coach praised.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record-threater in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
“We need to be even better in serving him,” the coach asked.
The best juve shelter is currently Mandzukic with four matches - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With Ronaldo's purchase for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' overpower seems to become even more oppressive.
Seven victories in seven games are the unmatched series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the last seven years has already six counting advances over Napoli.
The table range trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti was not unlikely against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58), the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to leave the square after a too hard defeat against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Napoli," Turin coach commented.
It also feels like Emre Can.
The German national player took over at Juve.
The professional from FC Liverpool was involved in all seven league parties.
The midfield player also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown out of the place at the 2:0 victory of the tourners and is blocked for the home match on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West Changes His Name
With a scurling performance, Rapper Kanye West attracted attention at the U.S. TV show "Saturday Night Live" this weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided pearls and query signs among the viewers.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change timely for the release of his new album.
I would like to call him “Yes,” the musician said.
"The Being that was known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the deceased singer Prince, when he gave his artist name.
The pseudonym is not a news.
The 10th album appeared under this name.
In an interview with KRRL, the artist had explained that “Ye” has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means ‘you’,” the rapper said.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
made by!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage did not make any heal from his disappointment.
It was a weak game today.
The opponent was simply more aggressive, we’ve put him as much as never before problems.” accordingly thin read the list of Hoetmarer invasion possibilities.
Give two tournaments in 90 minutes, so you can rarely make games positive.
Football Circuit League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first passage, but the first used Maik Krause from the top angle to the early leadership (7.).
In the 43th minute, Steffen would have been able to raise Uphus, but after Krause's great preparation, he was freely standing.
The hosts only had a double chance when Moritz Höne first failed at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the search Jan Blome also found his master in the Keeper broadcast.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61) and Heinz Linnemann (69) gave them all.
One handheld meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the gate line and looked red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide pushed the ball over the line, the match was determined (81.).
"We had hard criticized each other before, that was different today than in the past weeks," Florian Kraus said.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.)

Football: Kreisliga A2 Munster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to think about it,” he said.
“We don’t have any access to it,” he allegedly meant the wing band with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-white people who offend collectively.
He was still able to laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, swinged crazy and pulled from then His players was the relief to notice that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well noticed, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays the championship and the other, Albersloh, struggles for the class retention.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
“This was our best season performance with distance,” he says.
"The way we come back after 0:2 and we're standing against one of the top teams in the league throughout the game, it's really phenomenal."
The worse it seems that you have to go home with empty hands.
Top Torjäger Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season offer (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 he placed over the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but such a player can’t be taken out completely.
“It was madness what he did,” Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the side shift, his own eleven man achieved the balance: McGill's freedom shipped from the left between Hövelmann and Concordia's Torhüter Hinkerohe through into the long Toreck (45.).
After the side shift it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
After that it went and went.
It was a crazy, action-loaded game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64) and only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann left (69).
Despite the surplus, Albersloh was unable to compete the last Concordia score (80) again.
We have to focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
“The game against the creatures, that’s what we have to win now,” Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87 Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87 Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).

Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
Good that he’s gone again.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Famous Guests and New Offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing will offer approximately 80 meetings by the middle of the next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he personally wants to recover the tolerance price in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff the term was too short: as Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was a guest there.
The Academy Director, Udo Hahn, said that “all federal presidents and federal chancellors were already with us” and that the Academy in the Castle of Tutzing repeatedly appears famous, but it was also a topic in the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, singer Konstantin Wecker takes part in a meeting on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, and on September 29, writer Frido Mann takes part in a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has promised that he will personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category will also be received by television moderator Dunja Hayali (we).
The approximately 80 meetings by the middle of 2019 have it in itself.
“The pension is not safe!” is stated in a meeting title.
"SOS at the borders of Europe" - so the Academy describes the "riskful and deadly route over the Mediterranean."
“And to a meeting on Syria: “Barbarei without limit.”
Arms defeat, destruction, torture, death – the war defeats every human idea.”
From structural racism in society to the gap between poor and rich to the radical change of work through digitalization, the spectrum reaches.
Hahn, director of the Academy, said: “A free democracy needs places where a civil society can gather to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions.”

Karl Marx’s birthday soon awaits more visitors of the direction of capitalism criticism, the others rather a tendency “from the left to the middle”.
What about neutrality?
“We are a 100% daughter of the Evangelical Country Church,” said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, “so we are not 100% neutral.”
Music Baret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Advanced for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the Hall of the Christian Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaretist, Teubner predicted gender understanding, not only with humor and heart heat for the (sensed) woman and the (sensed) man and what else might be, but also with music.
The mini guitar put her in and also mastered her violin.
On the wing was Ben Süverkrüp.
He is, on the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to word even until the end of the sentence, on the other hand, a true pianist: So congenial harmoniously accompanied supercrypt teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
That was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, namely as it suited to the night's red thread.
Thus, Teubner had brought into play a paradox: the satisfaction comes to the man, if he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner does not benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates itself: What would have arisen from Mozart’s composition, if the “Nannerl” had hopelessly opened the door?
So surcroop slides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" to the "Lied of Death", and from Mozart's g-Moll symphony to a playful dancing.
There was a great applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers were delivered by Karlheinz Kleintje, treasure master of the association, the Chansonette.
However, Chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not accept an additional thanks.
She had the idea to give the duo, in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, one in Wolbeck.

Handball: Damen-Landesliga: Ahlener SG retains the White West against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlene women had trouble especially with the third-liga player Carolin Stallmann, who alone scored ten goals.
“I was really happy with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn’t get them in hand,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was worried more about the many missed opportunities.
The concentration at the end left his team missing this time.
As a result, the ASG rushed almost to the end with a rest, leaving for a break at 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.) back.
Until the end, the larger bank of the hosts became decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put back room Merle Klement on the left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive doors" (Aydogdu).

Volleyball: 3rd Women’s League: Top of the BSV East Bevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volley-ballers of the BSV East Bevern have established themselves again in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At the second league departure VC Allbau Essen, the Blue-White won by 3:1.
“It was a big step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
We’ve prepared it now,” coach Dominik Münch rejoiced after a untouched performance of his team at the defeated table leader.
The first passage dominated the guests almost according to their desire.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the ex-master of the previous year at 25:15.
Food was accepted in the two-wheel, but did not come into the game.
We engaged them well.
Our opponent has hit with high risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV led already with 12:8. "Food has changed the acceptance to a triangle.
We couldn’t keep the pressure.
The food has risen, and we’ve gotten a little bit off,” Munch continued.
At 18:17 for the first time the volley-ballers from the Ruhr region had their nose ahead.
Although the East Beverne at 19:24 left four set balls, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," the coach was at an upward level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV's turn of the leaf in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Munch: “We played there consistently and calmly.”
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-white passed four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also taken a pleasant day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: the opening of the mosque as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne was introduced by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
“The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left in the German-Turkish relationship a shrimp that can only be hardly gathered together,” said TGD chairman Gökay Sofuoglu, to Germany’s editorial network.
Both the Turkish and German sides had missed the chance of a joint, reconciling appearance.
"Instead of side by side with German top politicians to emphasize the membership of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the term for his purposes," Sofuoglu said.
The extensive exclusion of the German public has strengthened “a lot of reservations.”
Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After a long summer break, it’s finally time again.
On October 18th (Tuesday) at 19.30 p.m. the Nottuln home association already hosts its fifth Nottulner follow-up meeting in the Camino Room of the Old Office.
Almost on the day exactly it was a year ago that we held a result meeting for the first time.
Meanwhile, this event has become a fixed part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln,” said Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I't have thought that our outcome meeting would be so fast in Nottuln.
Whether it was a storm of Friederike in January or a heat storm in July, the cabin room of the office was always full occupied.
“The program at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colorful mix of German folk, walker and seemanns songs, folk songs, evergreens and old strikes,” says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friendly musicians to Nottuln.
On the first meeting, Klaus Spellmeyer promised his birthday with his accordeon.
He has been a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt, playing music with plattdeutsche Texte.
Now he is on the way with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folktreff remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" enthusiasmed the listeners and sent home with an earworm.

From pure vegetation to ecology
With a gala in Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125th anniversary of the Circular Association for Gardening and Land Care was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus the last foundation impulses were placed for the Circular Association for Gardening and Land Care in Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher City Hall.
In fact, he was called different at that time: as "Kulmbach City and Land" he was raised from the baptism by mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit association also differs from today’s work – it was actually about fruit cultivation, about flowers and gardening no one thought at that time.
“At that time, in the Age of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites,” Circle Healer Günter Dippold said in his solemn speech.
Fruit trees should be planted on distant streets, in schools so-called industrial gardens were built.
The Obstanbau is still the task of the 55 garden buildings in the district of Kulmbach, which comprises 7,000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A natural gardening, biological plant protection, village decoration and nutrition play an equally important role as the mediation of knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
How versatile the tasks of a garden building association are, the members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Maulwürfe" showed fun on the stage.
“Youth work is especially urgent in the digital age,” said Circle Chairman Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm emphasized how important experiences in nature are for life.
The castan collection was a huge deal for us children, I doubt that you can gather a lot of pleasure with smartphone & Co. similarly.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with council Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are to stand, the Circle Association decides," Landrat Söllner added, highlighting the special importance of garden building for the villages.
The circle association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
That this is a real concern of the many garden buildings in the countryside, the district manager and expert consultant Friedhelm Haun also left no doubt.
He led the many visitors with an image lecture through the long history of the circular union and, among other things, the need for self-care after the war.
Previously, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was moisturized.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden has turned into a cottage and residential garden.
“Nature has existed, it was already there before us and we have to orient on it,” said the expert in fruit and nuts trees.
Therefore, the garden builders are encouraged not to leave down so that our home will remain beautiful and worthy of life.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, the President of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl, added.
“We have to stop the eklatant decline in insects, that’s what we’re guilty of our children and grandchildren,” Günter Reif concluded the successful fest act, which was celebrated by the turmbläsers of the Thurnau music association.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister to move UN meeting
The Mexican government wants clarity on Nafta: they put the two trade partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada’s Foreign Minister now gives the trade agreement an absolute priority – and delays her speech before the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in the ring for a renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Meeting in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, she will speak before the United Nations General Assembly only on Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
Meanwhile, it focuses on the renewal of NAFTA.
Mexican economic minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada and the U.S. negotiating leaders will have 48 hours of time to agree if Canada actually wishes to join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the U.S.
In August, the United States and Mexico agreed to renew the regional free trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump said Canada could be excluded from oil in the future.
The talks about a renewal have been ongoing for more than a year.
The agreement is expected to be concluded until Sunday evening (local time), and Trump's government wants to submit the agreement to the U.S. Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure in negotiations, Mexican President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday to pursue a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Bolsonaro's presidential candidate
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro has left the hospital.
The extreme right-wing ex-militar wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his resignation, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will take public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential election.
The politician was attacked on the open street in early September during a campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went on the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele non" (in German: "The not") women's associations had called for protests against the former military.
Also on social networks, the associations against Bolsonaro made racist and feminist statements mobile.
Thousands of protesters were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital of Brazil, the protests mixed with a protest of the Brazilian Labour Party (PT) candidate, Fernando Haddad.
He was replaced by former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and therefore is not allowed to candidate.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As the former mayor of the million city of São Paulo, Haddad was far behind the extreme right-wing candidate Bolsonaro.
The “Trump of Brazil” has long been involved in political activity, but recently presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If no one of the candidates reaches the absolute majority in the first round of the election, there will be a vote on 28 October.
Observators predict that Bolsonaro will not be successful out of this - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for his struggle against homosexuals and black men, and heed the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He is constantly shocked by verbal discrepancies.
Another time he said the supporters of Lula’s left-wing Labour Party should be shot dead.

After a long illness, Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsens website.
At the death bed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.

“Here we stand, take the bones and burn a concert table with the power of a tiger.” Only the band names of “Here We Stand”, “Tiger Bonesaw” and “The Ignition” put such a re-description of the rock live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the city center shoe factory near: Hardrock pure of three fellow-friendly bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert start, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area – all in conjunction with the booking agency “Mosquito” from Oelde – with their bands soundly inspire the around 120 visitors of the “Mint Mosquito” rock night.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika is also able to convince the start of the concert with the latest, unknown pieces from his own foot and the soon appearance of the CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced at the appearance for a sound and impressive interaction.
Although the calls for “to give” are not to be heard, “Tiger Bonesaw” then leaves the stage to the trio “Here We Stand”.
That hard rock is not the same hard rock, the guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich am Bass and the battalionist Kai Hölscher demonstrate with their alternatives, sometimes on the classic rock of the 1970s reminding sounds.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", in "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock there is also a synthesizer to be used.
Not only is the desirable, just balladious "Take Me Home" glorified by the shift of melodic passages to the guitar-related rock ribs of the multi-screen songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishhuschen has, however, played a special degree of popularity since its founding in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present its hardrock on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" has a special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 China Tour - is obvious and uninterruptible.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also puts his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
To the sound that feels even higher than before, the guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a transformed solo, running through the audience.
A certain noise is, of course, due to such hardrock concerts: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, the mixer's team said, at the three concerts of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of the press air hammer, but it is still clearly under the directions of the "Wacken-Fesitvals", indicating the "The Ignition" on their website.
120 decibels in dust power as is usual in the annual metal standing in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlene audience does not need this rock night.
After just four hours, the three bands of the harder rock gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.
“Here we stand, took the bone marrow and burned a concert table with the power of a tiger,” all three groups, of course in the transmitted sense, can say in the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

Trump tells Kim, “And then we fell in love”
The fact that North Korean President Kim is well-known despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
Now, Trump has made a true love declaration to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the age of 72, the married US president announced a new flame.
The tragic: It is a remote relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump has found almost a crazy word for the half-old explosion of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although it appears to be quite broken in the ring around North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
“I was crazy, he too, and between us it went and went,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay ?
Not really.
And not only the conversations with Kim had brought his heart to a mixture.
He wrote great letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also brought political fruits: Trump pointed to the Kim’s announced stop of all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have so far seen little more than lips confessions.
That the enthusiasm for whether his martial threats famous "Rocket Man" - according to Trump's headline for Kim - should not be remembered by everyone, the US president seemed to be quite aware.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of it at his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: “Donald Trump says they’ve fallen in love.”
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unprecedented.
But he was very little concerned about it, Trump explained and then directed his finger to the crowd: “I’ve always told you that it’s so easy to be president.”
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there to push into this prall-filled arena, but we would have only 200 people out there.
Octoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler bestly visited, soundfully as well as above-mentioned saturated with sun: Very varied and with a good shoot Octoberfestflair, Baesweiler's centre has shut out on Sunday.

Refugees rescued from Libyan prison video
Nigerian refugees, using a mobile video, have warned of their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya, allowing them to be rescued.
The group had drawn the recording in their cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July under life danger and spread it online.
“They refuse to send us back,” a man said in a video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website France 24 Observers, whose editors warned the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees flew to Nigeria at the end of August.
“Without the video we’t have been able to return to Nigeria,” Efe Onyeka, who had taken the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach Europe through the Mediterranean Sea.
With the video, he said he was in danger.
One of his counterparts has been slaughtered by the guardians almost to death, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of imprisonment were catastrophic: "They hit us all with pipe and stools."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the Latrine.
The IOM is organizing the voluntary return of refugees who have been displaced in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been returned to their homeland this year through the program, IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo, said.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not extraordinary in light of the poor detention conditions in Libya.
He has not heard of a phone call by video yet.
International organizations have long criticized the situation in Libya’s refugee camps as unhuman.
The north African state, which is dominated by large portions of militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

At 16:50 the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front house of the 1st floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then through the roof terrace and from there through a staircase to the ground floor or the front place.

Laschet calls for rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) in a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own statements, agreed on the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries are currently “exaggerated,” Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at the Cologne Airport.
This affects mainly arrest waves, the freedom of the press and the freedom of religion.
He has therefore made clear to Erdogan that if the relations are to normalize in the future, if the economic relations are to be deepen, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.”
Laschet also spoke of the cases of Germans sitting in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of speech will be respected.
Erdogan has reiterated the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was shortly moved to a building of the Federal Defence Ministry’s air preparation at the Cologne Airport.
Originally it was intended to take place at the Castle of Wahn, but the castle owners had rejected it for political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to open the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, “The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are also their counterparts – and not the Turkish president.
Failure to trust the United States: North Korea demands disarmament
While U.S. President Trump will not be tired of emphasizing the successes in the negotiations on North Korea's denuclearization, the East Asian regime represents the situation more smooth.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a visit to Washington.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations on a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons with its ongoing sanctions.
“The latest stop comes because the U.S. is building on compulsory measures that are fatal to trust,” Ri said in a statement.
A disarmament is unimaginable for North Korea under these circumstances.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves,” he said.
The fact that North Korea’s sanctions could “pull on the knees” is “a dream of people who don’t know us.”
To build confidence, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test plant.
However, there were no "responsive reactions" from the US side, the minister criticized.
As a result of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council alone last year decided three sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have called for strict compliance with the criminal measures in the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump first met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the U.S. President is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will return to Pyongyang for talks on the end of North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the House of the Open Door HoT got nothing with: white roofs and flowers jewelry on the tables and a great buffet waited for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
Admired the youth of the HoT had the buffet with flavours from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was funded by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
The start with the new facility was not just easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, the bad surprise came: an electricity failure had disabled the huge, two-party refrigerator, the food was stumbled and had to be dissolved.
"Now we had to start again from the forefront: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and youth wanted to do it alone," Westbuer said.
And so they all packed.
The result was visible, the guests were excited.
“Better cook can’t do it either,” a visitor praised impressed while Hokkaido curb soup was served or guests were allowed to serve for quiche, liver cakes or cakes.
“It’s really great what the children and youth have put on their legs,” said Pope Frank Beckmann, while Wizard Stephan Lammen made surprises with cartridges and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW Board of the Table
From frustration over criticism from his own rows, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has given up his positions in the Landesverband.
Sartor became famous throughout the country because the Essener Table had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He has already resigned as the Vice-Chief of the NRW Talks in July, Sartor told "World on Sunday".
I have fallen too many in my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding to the DPA for the decision of his long-term deputy representative.
The criticism was brought by Sartor.
“I can understand his step – there were people who didn’t know exactly why the Eaten Table did that.”
Sartor, however, is still active for the Eaten Table - "six days a week, there's nothing changing," Weilerswist said.
Sartor criticized in the "World on Sunday" again criticism of colleagues from other tables.
One should not follow the approach, "Without us the people in the city are hungry."
It is the duty of the state to ensure that people do not die of hunger.
At a table congress on Friday in Berlin the Essener did not attend.
“There’s too much sweet smell to me,” he said.
There are all these social fuses that criticized me so.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly a year after the marriage for all came into force, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two took the Jawort on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership was not questioned for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
“If we marry, then right.” he has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a household policy spokesman for the SPD-Bundestag fraction and one of the spokesman for the Seeheimer Circle, the conservative SPD flagship.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs was raised with a speech on June 30, 2017.
So he had accused Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stopped" on the issue.
“This was your Schabowski moment,” he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, gay couples can marry just like heterosexual couples.
Earlier, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters of heck cut
There was a lot of work before the members of the Citizen Association of Children's House and the Society for Leprakunde.
For about 400 meters of heck around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
“We do this to reduce the costs,” citizens’ association chairman Walter Schröer said.
And so much has been gathered.
Because of the hot summer, we’re late this time, but fortunately it’s just a shape.
In the spring, the heck has already been cut.
The breakfast always following the work has a long tradition.
“It should also be everyone with the strength,” Walter Schröer said.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner gets gold at the Kanuslalom World Cup
Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Kanuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed the Olympic bronze for three hundred seconds.
I was well prepared, I had enough trips here at the facility and it’s all suited today,” the Olympia Third of London said in 2012.
In the goal, he threw his paddle away from joy and drove both arms safely to the height – knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had the start number 4.
However, the remaining six starters were unable to overcome their fabel time of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pawel Eigel.

Hertha plays: from the reality: Bayern against Ajax demands
The prejudice is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bayern to "do not like".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim phase for Niko Kovac's term.
The first small performance part under the new coach Niko Kovac will not rise to the larger autumn depth for the Munich.
A week ago, we had the impression that we are unbeatable.
Now we’ve got a bit of reality,” said Thomas Müller after the winning 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a response for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us knows that this really annoys us and we will give gas on Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year outside no own goal shot, as at the same time of the pre-season two compulsory games in series without victory, the table leadership in the football Bundesliga now lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation has long not been as dramatic as the end phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg in the 1:1 with its running man-to-man-taktic and the Berliners through their playful needle stick over the outside have delivered within three days equally two blue pounds, as the last seemingly overpowerful Bayern are still to break.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we'll do everything we can to make us successful again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, he went with his losers in his native town surprisingly gentle and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the again poor deal with opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would, however, make the first interim phase of his term positive before the national match break - otherwise the sound might sharpen.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second royal-class appearance this season after 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round against Ajax begins, which at the start AEK Athens had also defeated sovereignly by 3-0.
“Now we’ve gotten in two matches, but we’ll make our goals again,” national team captain Manuel Neuer said.
As already after the lost Pokal final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich clearly spoke.
The advocate appeared in the role as a reminder.
"I don't think that's all luck, we have to re-work it because we don't make the many opportunities and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old said shortly before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh game day of the previous game, the Bayern were even with five counters behind Dortmund, which now has taken the top again with a point of advance.
And so Kimmich, with an eyewinker, at least appreciated positively that now the public debate about the allegedly unbeatable Bayern has ended.
“Yes, that’s good,” the national player said.
It’s good for the league.
DFB boss in shooting line: Özil-Causa: Erdogan's sharp attack on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan claims the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan to Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the federation line.
Now a new post is to be created.
On different scenes, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel struggled for the highness in the long-term issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticized the deal with the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the Great Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB head defended the association line.
Early Sunday morning, the Grindel personally sharply attacked by Özil in the Mainzer ZDF's "Sportstudio" announced the consequences of the cause.
“In the future, because we also have a lot of players with migration background in the sub-team, we will have to draw very accurate conclusions that this is not repeated,” the 57-year-old said and wants to win a national player without migration background as another integration commissioner.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan is not for the values of football and the DFB.
He had with sharp words attacked racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our in Germany born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They have removed them from this society because they were allowed to photograph with me in England,” Erdogan said on Saturday in the town.
To be honest, as their president, I couldn’t deny that our two young men, who have risen up to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that he, unlike Özil after the world championship case that the two took their start by photos with Erdogan, felt "reasonably treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced he wants to face the players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I’m a German, if I lose, I’m a migrant – that’s not possible.
“I am very sorry that he has such an impression,” Grindel said.
We had to defend Mesut more, I’ve always said that.
But he does not see any reason for Özils' return to the national team.
As a consequence, next to the born Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration commissioner will be called.
“If there is a person without a migratory background that makes a significant influence on society and football and says, ‘The topic is important, we have to take care of it,’ that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our teams in the place where integration needs to work,” Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup out and the Özil case, he wants to re-candidate for the office as DFB president next year.
“I’m doing my job and I’m trying to make it as good as I can,” Grindel said.
A year old man builds three accidents within three hours

Moorbrand in Meppen: Nearly 1,000 operators are still in operation.
Approximately four weeks after the moorbrand exploded on a federal defence area in Emsland, 980 operating forces are still engaged in the dismantling work.
This was by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to be stable, a spokesman said that 70 volunteers have been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it is said.
In the night of Sunday, a superficial fire was discovered and deleted.
Last week the catastrophe was repealed, which was called about a week earlier on 21 September, because it was feared that the flames by wind and radial flight would threaten neighboring forests and settlements.
On Thursday, it was said that a fire attack on neighboring communities no longer threatens.
From time to time, more than 1,500 officers at the site tried to get the large fire under control.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehrtestgelände near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also information flights with the Bundeswehr drones.
For the 2nd and 5th of October, according to the Bundeswehr, information flights with "Tornados" are planned again.
The fire was triggered by test missiles launched by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand was temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometers over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr will set up a contact point that will respond to damages.
First claims for damages have already been announced by hotels and holiday houses owners.

In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs was raised with a speech on June 30, 2017.
So he had accused Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stopped" on the issue.
“This was your Schabowski moment,” he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, gay couples can marry just like heterosexual couples.
Earlier, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Referendum on new names in Macedonia
In Macedonia, the thrilled referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
About 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their country will be named North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of neighboring Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens has for almost three decades blocked any approach of Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote yes, they also give the start shot for the Western integration of their country.

Switzerland Launches Electronic Register for Organ Donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve family members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be taken with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is aimed at facilitating organ donations and relieving family members in stressful situations.
People who want to provide their organs in the event of death can be registered there.
Your wishes are then received in case of need by Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs will continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
It is estimated that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donation card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But in only five percent of cases, a card is found at the critical moment at possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of conversations, relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
“They then have to decide representatively in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdening,” says Always.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information about possible organ donations on the medical card, as said the spokeswoman of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert.
“There’s no register in which people can record their wishes – pro or against organ donations –,” she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn has voted for a new organ donation regulation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be regarded as an organ donor unless he or his relatives object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student becomes world champion
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in headset.
In the weekend in Wolfsburg he played against 39 counterparts.
This was by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, where the competition was hosted, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as chief judge Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes the competition every two years.
For example, previous tasks were: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since viewers were not permitted, a show was held on Saturday afternoon, where participants played against guests from the audience with pocket computers.
Wenzel Hello from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when he counts.
He is one of seven in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
He had been there two years ago when he was 14 years old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or miracle child, organizers can start little.
“Happiness can be trained,” he said.
Many participants exercised several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even stages-oriented computing competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, the square roots of six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprising tasks, for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here the Germans will also have good chances, the chief judge said.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because there, in early childhood, headaches are taught more intensely and with other, effective methods.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
The federal government plans a clear extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-Blue Coalition will send a relevant draft law on the so-called "Symbol-Law" in review.
This will significantly extend the number of terrorist or similar groups captured by the ban.
Polar cold air brings snow to the mountains in the West
Mrs. Holle will blow out her beds for the next week in the West for the first time: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week decreases to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it could fall down at a strong intensity of about 1,000 meters, it said.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohen Tauern is above 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 centimeters of new snow.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore winter.
Farmers May Start Annual Kick Care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein farmers are allowed to start their annual knick care on Monday.
The unique “green valleys” in Germany have been shaping the landscape of the wildland for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide trees and stains are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last rescue spaces.
Knicks connect as corridors dispersed living spaces, through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as said Ingo Ludwichowski, Managing Director of the Nature Conservation Federation of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein.
Knicks are living teeth.
The Knicks were carried out on the basis of an order of Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living shells" were not only field limitation and livestock, they also supplied farmers with firewood and balks for their workshops.
From that time, the name "Knick" also comes: Through the "Umknicks" of the esthetic, the dense, folded distinctions were able to develop.
Today, about 45,000 kilometers of hills stretch between the North and the Baltic Sea and give the image of a golden, diverse and structured landscape.
According to the NABU, around 7,000 species are now being used as a replacement living space.
In one kilometre of knick, up to 1,800 different species could live and up to 30 bird pairs.
However, its ecologically important function can the knick only be fulfilled if it is properlyined in winter.
Otherwise, it will shrink into a light tree series that, in addition to the variety of species, also inflicts the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the nick maintenance may only be operated outside the gross period from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian speaks about SItuation on the site
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on the site during the tsunami?
No, I was at that time just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport in Palu was closed at that time.
How is the situation on the island?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid goods can also be logged in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which were all completely destroyed.
Also our office of "World Vision" has been destroyed, but we have temporarily installed something where we have also housed other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have fallen to the surrounding hills, where they are still staying out of fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stand up in front of their homes, there are still neighbours.
Because many food stores and even the gas stations are completely closed, people are partially cracking food and gasoline.
The public service is completely down, the national government is helping out.
Also a prison was destroyed, the prisoners are partially free and searching for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island?
Currently we have phone receipt, but before it did not work and we have only received information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people, of whom they don’t know whether they live and where they stay because people were not home during the earthquakes, but, for example, on work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information about it?
We don’t know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought “OK, no tsunami” – and then he came.
In other regions that were not affected by the tsunami, there was the false information that a tsunami hit the region and they have fallen to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Fire Ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
However, there are earthquakes every day, but that was the worst here.
We normally know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has broken down, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Investigation in Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of scheduled hearings is very limited.
With an FBI investigation in the turbo, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the sharp majority for the judge candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who is disputed for demands.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents that have been over 30 years ago.
The latest turn in the drama about the vocation of Kavanaughs accompanied by a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer threw angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate’s Justice Committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the conservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of the Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake, contrary to his original announcement, stated that he would agree, but requested an FBI investigation.
After the tumulting scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who called the severe protests on Thursday still as a "success", initially included further attacks on women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
In this way, the last doubts could be cleared, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation in Kavanaugh case
The White House has also restricted the powers of the investigators.
It will be targeted to investigate the known accusations of two women, no more, a government representative told the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go on an angel excursion."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are expected to be heard.
The mobile, in a "civil vehicle" installed radar device of the Ried City Council to monitor the tempolimit is stationed on the Garden Road from Monday, 1 October, according to the City Council.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after defeat against Mainz: Fear was felt
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory.
However, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is long known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
It was not different in the home game against Mainz 5.
I have seen every ball inside.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty room," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
Finally, the royal blue was still able to bring the little 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over the time and thus the first season victory under the roof and field.
In fact it could have happened differently.
After the leadership by Alessandro Creep 11 of the team of Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco had given security to Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and from the pressing," with increasing game duration obviously played more and more the head a role.
Do not really create a headball.
“The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me,” Heidel said, “if the team was just half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand that.”
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore continued to withdraw.
And with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three numbers of the season.
"We all have a huge stone fallen from the heart," Schöpf said, who had no unimportant part in it with his headball goalkeeper: "I am actually the worst headball player in the team."
At the end, only the victory is counting.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the initial phase with pressure and make a fireworks from it," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
We can finally be happy for a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we have to face matches over 90 minutes.
The probably biggest failure of the afternoon: King's Blue missed it rather to worry about clearer circumstances.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the Latte 59/72. or Amine Harit 62.
“Then it’t have been a big victory,” Tedesco said, “You’ve already felt the fear a bit.”
So I am glad we won.
He wasn’t the only shaker.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at the height of the eye
In front of them is the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation by Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
“I’ve made it my task for many years to bring interesting people to the streets,” explains the founder and chairman of the “Reckenfelder Treffen” – the association that works with the “Cultural Policy” alliance in the direction of the evening.
El-Mafaalani goes very slowly into reading, describes the writing process of the book, speaks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in a comprehensible manner.
With a lot of gesture, fixed numbers and the one or the other joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian author serves in answering the question of a metaphor.
On one table is the German society, on the catcent table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to judge.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not critical whether politically right or left, but: “I am for or against an open society?” he emphasizes.
In the beginning, it is more and more important, and the discussion round is increasingly running.
There is a need for speech.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands, not on the stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is at the height of the eye.
The professor of sociology does not insist on his opinion, he emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic because "first when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing lesson, he still had an open ear to the questions of the guests and also in the Foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, intensely further discussed.

The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the new building area of Landsham-South on the free market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick said.
Furthermore, the application phase for those 20 lands that the municipality offers at more affordable conditions or prices is completed - similar to the previous local model.
More than 100 applications have been received, Frick said.

With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments sponsored by the Free State.
Place for 200 people

This is how Schalkes Naldo succeeds "great sport" also on the bank
For the third time in a row not in the startelf: Nevertheless, Naldo is grateful to Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat in the Schalker Startelf for the third time in a row, but on the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-meter Brazilian had spoken so right about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle round after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual and thanked Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco for all of his professionals, the 36-year-old, who all calls it Naldo, climbed and said, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," later Tedesco said about the reaction to his vice captain, who, despite his re-existence of reserveists, did not hold any groll.
Probably, Naldo, who was celebrated as the best scalker in the last season, knows that he has not actually gotten on the scale with his coach - but for a good reason he gets a break.
A reason called “load control”.
It was not easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite honestly," Tedesco from the moment when he told Naldo that he wasn't in the startleaf.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the matter, it’s about the club,” Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can go through at this time.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which last also captured Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by demonstrating himself also on the bank as a model team player.
The atmosphere in the Austrian industry continued to accelerate its valley in August compared to the Eurozone.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month shift.
In Europe, Austria still has the third-largest mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike Austria, the PMI of the euro area rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still below the mark of 50 counters for the 13th month in a row, which indicates growth.
The only industry in Ireland broke this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
The final was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the temperature barometer fell slowly than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March with 44,0 points.
“The slightly weakened valleys could mean that the worst thing has survived,” said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry - in the third quarter at least - remains the growth barrier number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: the export orders in the euro zone have not fallen as strong as since November 2011.
Thus, the companies built jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Also in China, industrial production fell stronger in August than previously thought.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the month to 47.6 points.
The experts were expected to score 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index is based on representative surveys from 3,000 European industries.
The developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices will be raised, among other things.
