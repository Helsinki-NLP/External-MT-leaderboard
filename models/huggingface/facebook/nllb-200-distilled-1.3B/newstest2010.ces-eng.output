Barack Obama becomes the fourth U.S. president to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to accept the Nobel Peace Prize, becoming the fourth U.S. president in history to do so.
Among other things, he will receive a diploma, a medal and a check for $1.4 million for his exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief is flying to the Norwegian capital with his wife Michelle in the morning and he's going to be busy.
He first visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five members of the committee that selected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then have a scheduled meeting with Norway's King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
Then, this afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He's the fourth U.S. president to win the award, but only the third to do so while in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will be speaking about the war in Afghanistan when he receives the award.
The president doesn't want to avoid the subject because he realizes he's accepting the award as a president who is currently at war with two countries.
He's just increased the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He's planning on giving it to charity, but he hasn't decided on a specific charity yet.
The packed program will then take the president and his wife to a banquet attended by the Norwegian king and queen, the prime minister, and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reserved about the prize from the beginning.
For example, he said that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeatedly stated that the prize was not just for him, but for all who share his values.
He immediately said that it was a "call to action".
A conservationist accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police have accused the chairman of the Litoměřice Society of blackmail.
In several cases in the past year, he has appealed to some building proceedings, demanding money from investors for his benefit in exchange for withdrawing the appeal, Litomeria police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The chairman of the Litomérian Society of Nature Conservationists is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Brno sorting containers don't smell too good
In Prague, ordinary people can sort beverage containers, while in the villages of southern Moravia you will find sorting containers at every turn.
What about Brno?
There to take a few minutes to find a suitable dumpster.
I'm not saying that there's no sorting in Brno.
But it seems to me that, being the second largest city in the republic, the councilmen are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the forestry league of sorting waste not only in that we as citizens here can still throw paper, glass and plastic into sorting containers, but above all in the number of bins for such waste.
Have you ever tried, say, throwing a PET bottle in a garbage can downtown?
It's a done deal, it just takes time and a lot of nerve.
The only place I've come across so far is Moravian Square, across from the Goose.
I don't want Mr Onderka and his colleagues to be mad at me, but I don't think it's enough.
Not to mention, in other parts of the country, there's no honey in sorting waste.
A lot of my friends don't like to sort garbage like that.
From laziness.
They're a long way from the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
I offered to throw out some glass and plastic bottles after the party.
But I didn't see any colored trash cans in sight on Kounicka Street.
Luckily, I came to the right place on my way to the salmon.
But the waste was leaking out.
It's still the center of Brno, which is perhaps the most representative of the city, right?!
But ecology and some aesthetics are not of much interest to the Brno socialists.
They'd rather buy a hockey extra that would bring shame to the whole republic than buy a few more containers and offer to sort out more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to confirm my guess with official statistics after a while of surfing the Internet.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is indeed the worst in the whole South Moravian Region.
The Paroubkes' budget took money for pensions and sick leave
Once the left has added to the farmers or officials, despite the government's opinion, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, health care or building savings.
But also interest on government debt or international litigation.
This will add to the problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for increases for certain groups, they relied on the government to borrow extra on sensitive expenses, pensions, or medical care. "It's just putting problems off, laying mines", says Janota.
The money borrowed pays ever higher interest rates and must be paid back at some point.
The state doesn't have much choice where to go.
If they don't reduce social security or the cost of running the state, they have to raise taxes.
Everyone the left has added now: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children.
The people don't have to worry about pensions or health insurance, whose accounts are missing 1.8 billion, they're getting them.
But at the cost of getting more in debt, next year, not only will there be $163 billion missing from the treasury, but more.
Despite Minister Janot's efforts, the debt will continue to grow faster and faster, and with it the interest costs.
The state will need money to pay for it and it will no longer be enough to raise VAT slightly or reduce maternity pay as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the shift of funds to several constituencies, next year we will also be short of $5 billion for highways and railroads.
These are mainly already overcrowded and dismantled sections which cannot be redesigned and possibly reduced in price.
Conserve as much as possible, which is not free.
This means delays or stoppages for 30 major construction projects, and the use of European funds is at risk, warns transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The ČSSD proposed that the loss of money be solved by the Šalamunsky  will affect the dividends of the ČEZ, which are majority owned by the State, and from them the transport fund will be contributed.
The problem is, the dividend is never certain, let alone a bottomless pit.
Last year, 18 billion came from the Czech Republic.
The dividends are paid annually to repair environmental damage, to supplement the pension account or to provide a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
Moreover, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP under EU rules.
But the carnival of relocations does not end there.
Nearly $3 billion was cut in the budget for various compensation payments to victims of communism and crime, or for legal costs, even for building savings.
Whether the state can do without this money is uncertain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we will have to pay anyway, notes Janota.
The minister will then have to save money within the department or, in the worst case, tap into the government's budget reserve.
Another $100 million is missing from a $2 billion project already underway by the Treasury to allow online tracking of government spending.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister doesn't find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop, sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will run two operating systems.
Americans expect a mobile phone in the future where the user can switch between different operating systems with the push of a single button.
The plans revealed sound promising.
Just press one key and you'll be transferred from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This is exactly what VMware, a US company that focuses on developing virtualization software for computers, is aiming to do.
We'll let you run two user profiles on your phone at once.
You can switch between them, you can split them into home and work.
Both will be working at the same time, suggested Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was unveiled in November last year and premiered a few days ago.
It'll be on the market in 2012.
Smart phone virtualization is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to the press a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, which ran Windows Mobile and Android side-by-side.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization and the devices are expected to reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains is a concern for hoteliers
Bare runways aren't just a concern for mountain tugboats.
The lack of snow also discourages people from booking skiing stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That's why you can still find rooms in the mountains for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's.
We have a high traffic on our site.
People are going through the offers, checking prices, but so far they're afraid to order.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be snow or mud", said Martin Jandura, the operator of the Spindl.Info news portal.
They say if you want a New Year's stay at Spindler's Mill exactly as you want it, you should stop hesitating.
Those who prefer to save money and have second-class accommodations may try to wait a few more days.
The Spindler hotels are only offering weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to turn themselves in for a while, but then they'll also give in and leave for a shorter period of time.
And then the vacancies will be rapidly decreasing", Jandura estimated.
The Ingtours travel agency in Värmlab still offers a bed available in all winter terms.
We're most interested in the week of Christmas, which is not sold out yet.
About half the seats in our offer remain open.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute", says Ingtourss' Director Petr Schiefert.
The New Year's Eve in the mountains can also be offered by the Vrslav tourist office, but there are fewer vacancies.
Sales are good for the first two weeks of February, the rest of the winter terms are selling average.
This year, the lack of snow in the Krkonoše is a negative factor in the interest in wintering.
People are waiting to see if he'll come up with something.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed during the week, they will be sold out at Christmas", says Schiefert.
On the contrary, they're doing a little better than last year at taking over the rooms at the Horizon Hotel in the Peak of Snow.
We're about five percent better off.
We're a little short on New Year's and Christmas.
There is a lot of interest in Polish holidays in January and sales are good in February too,' said Karel Rada, the manager of the best hotel in Piec.
The hotel Omnia near the central parking lot in Janský Lázně is also occupied with 80% of the New Year's stays.
On the contrary, at Christmas, the newest hotel in Janskola is still half empty.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the ice, which is already about 60 percent full.
February is a little weaker, but once the snow hits, interest in staying in the mountains will definitely increase, said Omnia Hotel manager Erik Sporysch.
But for now, Krkonoše hoteliers must get their appetite up.
Thursday's supposed to be cooler, if there's any rain, there should be snow in the mountains.
But then the warming is about to come again, said Jiří Jakubský of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute's Hradec office.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It's funny how Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest, is so academically intent on repeating the strategy of his predecessor, whom he thought was the dumbest, on Afghanistan.
When he finally got his long-awaited Afghan doctrine out, it turned out he had written it over a copy of Bush's Iraq script three years ago.
Not only does he use the word "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he didn't even hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement as the title of his own declaration: "A New Way Forward".
Three years ago, he himself criticized Bush's idea of sending fresh troops into civil war-torn Iraq as "irresponsible and consequently disastrous".
But the months that followed showed that Bush's strategy based on the recommendations of the field commanders was the only one possible and so successful that Iraq is not even mentioned in the news today.
It did not improve Bush's reputation, but objectively left his successor with a much more grateful starting position than could have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama is hoping for a repeat of the miracle.
The increase in the military contingent was again requested by the field commanders, especially the commander in chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even in spite of his subordinate habits, harshly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House.
He asked for 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he seemed to have no choice, so at least he cheated the general out of 10,000 troops.
He managed to squeeze the promise of another 5,000 from Europe, even though he had originally counted on at least 10.
The most problematic aspect of Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete the process in three years.
Many doubt that a half-hearted increase will yield the same results as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honoring agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are being honored.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces are ill-prepared, accustomed to changing hands every day as they see fit.
Political institutions, even when formally established, will remain a shadow village, with patriarchal tribal relations still flourishing behind it.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult given the ambiguity of the situation, which is further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even building an 'actionable state', which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, does not seem very realistic.
The timeline of Obama's strategy is striking with its voluntarism.
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only gotten worse and now it's on the verge of explosion.
To believe that a soldier sent into the heat of war to "come home soon" will cause a miracle to happen here can only a truly romantic soul, untouched by reality.
Politically, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is irresponsible, because the Taliban will see it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europe's willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is heading for the negative.
European politicians cannot and will not explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is connected to the war in the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that could radically affect the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iran fail to take effect, the United States will face the difficult question of whether to try to resolve the problem by military force.
The answer to that question will come at a time when, according to Obama, America will move to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any such solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential election, and therefore plenty of time to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer be paid in cash.
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will not be paid in cash this year.
The announcement was made in response to sharp criticism of the company's pay practices.
The top 30 executives will receive stock options that can be sold in five years at the earliest.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from managers if they become excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is thus leading the effort to link Wall Street pay to long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to go in, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has come under fire after setting aside nearly $17 billion in bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total compensation for the company this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the measures announced today.
High remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political topic in many countries since the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it would impose a one-time 50 percent tax on bankers' bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar steps.
Women have won Nobel Prizes in every field except physics this year.
A record five women today in Stockholm received this year's Nobel Prizes in literature and science from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.
Besides the four women scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for their research on chromosomes.
The prize in chemistry was awarded to Ada Jonath of Israel, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz of the United States for their work on the structure and function of ribosomes.
The most recent winners were the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was awarded to American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic governance.
The only major that didn't get a medal this year was physics.
The award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyle for their invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines and astronomical telescopes.
Each recipient received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of financial reward.
The amount of the tax is SEK 10 million for each category.
If there are more honorees in each, they split the reward.
The most eagerly awaited Nobel Peace Prize was awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his award, since he is only at the beginning of his career and is leading a country that is fighting two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defense of his policy, however, he added that war is necessary in a certain situation to win peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning.
President Vaclav Klaus will host Finance Minister Eduard Janot on Friday morning, who is considering staying in the government because he disagrees with the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and possibly Janot's continuation in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is critical of the budget.
It is also concerned that the deficit is too high, which is further exacerbating the public finance crisis.
The meeting was reported by the President's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janot wants to discuss his continued tenure with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget bill that Klaus is now getting signed, the Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But the House on Wednesday approved a left-wing proposal to transfer money and increase money for civil servants' salaries, running social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has criticized the Social Democracy proposals for covertly increasing the budget deficit.
This has led to a sharp internal political dispute between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, which has raised questions about the future of the Fischer cabinet, which was agreed to in the spring by the ODS, the CPSU and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget, as passed by the House, essentially eliminates the austerity package that the Fischer government put in place in the fall to stop the government's debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the state budget bill, said at a business breakfast today that politicians have long neglected a "serious problem" that is the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He doesn't think he has a good solution today.
The President believes that only a strong government, which can also rely on a broad consensus of political parties, can bring about improvement.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget is scary and the government should consider continuing to exist.
ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer called such remarks "strong statements".
The head of the CPSU, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánka by saying that the budget deficit that the former Topolánka government prepared for this year, which will exceed 200 billion crowns, is frightening.
On Wednesday, the CPSU declared the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The people were also satisfied.
Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood 's novel
South Africans say the new Hollywood film Invictus: Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories despite some critics saying that the lead roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The life story of the tireless fighter against the apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is told by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91, asked him if he could play him in an Eastwood movie.
Another important role in it is played by Matt Damon.
I said, 'If I play you, I'm gonna have to have access to you.
The award-winning actor, 72, who starred in Eastwood's box office drama Million Dollar Baby, has played the abolitionist leader who eventually became a slave, the fictional U.S. president and even the god in Divine Evan, but rarely anyone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
A former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is Latin for undefeated, and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who belong on a global scale among outsiders.
The South African team will finally qualify for the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to the screen.
"I had no other goal but to play this part as realistically as possible", Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I found that when I press your hand, I take your energy, it's transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaire, captain of the white-dominated national rugby team.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
The big surprise for him was finally when he first met Pienaro in his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he answered, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look so much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the distinct differences in the characters compared to their actual templates under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus: Undefeated received positive reviews and there is talk of Oscar ambitions.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summed up his assessment: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film".
In the movie reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive ratings.
The secret of the glow over Norway solved: Russians test a missile
A strange light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry admitted yesterday that it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch was again unsuccessful, and the missile, designated the "Bulava", which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian military, is slowly becoming a nightmare for Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence during the rocket tests had no effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, the Bulava never took off or got damaged in mid-air.
The Russian press is already reporting the "Bulava" as a "rocket that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but it lights up
This 13th attempt in a row was initially running normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that the aircraft again suffered a technical failure.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, the "Bulava" was launched from the Dmitry Donsky nuclear submarine, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows it to be launched from a vessel that is moving and submerged at the same time.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by a more obscure flying object was indeed a malfunctioning "Bulava".
Besides, the Norwegians had no doubt from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals are defending themselves this time, saying that there is no definite failure.
The first two stages of the missile survived, and the accident did not affect the third.
In the previous cases, the engines failed in the first degree.
Although not a single test launch was completely flawless, only six of the 13 were considered failed by the Department of Defense.
The nearly 50 percent success rate thus fills the generals with optimism, and they still claim that the Bulava will one day fly smoothly and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract at the age of 51 with CSKA Moscow .
Legendary defenseman Vyacheslav Fetisov is back in the professional game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup champion will be helping his team CSKA Moscow in their time of need and will likely be playing in Friday's KHL match against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who retired at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulyas got hurt, we need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out some formalities, "the AP quoted Moscow coach Sergei Nemchinov as saying.
It's unclear if the comeback of the famous hockey player will be a one-game affair.
I think Fetisov is one of those guys who can lift the spirits of other players, said the German.
Fetisov will become Russia's oldest professional hockey player if he returns to the ice, according to the AP.
In the NHL, he played a full season for Hartford legend Gordie Howe at age 51 and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Fetisov, Kasatonov, Makarov, Larionov, Krutov five is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
He won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, the Canada Cup and the junior world championship for the Soviet Union.
In the second half of his career, he also had success in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup in the Detroit shirt.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has complied with the unions.
The management of the Hyundai wearable car company has agreed with the union to cancel all overtime.
The unions have declared a strike on Monday because of the frequent overtime orders.
This was confirmed by Hyundai Motor's spokesman, Peter Vanek.
But the management wants to agree with the union on one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign ourselves to our production plan, it is essential, that's why we proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday, December 19 with two shifts, Vaněk said.
The server Sedmička.cz wrote that the company of employees who work the Saturday shift, offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
People will get it back on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vanka, the company decided to change the way it motivated employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they get paid extra overtime or they can take a day off on December 28 and extend their Christmas holidays by one day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive paid meals and board.
Since overtime was the most urgent and most pressing point in terms of comments and complaints from union members, as well as protesting employees, who last week spontaneously stopped production, management decided yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtime for the month of December, with immediate effect, Vaněk said.
Until last week, auto workers were forced to work two hours overtime almost every day after an eight-hour shift.
After the agreement is signed, the unions will withdraw the strike emergency.
The next meeting between the company and the union is scheduled for Friday morning.
The union chief, Petr Kuchař, said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the strike alert.
The situation at the automaker escalated last week on Wednesday when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over continuous overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
Management objected to the fact that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements for car deliveries.
The unions also demanded in their Monday strike alert that no sanctions be imposed on the workers who stopped production last Wednesday.
In the overtime sector, unions are demanding that the company reduce overtime to a minimum.
And they're offering a $5,000 reward for her this year.
Hyundai's portable car company now employs 2,000 people.
The company started mass production last November.
By September of this year, it had produced about 80,000 vehicles, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a drug that works on 'toxic' HIV
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works against viruses that have already acquired immunity to the drugs.
This fact outweighs in some cases the fact that the compound does not work as strongly on the common variant of the virus as some of the drugs already available.
AIDS is not yet curable.
However, a combination of medicines that prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body can significantly prolong the life of patients.
However, their use is associated with a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of viral replication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, the University of Heidelberg and the University of Prague is paving the way to tackle virus resistance.
They showed that substances called metal carborans act on a protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV.
Metallocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way that no other drugs are able to do today, and so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists have come up with new improved compounds based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metallocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages of boron, hydrogen, and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A Treacherous and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is a protein in the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV splitting, no mature infectious virus particles would be produced.
By stopping HIV protease, the virus is also stopped from spreading in the patient's body, the researchers explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the researchers describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see chart) are linked by a short organic chain that is then systematically altered.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti-HIV proteases has been tested in a test tube and also against resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metal carborans on the normal enzyme variant is not as strong as that of clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications make both metal carborans interesting compounds for further research into the design of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS has gotten into Fischer, he's defending himself.
The head of the ODS Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for next year "terrifying" and said that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider continuing to exist.
The Prime Minister called the ODS's statement strong.
He says he's saving time for analysis.
ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Nečas said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Neczas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he wants to rely on the minority in the House to fight the growing deficit or to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and social democracy to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Nečas pointed out.
The House of Representatives on Wednesday passed the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments worth more than 12 billion crowns.
The House increased money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's cost to the Social Democracy proposals was that they were secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the room before the vote, so that the government's wishes were fulfilled that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the provisional budget.
Disappointment and Vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would evaluate the situation further.
In time, he is convinced that if he had seriously threatened to resign from office if the amendments were adopted, the situation might have been different.
According to Czech TV, Janot has an appointment with the Prime Minister for Monday after the government.
He has indicated that he is considering continuing in office.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks out in favor of further fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas, the nominees of the ČSSD, which has implemented changes in the budget, have nothing to do in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House passes any more deficit-increasing legislation, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or the amendment to the Employment Act.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by ODS are not guilty
It's a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the US.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people in deputy positions who belong to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
He pointed out that if Fischer decided to abandon the principle of tackling the deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he should rely on the left majority that is currently in the House".
Then he says he can't count on the support and tolerance of the civic democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and when it becomes relevant, I will deal with it, Defense Minister Martin Barták told reporters in the House, who was just nominated to the government by the Citizens' Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels this afternoon for a European Council meeting.
At the Prime Minister's request, the ODS backed down.
He also pointed out that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in the House on Wednesday, unless the Prime Minister had explicitly asked the MPs of the Civic Democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We don't feel like orphans, we're not little children, he said, responding to the question whether the ODS was bothered by the absence of the party chairman in parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
"I knew that in the coming months it would be about the Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of everything positive", Topolánek himself said.
Under the new regulations, fewer trains will run at almost the same fare.
The Czech Railways will cancel or reduce some of the less busy express and local services from 13 December, while strengthening others.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by 2% from today's level as of the date of entry into force of the new timetable.
Most fares, including basic and passenger fares, will remain unchanged.
For example, Ostrava residents will have more connections to the capital, with the tracks adding one pendolino set to this line.
The express train, on the other hand, will stop running to Bratislava.
Fewer express trains will also run on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, which will significantly limit the direct connection between Prague and Letohrad.
Of the regions, the railways plan to reduce traffic the most in the Královéhradec region, by a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can enjoy an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route are also cancelled and the operation of several express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route is limited to certain days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today the Milovici have to switch in Lysé nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko suburban system, and its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the Prague Central Station.
ČD will establish multiple connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run at two-hour intervals.
From December 13th, the pendulum will no longer be used by passengers.
This year's regional rail bill: 200 million more
The Ministry of Transport orders and pays for the express trains, and in total, the so-called demonstrable losses will be compensated by the railways next year, as this year, by four billion crowns.
Regional trains are $200 million more expensive this year.
The railways have a new 10-year contract for both local and express trains, previously the contract was always for one year.
The routes praise the system, which is why it seems that the vast majority of fares have not been increased.
The changes will only apply to ČD Net one-day network tickets and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 CZK.
The cost of the ticket will now be based on the distance travelled, previously it was 160 CZK for a journey between any regional town.
The Filipino armed forces are still holding more than 50 people, children have been released
Armed men abducted 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 abductions.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 gunmen are reportedly using the hostages as human shields to flee from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the gunmen belong to the New People's Army (NPA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police initially pursued the kidnappers because of the violence that required settling scores between two local family clans.
Martial law was declared in the southern Philippines province of Maguindanao after a recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the gubernatorial election were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of the JAR is for everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days, Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film Invictus, which chronicles part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela, will hit theaters.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was played by Morgan Freeman, who was reportedly chosen by Mandela himself to play him years ago.
The male supporting role of legendary South African rugby champion François Pienaire was played by Matt Damon.
When the film is released in cinemas, it is met with critical and public acclaim.
Nelson Mandela is here .
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezi, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The report, which is expected to be published at a time when South Africa is at the height of preparations for the World Cup, is also being shocked by alarming reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the new film has received mostly positive reviews in South Africa so far, despite numerous reservations about casting "flat-faced" Hollywood stars in the lead roles.
Morgan Freeman, however, said he was proud of the new film.
I've been dreaming of this part for years and I've been preparing for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela many times in person to, as they say, draw on his energy, he said in an interview after the film's premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can use the film to remind people of Mandela's personality and message.
It's the story of South Africa, but it's about every person, he added.
In the national rugby team jersey
Based on the book by British author John Carline, The Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation, the film portrays a South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, in the course of the film, tries to bring together two racial and long-defined populations and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he enters the field in the South African national rugby team's rugby team, which won the World Cup.
For entering the grass in a jersey, which is considered almost sacred in South Africa, Mandela received a standing ovation from a mostly white audience 14 years ago and won recognition from the white population.
Perhaps the soccer championship can bring people together again as one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as revealed in a recent interview with the United Nations by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country for Britain.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
A tens of millions of crowns worth of transformer is on fire in Lounsko
The fire broke out this morning in a Cheps transformation plant near the village of Výškov in Lounsko.
According to the spokesman of the mouth of the region firefighters Lukáš Marvan, six units are involved in the fire.
Initially, the firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn, but later they changed their minds and put out the fire with a mixture of water, foam, and special extinguishers.
The cause was a technical malfunction, an internal shortcut to the transformer.
No one was injured, but company spokeswoman Pavla Mandatova said the crash did not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at tens of millions of crowns, which can only be accurately calculated after the fire is over.
The Mandata says the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced.
Nothing like this had happened in the 10 years that Cheps had been in business, and the failures of this type are rare, she added.
According to ČEZ's spokesperson for Northern Bohemia, Soni Holinger Hendrychová, electricity supplies were not interrupted, and the functioning of households, offices and businesses was not affected by the fire at the substation.
A.s. Čeps is the sole operator of the transmission system, 400 kV and 220 kV power lines in the Czech Republic.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers converting electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and a 4339 km line.
Jančura will file a criminal complaint for defamation against three hejtman from ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jančura, will file a criminal complaint today for defamation against three social democratic headlines.
And that's on Michal Hašek from the South Moravian region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice region and the chief of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařik.
Yanchura reported it in the 20 Minutes Radio Magazine.
The complaint concerns the company's attempt to operate regional train services in certain regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three of the captains are attacking us and talking about picking raisins, when we only brought an offer on what they wanted.
They say we're more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It's for defaming the Student Agency, he told Radio Jančura.
It also stated that it had evidence from all the regions that they had not acted in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hashek sees the criminal complaint as a continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves as unpaid advertising for his company and himself.
I am prepared to defend my good name and that of my county and I urge the other chiefs to do the same.
I assume that it will also be clear on this occasion that it is Mr. Jančura who is manipulating the public on the issue of regional rail transport and using false and untrue arguments, said Hašek.
Last week, Yančura announced that he would invest several million crowns in advertising to warn the provinces about the disadvantageous move.
He told the radio magazine that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and continue it after the New Year.
He made it clear that the campaign would be against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional rail links with České dráhy and did not tender for a contract worth around CZK 150 billion.
According to Jančura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
He said that the Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD) MP had threatened Jančurov because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know which gentleman it is, I will not say his name, said today to Radio Journal Jančura.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination from January will break established habits.
It's supposed to be a first for families, free and optional.
But there are already voices that say mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are in full swing.
The FDA already sets the maximum price of vaccines that health insurance companies will pay.
Experts are also now clear on the procedure for vaccination.
New vaccinations
Free vaccines for August kids
From January, children born on or after 2 August of the previous year can be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease free of charge.
The condition is that they haven't received a single dose of vaccination.
Those who started last year or earlier must pay for their own revaccination.
The first dose of vaccination should be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, a quarter of families volunteered to have their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
Parents paid $1,600 for a single dose or more.
Four doses are required for the youngest children.
In total, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend between $300,000 and $450,000 a year on vaccinations.
But it saves on the treatment that children without vaccines would need.
So far, the state has given about 500,000 a year for all the vaccinations of children.
The vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcal causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
A study in the United States found that 28 children under 10 die each year from pneumococcal infection.
In addition to the Czech Republic, around 40 countries have introduced a paid-for vaccination scheme against pneumococcal disease.
Will vaccinations be required?
At the same time, however, there are suggestions that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
It's going to be covered by insurance companies and optional from January.
For example, the head of the civil society association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsky suggested that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has been a long-time advocate for the pneumococcal vaccine.
The experts at the international conference our association attended were not entirely satisfied that we had voluntary vaccinations.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we're glad we got at least this one through.
I think that's the path we have to take now, Kalovsky said.
But the health department won't change the pneumococcal vaccination policy.
"We are not considering it at this time", said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors
Hana Cabrnoch, president of the Professional Society of Pediatric Surgeons, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
"In a situation where this vaccine costs so much, we can quite understand the political decision to start the vaccination as voluntary", says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of new parents to have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcal disease by next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also groundbreaking in that it is the first comprehensive childhood vaccination to be paid for by health insurance, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, which will save on further treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy their own drugs
But there is a concern among practicing pediatricians about purchasing vaccines.
The original plan was for vaccines to be purchased by insurance companies and given to doctors in the same way that the state supplies the ingredients for other vaccines.
Some members of the House, however, feared that this would "pull money out of health insurance".
Doctors will have to buy the drugs and wait for insurance to pay them back.
It is estimated that individual pediatricians will spend 40,000 a month on vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnoch.
Son of an American artist 'stealing from a museum'
The son of renowned American fantasy author Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania State Police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
Named Mr. Frazetta and the other man used a excavator to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains.
Mr. Frazetta Sr., 81, is best known for creating the characters of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
The artist was in Florida at the time of the incident, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying that Mr. Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated by a long-standing family dispute.
Mr. Frazetta, 52, issued a sworn affidavit to police stating that he did so at his father's direction "to get into the museum by any means necessary and move the paintings to the sorting rooms", the agency said.
Mr. Frazetta Sr. denied granting any such permission, as the agency has stated.
Labour is opposed to a planned tax hike
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling put it, the Tories "missed" an opportunity to show they were serious about delaying deficit reduction decisions until after the election.
Even the chancellor has come under fire for disabling low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, the main measures are a 0,5% increase in social security and a 1% adjustment in public payments since 2011.
Confusion About Social Security
Unions protested that low-wage workers were being punished for a recession they did not blame and warned in advance of "problems".
Social security is rising - an increase of about £3 trillion a year - which has angered the business community, who say it is a tax on employment, while it should be focused on rebuilding the economy.
This increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
The key points of the PBR
Social security will increase by a further 0,5% from April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected by 4.75% this year
New tax of 50% on bankers ' bonuses
Increase of 1% in corporate tax for depreciation of small businesses
Reduction of taxation for electric cars and wind power plants
Increase in the calculation of pensions by 2,5 %
According to the Treasury, some revenues of £30,000 will be reduced by £90 a year, and some revenues of £40,000 will be reduced by £190, while some revenues of £10,000 will be increased by £110.
Ministers announced that their target of halving the deficit by 2013 was a 'complex decision', but insisted that 60% of special taxes should go to the top 5%.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax increases and spending cuts would be "a drop in the ocean" compared to what would be needed.
"These are big numbers. They will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years", he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was convinced that growth would start at the turn of the year.
But the development of a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the amount of borrowing needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be considered after the chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In its opinion, it said the economy had contracted by 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April - as borrowing was £3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
A wasted opportunity'
The Conservatives, who launched a new campaign on Thursday warning of a Labour "debt crisis", have called a planned £789 trillion loan over the next six years unsustainable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan for how this could be paid for, he added, "cynically postponing" the decision until after the election - which must be held by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that was feasible", said Shadow Chancellor Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it".
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win it"
Roger Bootle, from Deloitte.
Labour insists schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike Tory proposals, which would have cut the deficit faster and more widely.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that money raised by tax increases and spending cuts should be used to support spending next year rather than to reduce the deficit, and they argue that the plans are "built on sand".
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said that the timing of the announcement - for example, the above-mentioned inflation will rise and the benefits will be unable to be paid next April - could lead to the chancellor being accused of campaigning if the money is difficult to recover a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special aid if people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
Suspicious budget
While ministers did not disclose details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that the reduction in public spending would be only the beginning of medium-term constraints.
The renowned Institute for Budgetary Studies said the chancellor's figures suggested substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defence in the future.
"It's really very painful so far", said its director Robert Chote.
"All the important announcements will come after the election if we win it", added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte's auditor.
"That was a report on a suspicious budgetary forecast.
The FBI is conducting investigations into 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating five Americans in a Pakistani prison on suspicion of extremist links.
The men were arrested for an attack on a house in Sargodha in the eastern province of Punjab, the US Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these were the same men who were reported missing last month from their home in Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also seeking information about these men.
Three are said to be of Pakistani origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestry and the others are from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances in which they were held", said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency has been informed of the arrests and has been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities here and whether they are really missing students", she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested at a home belonging to the uncle of one of them.
It said the house had always been a focus of local police interest and that no charges had been filed against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, Reuters news agency reported, but said the United States must "work much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to uncover the infrastructure of terrorism that is conducive to recruitment and training".
The disappearance of these five students from their home in Northern Virginia was reported by their families in late November.
Refusal of amnesty for Iranian oppressors.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been for the past 20 years, according to an Amnesty International report.
The report details the "torture methods" used by the regime before and after the disputed presidential election in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran denied the above criticism of the report on human rights.
Officials have described the criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were imprisoned and dozens killed after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them were remanded in custody, and the prosecution sentenced the last five to death.
The BBC's Tehran correspondent John Leyne, now based in London, reported that earlier in the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had declared certain forms of torture illegal and banned them from being carried out at the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the law has been tolerated, as our correspondent noted.
False confession
Amnesty International quoted a report by 26-year-old computer engineering student Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook" and protesting the election results.
"I was often beaten in the face", he said in his statement.
"They burned cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened to execute me and humiliated me".
After five days of signing a false confession, he was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was arrested after the election after protests and tortured to death in prison, and others were raped.
Senior Iranian officials have denied the rape allegations but admitted that torture was taking place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he was held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees should not be published.
The group said at least 90 people were detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope has been created in the city park
Over 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn the Bristol Memorial into a race track.
The race track in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for prizes.
At the top of the runway in Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping bridge in front of a 100-meter runway.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a beautiful view from the top of the runway, but it was really depressing.
It was a beautiful view of the city lights down below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents", he added.
Prizes were awarded for the best pieces or maneuvers on the runway.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters are calling for a ban on minarets and alarming reports of the alleged Islamization of Europe are spreading, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and pondered whether Muslims can integrate - and are integrating - into one of the most open secular societies on the continent.
Some readers have become admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French Don't Like Head scarves" (2006), an elegant and thoughtful study of the controversial issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious scope.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the bottom.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now serve the 5 ÷ 6 million French Muslims, what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim enter into a marriage in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about gay rights and development?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Does a Muslim have the right to use a profit-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
These seemingly mundane issues are discussed and are part of daily life rather than the political dramas that occupy the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others widely known, including Tarik Ramadana, Arab, Muslim scholar and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have no argument for all their customs.
Conservatives are suspicious of the true idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists Mr Bowen interviewed tend to assume that this is the antithesis of the Salafi supporters of the purist Sunni Islam group based in Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromise on both sides.
He wonders how committed French politicians (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend the lay public) really are to the idea of pluralism.
It is believed that Muslims are probably less experienced in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than develop pragmatism, he found "a tightening of the screws of values".
After reading this book, some might be inclined to say, "Yes, but not now".
The Most Dismal Prospects in the World
The Arctic is changing faster, more dramatically than any other environment on the planet.
The fringing ice is melting at an alarming rate, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be focused on new natural water resources, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their awakening.
In his book On Thin Ice, author and illustrator Richard Ellis describes the natural history of the polar bear icon.
Well versed in the complex history and practices of whaling, he describes a long tradition of polar explorers trying to capture the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a brave 14-year-old swimmer who fought only with a musket ball is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming over the bodies of their newly killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the turn of the 20th century, 75 polar bears performed in one circus tent at a time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are typically a million times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild.

Mr. Ellis draws on the work of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat of poachers threatening the survival of the species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they hunt from helicopters and Indians on skis, all armed with powerful assault rifles to shoot their prey.
The irony is that it's happening in the waters north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will end up being the biggest.
In his new book "On Ice", Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and uneasy responsibility for science in the Arctic and a captivating glimpse into how the future may change it.
Not everything scientists can answer.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers don't have an adequate answer to the rate of change.
It's for lack of testing.
Fridtjof Nansen's exploratory journeys in the late 19th and early 20th centuries provided the first indication of how floating ice moves.
Submarines during the Cold War then mapped the shifting trenches as they sailed through them.
Satellite surveying and a vast field of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but much is still being done by fearless individuals camping in the winter.
Mr Anderson looks at the extremely fragile world of the precipitation system within the Arctic ice, created by the flow of saltwater that shrinks as it freezes.
But from the above-mentioned bear to the microscopic wonders of the universe, all of this is doomed to extinction once the summer ice moves, which will happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... it could be us.
6,000 Marines laid wreaths at the graves in Arlington.
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, travelled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, it was a day to honor the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
"In a few months, when we board, it could be us", Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happens to us, I want someone to do the same for me, to show me the respect that I'm trying to show.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the Veterans Cemetery in several sections of Arlington's drinking act.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Funeral Company in Harrington, Maine, started the tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves in a ceremony in Arlington.
Now, it's been an 18-year-old tradition for Mr. Morrill and his wife Karen to make this trip every year, stopping at various cities along the way to honor military service members and victims of terrorism.
Worcester's not looking for a profit, crowns across America, which they lay in other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery, the Pentagon grounds, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the memorial site of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated over $150,000 to buy and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington to honor her late husband, a member of the armed forces.
Since her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt stated that it was her way of giving back to what makes a sacrifice.
It's a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in warm cloth, volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to older WWI, WWII and Vietnam war graves, because they're not as frequently visited as newer ones.
The mood was positive as the children played and held hands together as they carried the young pine tree to the fallen tombstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red arch at the top.
Nearby in Section 60, where most of the veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, it was really quiet.
The Associated Services organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the ward, but the gloomy mood of the ongoing wars filled the area.
Some wept earnestly, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cold air.
Some read out loud the names carved into the stones, while others stooped to look at the small black and white name tags that were pushed into the wet mud where the headstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from their eyes at their son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the final resting place of heavy artillery sergeant David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. My son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been gone for so long, I want to be the one to remember him".
An American government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who was importing cell phones and laptops into the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The supplier, who has not yet been identified, worked for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, were seeking access to the detainee, who was taken into custody on December 5.
Certain charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything labeled "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical statements, carry the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs. Sanchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to collect the prizes, but permission has been denied.
The detention of the American supplier may be a result of growing tensions between Castro's communist brother, who rules Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been seen as a "deterrent tactic" in improving relations with the island.
The first to report the arrest was the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasized that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Cell phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average state employee salary is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy cell phones this year, which are mostly used for texting, as a 15-minute phone call would cost more than a day's wages.
Internet access on the island is extremely restricted.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and at some government facilities, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to apply must report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
It's rare to catch an American in Cuba.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berben, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't give any more information about the prison.
The imprisonment and detention were clearly immoral.
Activities that would be legal in any other open society - let's say free cell phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. program for a human rights group that recently released a report on Cuba's freedoms, titled "The New Castro, the same Cuba", in reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader and the replacement for the disgraced elder brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in the same day.
He said that any solution would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States just as the two countries are moving toward a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials uncover a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered an alleged leader of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help expose a vast network of terrorist recruiters who spy on the Internet and track down radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for a gray rebel figure known as Saifullah who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one of the men posted a comment approving of the terrorist attacks on the YouTube video website.
Saifullah took over the leadership of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, tried to help them get to a remote area of Pakistan in the tribal area of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convict al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of a CIA attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were dropped off for several days in the eastern district of Sarghody, far from the treacherous mountains in the northwest that had become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered a strike group.
The reason for the suspension was given by an official who spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to get permission to access al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested under Pakistani law.
The case of these five -- who remained in Pakistan and were questioned by the FBI -- highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is credible.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence community has made it a top priority to try to place human resources into al-Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as sentinels, eliminating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
The fake American recruits were subjected to special scrutiny by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American objectives and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become much more careful about who they allow to join them in recent years, as U.S. intelligence agencies have recruited experts on their recruiting methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has been followed so much?
This model is one of those that's much more web-based.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday demanding more action on climate from negotiators at the city's Bell Convention Center.
Protesters put the number of participants in the event at several hundred thousand, but police say the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm, with a handful of masked activists laying several small bombs near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of the minor incident at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city carrying banners that read in English, "This is not Planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish that read, "Earth says 'enough.'"
Several celebrities attended the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she had traveled to her mother's hometown in Peru and provided me with information about the dire state of the country, which is still being affected by climate change.
That's part of the reason we decided to join this great march -- to go around the world and call on world leaders to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding deal, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided all the time.
Police prevented protesters from approaching the Bell Centre and said they had detained 19 people, primarily for either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one bystander, who did not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate rhetoric, activists dressed as athletes and in black suits placed several bombs near Copenhagen's main canal, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated outside the buildings, he said, starting with flashlights, but then followed by "several large explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably went unnoticed by key officials, such as Su Weie, China's top climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English, "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of".
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the scene is so big, I can't hear what's happening outside".
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful, depending on each person's prospects.
He said the focus of the general public and different sectors and the subject of climate change was visible.
In other words: "It can also be said to be an interference with the conduct or freedom of other persons.
The test data revealed persistent racial disparities
Last week's federal certification of mathematics proficiency was a welcome piece of good news for the District of Columbia public school system.
Although the district lags far behind the nation's top performing systems, the certificate shows greater progress in fourth and eighth graders over the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest figures from the National Center for Teaching Advancement are the persistent disparities in achievement between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average grade of white fourth graders in the District of Columbia has increased from 267 to 270 (out of a possible 500) in the past two years, but the average score of their African-American peers has increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in knowledge actually increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress for African-Americans in eighth grade remains broadly flat, with a statistically insignificant one-point deviation from 245 to 245.
The average score for white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over the next six years is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was conducted in the district, was 60 points on a scale of 262 to 202.
Although the outcome improved for children in both groups during this period, the difference barely approached 58.
Some district education advocates have said in the past week that the results celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) have been more stimulating for white students where they were already performing well.
That would suggest that we've increased the overall support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, executive director of the D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equal employment in the district.
I'm not jumping up and down for a two- or three-point spread, said D.C. Committee member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Ms. Rhee's management style, Ms. Brown said that the reporting of test scores meant the city's high school system was in a desperate state and needed attention.
You obviously always want to see the good stuff, and I respect that.
But the terrible thing is that we have given almost no time and energy that we should have given to our high school education.
Ms. Rhee said the district's effort is to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained to use the new reading curriculum, the Wilson reading system, aimed at upper elementary school students and high school students who failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their cycling career are significantly behind their peers.
The daily math and sixth grade math curriculum, emphasizing play and real-life experiences, that came to the district under former principal Clifford Janey can be attributed to the NAEP progress report released last week.
And I just think we should continue to work and do the best we can to intervene with those students who are below the classroom level, Ms. Rhee said.
Others said that the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Ms Rhee can continue to raise the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources to the underperforming schools, which is necessary to narrow the gap.
It's a sort of dilemma for Mrs. Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies test scores in urban areas.
The conventional course of action is to focus resources and administrative reform on schools located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
So focus can bring political echoes that go against an important agenda.
But the blame also goes to other city managers who try to maintain a white-black middle ground.
We need to focus on building a great school system.
We need to strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can be confident that their children will receive a quality public education.
Mr. Janey, now the superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the key to narrowing the achievement gap is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to make schools eligible.
You have up to 200 days to enforce the changes, said Mr Janey, who signed a contract with his teachers' association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he sees as a "sign" to seek a bigger increase next year.
Making higher education part of a better future
The bus entered the Gettysburg Railroad with a loud sigh.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped out and rested for a moment on the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawns.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never set foot on the track.
Now she and the other eighth graders in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38,690 a year, their status was more than intimidated visitors enthusiastic potential students.
That's right! called Graciela, who wanted to study medicine, when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? She said thoughtfully when they told them about the low student to teacher ratio.
Pennsylvania College was one of seven they visited on their three-day tour, and now they were fully engaged with the future message: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is, where?
But this is a major problem with the high number of U.S.-born children of Spanish immigrants who are kicked out of college or get pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands who get a college education and enter the middle class.
In fact, one fifth of this "bow generation" of Spanish college students - remarkable results show that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, made it to the United States without finishing college.
Their success story is important, researchers say, because it highlights their point of passage for a generation that played a marginal role in the nation's labor force.
Those who have achieved, who have achieved a college education, say they have a natural affinity for school and an innate drive to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to compensate for the ignorance of the American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and the millions of children who would like to attend college - especially if these efforts are sustained over time.
Considering that children come from low-income groups whose parents lack the experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every point will not solve this problem, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who studied students from the Latin American region.
We need to think about providing these kids with a net of trapping in preschool with all the means to get through college.
The federal program that funded Graciela's railroad trip is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to launch college preparatory programs that start with low-income students in high school and continue until those students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than 1 percent of whom have gone on to college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get major oil companies to rebuild their health-care infrastructure during two auctions held on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been signed by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in rebuilding Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies have gone out with equity stakes in just two of the 10 fields being auctioned.
Seven American companies have paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one made a losing bid.
Two American companies have reached an agreement on a field that was auctioned in June.
The stealthy involvement of American oil giants in Iraq's open oil industry has taken analysts by surprise.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of American companies you have Asia and Europe in the front row, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
That's a long time before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the US military, are likely to deter US companies from doing much more business in Iraq, which has proven third-largest raw material reserves, analysts say.
US companies have been at a disadvantage in some cases, in particular Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into agreements with the Department.
Leading American companies like Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which had maintained close ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded later this week.
The State-owned China National Petroleum Corp. participated in bidding for more contracts than all other companies and withdrew with large contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is aiming to become a major economic as well as technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Oil Ministry.
We are confident that Chinese companies will be competitive and live up to their commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected to submit bids, which were then compared by the Ministry on a barrel price basis and the Ministry is willing to pay for an increase in output above current levels in each field.
Al-Qaeda's top planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
A U.S. missile strike on the Pakistan-Afghan border this week appears to have killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
It's confirmed this could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets hit their vehicle in the quarter near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have confirmed that the missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft, the type used by the CIA in the illegal tribal belt.
They were linked to a white car that was heading to the Afghan border when it was hit, an official said along with a Pakistani CICI intelligence agent who was calling from Miran Shah.
The official said that local gunmen were quick to seize what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the victims' identities, but two US counterterrorism officials quoted an unspecified witness as saying the Somali was the victim.
Somali was reported to be a senior al-Qaeda military operations planner who directed the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan and Pakistan area.
He was involved in plotting around the world, said a senior official who declined to be named, citing the sensitive nature of US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was receiving instructions from the highest levels of Al-Qaeda and planning possible terrorist attacks based on them.
Another U.S. official said Somalia was moving quickly up the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known figure to some Americans, but he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose for us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somali would have been the second senior al-Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, and three other top operational leaders.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has dropped since the summer from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to records in the Long War diary, a website run by a nonprofit group.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
The UN High Representative in Kabul has resigned.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would resign in March, ending a tumultuous term marred by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's UN-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 more American troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said he supported the increase but expressed concern that the US timetable for de-escalation, which starts in 18 months, should be a call for the governments of other NATO countries to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the build-up of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The undertaking taken must be for the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff helping with the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the part of the armed forces must be copied on the part of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but was simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to file a report with the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's time to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun a search for a replacement.
Officials said he was choosing between Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian who previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhennem, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election, of masking the presence of massive election rigging.
Eide denied these claims, but said that the indictment of Galgraith -- who was fired -- "certainly hurt the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he was proposing a meeting with the top citizen representative to coordinate the mitigation efforts at the US command in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, because he said he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money was being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations on its efforts in Afghanistan, saying that cumbersome UN recruitment regulations undermine its ability to use its skills.
UN rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
This is a disaster and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "another significant sanction" on Iran for its lack of engagement in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a weeklong tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
It's not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is the inevitable unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also hit ordinary Iranians.
He said that a "package of incentives and prohibitions" would be required "to make the Iranian government really feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer tremendously" from sanctions.
According to a statement Friday issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leaders in warning that Iran will face serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the United Nations Nuclear Security Committee and its watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise for peaceful purposes only.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on curbing his nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial part of his stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed fuel for a reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two sides and to buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be backing away from the interim agreements - partly because, the expert says, the Iranian leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States.
"Frankly, as far as Iran's obstinacy toward the international community in some of the proposals that he actually agreed to in early October, I think that has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians", Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before it returns to seeking other options, including surveillance, in what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions".
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "baseless and unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach an adequate long-term solution".
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to oil-rich Kurdistan to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
High tensions remain between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, particularly over borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid delaying U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to quell Kurdish concerns about the ongoing depression, with U.S. officials quoting Gates as telling Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you".
In aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that read, "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One extra child means one extra grave".
Then they learned a lesson: when officials in Shanghai, alarmed by their city's low birth rate and aging population, suddenly changed course this summer and started encouraging young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We always devoted all our time and energy to one child.
We didn't save anything for others, says Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an eight-month-old son.
China's 30-year-old one-child policy has produced two generations of notoriously bullied and spoiled children affectionately dubbed "little emperors", threatening the country's population crisis.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, down from six before the policy took effect, according to UN figures.
The population distribution, where the population aged 60 years and over is projected to grow dramatically from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050, is far above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in wealthy coastal cities with a higher-educated population, like Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and older made up almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered population, while the fertility rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission for Population and Family Planning, said that many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and reduce the size of the workforce in the future".
He says it's about "being old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden".
Gradual calming down
As embodied in the country's 1978 constitution, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate ever enacted under Communist Party rule.
Couples who violated the policy faced huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese officials have promoted policies that have helped the country prevent critical resource extraction, while human rights advocates have been criticized for enforcing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to have abortions when they had their second child.
In addition, many couples have had to undergo sexist selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high male-to-female ratio.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually lenient in their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed a high number of exceptions - including urban dwellers, members of national minorities, and cases where the man and woman were single parents - and in 2007, they eased the pronunciation of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Peking University's Institute of Population Research, said that central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage multiple births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced with copies of regulations detailing how to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and to place leaflets under their doors.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction has been cold, according to family planning officials.
The Sad Response
Although officials in a rural town near Shanghai have seen an increase in interest among couples who want a second child after the campaign began, most urban districts have not reported any change.
Huinan Municipal District, for example, with a population of 115,000, still recorded four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the city's birth rate in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Yuying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's Caolu district, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people did not want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they wanted to have two children and were legally allowed to.
But like many Chinese, they just don't have enough health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a docile grasping net, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a contentious legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, a human resources manager, says that they only want one child because she was an only child: "We were the center of attention for our families, and everyone took care of us.
We weren't used to providing care, and we didn't really want to care for others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who runs a translation company, expressed it more candidly.
For middle-class dual-career parents who have reduced their birth rates, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today's 20s and 30s see their parents as the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and don't want that way of life for themselves, he says.
One child, she says, is making enormous demands on her parents' time.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the contentious questions of the space -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a resume ready by the time the child is nine months old for a good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not two.
We're the first generation with a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many casualties.
The UN panel has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
A UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching misguided attitudes and mutual slander -- focused again on Friday on releasing a document that proposes ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the short term.
The text, which can provide a starting point for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminating the way forward.
But important progress has been made in the negotiations, which have come at a bad time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by an ad hoc UN task force, this text quietly states how much money rich countries should give to poor countries to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices on key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so they can limit their carbon footprint and what the upper limit of global temperature rise should be that policymakers will still be able to tolerate.
This adds a great deal of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, executive director of the Sierra Club of Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed the six-page document, a 180-page digest of the negotiating text to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as the "big picture".
It outlines a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly reduce their emissions to 25 to 45 percent per year from 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union hastily negotiated a pledge on Friday to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change -- from managing floods and drought to preventing deforestation.
Still, Friday brought up the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the interviews last week.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Affairs Todd Stern rejected a speech calling for binding greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries compared to voluntary ones for major emerging economies if not funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had taken a tougher line on China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not join the treaty without transferring major developing countries and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to secure the restrictions and should be reviewed by external observers.
Stern's comments came an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei told the US chief climate negotiator that either a lack of "peasant sense" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" had led to his announcement earlier in the week that the United States would not provide China with financial assistance to tackle global warming.
With the future of the economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, the tug-of-war broke out both within the developing world and between the industrialized world and emerging economies.
The current battle is mostly about the preservation of individual economies rather than the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States over the fulfillment of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that the world's two dozen most powerful countries ignore the scientific imperative to take more drastic action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries became much more aggressive in finding ways to prevent big emitters from acting responsibly.
It's clearly a game of how a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America for the International Conservation Union.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to push for a legally binding Copenhagen agreement, but most of the key participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push by small island nations "has put political pressure on the whole political process" in part because they are now united and demanding action from rising economies such as China and India.
Negotiations have become more urgent once delegates have focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the remaining issues before the heads of government can reach an agreement.
Senior officials, such as India's environment minister Jairam Ramesh and China's deputy minister, got off the planes and walked through the halls of Bell Centre to closed-door meetings and new conferences so they could outline claims that would be reviewed next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- where 13,000 people commuted daily to and from the convention center, activists playing guitars staged ironic views of the countries they believed to be sending them at night, and proposals were handed out hand-to-hand on paper rather than by e-mail -- was driven by the call.
The intensity is only superficial: almost all the key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier in the middle of the 60 heads of state.
We've gotten into the high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, deputy minister for global policy at the International Conservation Union.
Weights are coming in.
Britain's first 140-mile-an-hour train redefined this Monday's sentiment
At 5:13 on Monday morning, a whistle broke the darkness at the departure signal of a train that marked a transport revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach 140 miles an hour and will run from Ashford, Kent to St Pancras, London, covering a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of State for Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed passenger train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually link Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and link the large agglomerations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Neglected standing water should reduce travel times on passenger and commercial routes and the switch from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
Theoretically, the three major political parties have been won over to this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable fight over projects, and concerns about environmental damage have now held back Britain's high-speed rail.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, handed its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
She provided him with a detailed route map for the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new route linking London with the West Midlands was designed to be within five metres of urban areas and neighbourhoods where the environmental impact could be problematic.
In the open country, the final route was planned to be within 25 meters.
HS2 also envisages identifying three options for the large northbound high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped configuration where one high-speed line should lead to the West Midlands.
The line is to be split near Birmingham with one branch running from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other heading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One of the tracks should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most efficient choice has been made", said a railway expert.
Once this is done, travel times between London and Edinburgh will be cut to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open until 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to more than an hour at present.
The proposals are to allow trains to run at 2,250 miles per hour, making the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is already designed to carry trains 400 m long, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London to Birmingham route.
The Commission notes that the airport services agreement between Ryanair and AMS was signed on 1 January 2013 and entered into force on 1 January 2013.
In view of the capital constraints, it is envisaged that the existing stations would be extended to cover the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts say only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not come until after the general election.
Even if it sets the wheels in motion, the network should be built in pieces.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines but on existing lines north of Birmingham and keep travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered a crucial intersection for ensuring the transition from planes to trains, a landmark for the railway revolution.
The taxpayers have paid a £75,000 mortgage on the Tory orange shop.
Alan Duncan, the Tory frontbencher in the House of Commons, was paid thousands of pounds by taxpayers last year for an orange grove he built in his home in the constituency.
The prison party spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living on "rations", raised his mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak-lined extension to his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, totalling hundreds of pounds a month to the taxpayers.
The city council approved the claims in time and so he was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legge, who was in charge of checking member expenditure.
Mr Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns two two-storey houses in the village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth about a million pounds.
The ground floor has a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the finance office has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is designated as an "orangery".
Neighbors describe it as "a glasshouse for entertainment and hospitality".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last review by the Committee on General Standards and Privileges in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month he broke the rules after reviewing his spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan converted the pupil's security on a mortgage of £27,1406 from his London estate into a house in his constituency which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became a Member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan claimed approximately £1,400 a month in interest on the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to over £1,800 a month.
The interest on the RBS repayments of Mr Duncan's mortgage could not have changed at this time, which suggests that it was all intended to finance the £75000 loan.
The standard variable RBS mortgage repayment decreased from 7,94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year and remained at that level.
The last municipal records show that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1,250 a month in May of this year.
Mr Duncan left his job as shadow House leader in September after a secret reporter filmed him saying MPs had to live off their allowance after a spending scandal.
"It's basically nationalized, you have to live on a stipend and you're treated like shit".
He said: "I spent the money on my garden and the claim and a small fraction on what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't".
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first called in to explain his expenses in May when it was revealed that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before the Treasury approved it, that it "could be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pound-shaped pit in Mr Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed he had been claiming £4,000 for three years.
When asked last night about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for a capital increase, which was approved by both the Treasury and subsequently Legg".
He added: "It's not a matter of hiding and clicking or breaking the rules or anything.
It's an absolutely straight line down, by the rules, legitimate, and that's it.
It could not be cleaner or simpler in many other ways".
Come all of you to take a good look at the cabin on the Brighton coast with the Advent calendar.
Brighton's seaside cottages have found new meaning to life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages creativity in making a living, invited 24 homeowners to decorate their cabins for each day in December, using Christmas cards as the theme for the decoration.
The event began on 1 December, when visitors were allowed to tour the last hut from 5.30pm to 6.30pm each day, and bishop's bread and sparkling wine provided free of charge.
Selected Christmas carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, with the cottage featuring work by Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, TV marketing assistant from Hove, an unpaid priest in the Diocese of Chichester and the head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important for people in a post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come to an old building that is alien to us?
"The idea for the Advent Calendar in the huts came just as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way".
A strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and around the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, and demonstrations took place around the world, including in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of a UN climate conference aimed at adopting an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilisation, as the current demonstrations clearly demonstrate, had contributed to the "political toll" of a failure in Copenhagen being too high.
According to an AFP reporter, the incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the start of the march, when a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began smashing windows with cobbles and hammers.
The police immediately intervened vigorously.
In total, police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-radical groups that had already emerged at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the rally, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction", stressing that about a hundred of them were handcuffed and in jail "held in the streets even on Saturday evening" despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession quietly headed for the Bella Center where the meeting was taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
A platform was set up for the speakers, and a candlelight spiritual meeting was held in front of it, attended by former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters came by bus and train from major European cities, and besides Africans, there were also a large number of Asian participants, including a few Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue jackets, formed the first rally in the morning in Copenhagen, at the invitation of Friends of the Earth, a group that wanted to create "blue waves" for "a just climate".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand the payment of the ecological debt to the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: it's time, said the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and streams are drying up, and we can walk in them now, and we never could before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which began in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement for a different world has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure in the fight for a different world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice".
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly vulnerable to climate change.
In Australia, some 50,000 people took to the streets, according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, marched in red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, and Canada, several hundred demonstrators took to the streets demanding strong action on climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the protests organized by the 350 movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
There were several dozen people in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elects its own president, Georgia denounces it as a "hoax"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent from Georgia, but Tbilisi has called the move a "hoax".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the August 2008 Russo-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 5pm GMT.
According to Abkhazian election commission officials, the turnout was 58 percent a few hours before polling stations closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced Saturday night.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia, which has condemned the election.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen under Russian rule", said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognize the independence of the territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After seceding from Georgia, after the 1992-93 conflict in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, said Kvarcija Svetlana, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapaša.
She was one of those who came to vote in the polling station of a school in the capital city of Suchumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian dominance is a major issue in the presidential election in this region on the Black Sea coast, which boasts a beautiful natural environment.
Throughout this small country of 216,000 people, huge billboards with Bagapsh next to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin are placed.
In the western city of Galle, Russian officials who had come to oversee the election were warmly welcomed by district mayor Beslan Arshba.
"We Abkhazians are grateful", he said at a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and in particular its decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
"I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations", said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, toasting the occasion with a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the election by former vice president Raul Khadzhimba and two businessmen Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized agreements signed last year with Moscow, such as a treaty that allows Russia to control the railway network of Abkhazia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he supports neither the current government nor the opposition.
To win the election, you need a majority of 50% plus one vote.
If no candidate achieves this result, the decisive match must be held within two weeks.
Climate: events in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding deal to fight global warming to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, and demonstrations took place around the world, including in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the chilly afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18 to negotiate an agreement that could come into effect on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession quietly headed for the Bella Center where the meeting was taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
A platform was set up for the speakers, and a candlelight spiritual meeting was held in front of it, attended by former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to an AFP reporter, the incidents occurred shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began smashing windows.
The police immediately surrounded them and intervened without delay, knocking several protesters to the ground.
In total, police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-radical groups that had already emerged at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
Late this afternoon, a policeman was hit in the jaw by a brick and four cars were set on fire near a squat nearby, resulting in the arrest of about 20 people, police sources said.
We're focusing on extremist groups, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen as police helicopters again took to the air.
Most of the protesters who came by bus or train from the big German cities, London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue jackets, formed the first rally in the morning in Copenhagen, at the invitation of Friends of the Earth, a group that wanted to create "blue waves" for a "just climate".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand the payment of the ecological debt to the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which began in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement for a different world has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure in the fight for a different world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice".
Oxfam called on several celebrities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen and former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly vulnerable to climate change.
In Australia, some 50,000 people took to the streets, according to organizers.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, several hundred people, mostly students, dressed in red and wearing scarves that evoke the importance of solar energy, demonstrated outside the city hall.
Several hundred demonstrators also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta to demand strong action on climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the protests organized by the 350 movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
There were several dozen people in Geneva.
The geography and history subjects will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general secondary school, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview with JDD magazine on Sunday that the subjects of history and geography would be "strengthened" as part of the reform of general secondary schools, although they would no longer be compulsory in the final year of secondary schools with a focus on science.
Now all second-year students will have four hours a week and the same general education program for all, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "hypocrisy must be stopped" because, in his view, the S-specialization is no longer focused on the exact sciences" but "in fact, it has the best students".
The EC and L specialisations cannot be for S, he goes on to stress: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals complain that geography and history are not taught in the last year of vocational schools".
An Ifop poll published on Saturday by the daily Humanité showed that seven out of ten (69%) French people disagree with the government's plan to abolish compulsory history and geography in the S-specialization of high school.
The Minister added that it was 'not conceivable' to abolish philosophy in the programme of specialisation in the final year.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher education, while 16 organisations (students and unions) called for participation in a mobilization on Tuesday against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future high school teachers.
In the Master's programme 2 (M2), they will take an entrance examination at the beginning of the year, focusing on their subject and a further examination at the end of the year, verifying their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will participate in professional traineeships during the second year of the Master's degree and will be a trainee professor in the first year.
If you add up all the internships you will be offered before the admissions process, you get more experience with the students, almost 300 hours, he continued.
The Minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite École normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince the world of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the Copenhagen Summit targets: this is the call made at the Council this morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) at the initiative of the Ecole normale supérieure at Ulm Street.
According to an AFP reporter, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar of fifteen-minute expert presentations that will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to learn more", explained Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of the seminar, which was named after a fish in a local pond that the students had named.
He selected about 20 contributing experts from different scientific disciplines and specified that the selection was based on their charisma.
On climate change, "we can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic goals in minutes", said Jean Jouzel, who spoke to an audience of 50 without any notes, using only graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed, hoping that the audience would recognize that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific basis".
Videos of these lectures will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next Ernest seminar is scheduled for February and others will follow regularly every two months.
Late payments: anger at prison guards, planned measures
The prison guards' unions announced a "general mobilization" on Friday, demanding that they be reimbursed for bonuses and overtime for the Christmas holidays, which for financial reasons have been postponed to January.
The Prison FO (the second guards union) asked employees who will be off duty to participate in a demonstration outside the prison facilities on Tuesday morning to "block" them and to draw attention to "the theft of their wages".
The CGT for prison guards (the third sector union) called on them to "convene meetings in individual prisons and launch a fundamental mobilisation" saying it was "disgraceful and unacceptable" that "overtime and overtime pay for night, Sunday and holiday work" worked in October was not paid in December.
The first guards union, the Federal Union of Prison Guards (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization . . . to express discontent and indignation".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime hours increased significantly in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The chancellery said late in the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a communication to the prison warden's union assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts that prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the minister said in a statement.
"I have instructed the prison administration to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation created by the miscalculation of overtime is never repeated in the future", added Minister Alliot-Mariou.
The December pay will therefore be low, except for managers who receive lavish bonuses for performing their duties and meeting their objectives, Ufap/Unsa says, and for whom "there is always room in the budget".
It's just a scandal, the interregional union FO in Marseille is outraged and announces its decision to boycott until "all meetings and summonses" are canceled.
Workers will not come to work on Sundays and public holidays unless their October pay is paid in December, and overtime is also at risk in the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are given more and more work and more tasks without being provided with additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest ranking employees to pay for it, say the prison guards of the CGT in Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, the funds are still scarce, said Ufap's Secretary-General, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he gives "better gifts" at Christmas than he gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, told the "goddess" of the screen, Oprah Winfrey, that his simple rule when it comes to gifts is "I give better gifts than I get".
The president and his wife Michelle spoke on a special edition of a program that airs Sunday night on ABC about how they plan to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new, prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family gets his cut.
"Jesus loves Bo too", Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog will also "of course" receive a gift, according to preview clips of the show.
And Michelle Obama also countered her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she gets: "Oh, no, I gave you some cool gifts last year", teasing the president.
Well, that's true, of course, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately afterwards, with humor, he pointed at the first lady's pearl necklace, "And who gave you this?"
In this hour-long, very relaxed talk show with a famous host who has been a huge supporter of Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the Obamas also talked to him about their favorite gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a bicycle with a 10-speed transmission, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, had given him for Christmas.
I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas and give me that basketball, the president said.
It wasn't until much later that I realized he was the one who gave me the ball.
The first lady was talking about the dollhouse again.
I didn't know how to organize everything in the house, so I arranged all the furniture along the wall instead of around the fireplace, but I loved the little dollhouse, Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday has undergone surgery again, RTL reports he's in a state of artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday underwent surgery in Los Angeles due to "injuries" from a major surgery he had in France, but his family said the situation was "under control", while RTL said the singer was in artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker underwent another surgery on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "operative injuries" to a severed pelvis he sustained in Paris on November 26, his press office said in Paris, saying the injuries required "corrective surgery".
However, the singer's press office tried to reassure the public, saying the situation was "under control" and that a new medical statement would be issued within 48 hours.
According to RTL, the main partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into a state of artificial sleep to avoid "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll be a little more certain.
The press service, when asked by AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also reports that according to 'some sources', no drainage was installed in Paris after the first operation.
Rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for a cut in his plantar fascia.
The operation, which had been planned for days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in the art world.
But the doctor was unavailable Thursday to comment on RTL's information.
Following the surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection that occurred after the surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, told RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad time" but added that he was "not worried" about the rocker because he is a big "warrior".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid because spending 12 hours on a plane after this surgery is no fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, calmed the situation, stating that Johnny Hallyday "responds well to antibiotics" and that the infection has been "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he met Laetitia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
The singer's health problems have only increased since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had undergone surgery for a "small intestinal tumor" and then a mild infection.
In late September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, his health issues have been widely watched and commented upon, and fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to refute the report of another hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Bousquet's first in his favourite sport
Frédérick Bousquet, a Frenchman and three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championships in the large pool, won the 2009 European Championships in the small pool in Istanbul on Thursday in a discipline he particularly likes: the 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championships, the last time suit wear is allowed, only three world records were broken, although many more were expected.
One of them was beaten by the Hungarian runner Evelyn Verrasztova in the 200m relay and the other two by the men's relay team of Russia in the 4x50m relay.
A great sorrow for Bousquet, who was longing for the world record in the 50m freestyle, which he already holds in the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in a final that featured ten swimmers instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Dragan (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as he had predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if the world record was within my reach, I'd try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore suits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The suits have helped set 238 world records since February 2008, and their era ends in Istanbul, which first hosted the same competition in 1999.
The use of the suit this time did not help even German Paul Biedermann, a two-time world champion in the large pool in Rome that summer who held the world record in the hand.
The young swimmer failed to break the record he holds in the 400-meter freestyle (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian competitor Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish runner Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything into this race.
I knew I couldn't break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfil my task.
Lobintsev will be a serious competitor in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: A panel of a Romanian sarcophagus belonging to Zola has been auctioned for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to none other than French writer Emile Zola sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, well above estimates, said a Sotheby's art dealer.
The price of this six-foot-long [2.0 m] [2.8 m] [63 cm]-high [0.4 in] forehead plate, dating from the third century C.E., was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decoration, surrounded by satires and bacchantes is a rare piece, there are very few such pieces in the world, perhaps four or five", Florent Heintz, vice-president of Sotheby's auction house for ancient Roman and Egyptian art, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it is perhaps the most sought-after item, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
Emile Zola's acquisition of this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The tablet was in the famous collection of the Borgia family in Rome for almost 300 years, and then gradually appeared in the hands of French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated a bathtub in her private hotel in Paris, and Paul Reynaud, minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
It remained in the shadows for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz found out from a search of the Louvre Museum database that this tablet was part of the "relics of Emile Zola" opened from 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the frescoes "Rougon-Macquart".
An aborted attempt to get President Zelaya to leave Honduras for Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday ruled that conditions for the transportation of Honduras' ousted president Manuel Zelaya, who rebels have refused to guarantee safe passage, were not met.
After the phone call I had last night with President Zelaya, everything indicates that there is no way to make this move, said the Mexican Foreign Minister, Patricia Espinos.
A Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya has taken off again, a source in the Directorate General of Migration said.
The coup government wanted to force President Zelaya to "resign" and to seek political asylum abroad, the only way to give him the possibility of safe passage.
But the deposed president refused these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as head of state in exile.
The coup government "failed again when they wanted me to resign (...), they wanted me to resign", Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, often commenting on the five-month political crisis in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the deposed president, hidden in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Mexican embassy asked us to provide a guarantee of safe passage, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, said Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, to Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Caracas-based Telesur.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
News of Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military has stepped up security.
Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the attitude of the coup government.
They are showing their marginal attitude to international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who had grown close to socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was ousted on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election, against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He returned unexpectedly from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out, he will be arrested and held accountable for the crime of "treason" he is accused of, the coup government claims.
The coup leader Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace President Zelaya.
In a controversial election, recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries like Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until his term expires on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance encourages optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up higher on Thursday, and U.S. trade results show both the United States and its trading partners up: Dow Jones gained 0.67 percent and Nasdaq 0.33 percent.
The end-of-year data shows that the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with its technological dominance, from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index improved by 0,58% (6,40 points) to 1102,35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented FTN Financial's Lindsey Piegz.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on the "half-full glass".
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly guided by US trade balance figures, 'which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter'.
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% from September to $32.9 billion in October.
Analysts were, on the contrary, expecting the deficit to increase.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially in goods exports, reflecting the growth of the economies of the United States' major trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of Economy.com, a research firm.
However, in the United States, unemployment rose against all odds last week, with the number of job applicants reaching 474,000.
But the average number of new job applicants has fallen "to the lowest level this year" in the past four weeks, said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market also declined.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday evening, and the 30-year yield rose to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the regime shout "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime on Thursday blew the wives of political prisoners who gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, preventing another demonstration that saw dozens of dissidents arrested.
About 40 "Ladies in White", wives or close political prisoners were spat upon in the street by supporters of Raul Castro's regime as they marched towards the center of the capital demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Down with the Yankees! "Mercenaries!" "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!" "Long live Fidel and Raul!"
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilian members who came to "ensure security".
A similar demonstration against Ladies in White took place in Havana the day before, but no injuries or arrests were reported.
But in the Vedado district of Havana, about 10 dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for World Human Rights Day were detained by plainclothes police, AFP reported.
According to the journalist, the police loaded dissidents who had been whipped by supporters of the government into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents in similar conditions usually takes only a few hours.
The 2005 European Parliament Sakharov Prize winners, the Ladies in White, organized an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to dissent, of some 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the rebels to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid by their arch-enemy, the United States.
Miraculously, Cuban television reported on a demonstration Thursday by supporters of the government against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, with its Communist Party and one-party rule, is regularly accused by European and US NGOs of violating human rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
A maniac stabs an 80-year-old man and wounds five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A maniac armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during rush hour on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary investigations, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly attacked with two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in or outside a pharmacy at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, according to police and witnesses.
The seriously injured old gentleman, born in 1929, died in hospital from his injuries, according to the Alliance police syndicate.
In or outside this pharmacy, the attacker then attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
The husband, in his mid-30's, fought back and was wounded.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The other victim's life is in danger, according to police sources, apparently vital organs were affected.
The pregnant woman collapsed and was taken to hospital "in shock", a police source said.
The gunman, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still on Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
He injured two other people, apparently by accident: a man in his 30s and a man in his 40s, the other seriously.
How this all happened is not entirely clear, since it all happened in the evening hours.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to stop the maniac and disarm him, according to the AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They couldn't because he was pretty strong, commenting on the situation with Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A mob charged at him, including a city policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to stop an armed man and were wounded in the process, a police source said.
The incident took place in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passersby came to tell me there was a person out there who was hurt.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place and noticed large wounds on his stomach, said Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, another person in his 30's, also stabbed, arrived.
A man who had no identification was later arrested by state police.
The prosecutor in Nanterre referred the case to the investigation department of the police of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspected attacker was taken to the hospital Thursday night.
He's in custody awaiting questioning.
A police source has not ruled out a psychiatric facility.
Another police source said it took six officers to handle him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "completely out of his mind" like "all madmen of this type whose power increases tenfold in action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again asks for the criminal prosecution to be dropped
The lawyer for Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski again asked on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) to stop the criminal prosecution of his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence over a moral affair that occurred 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, counsel for the director of "The Pianist", testified before a three-judge panel of the California Second Circuit Court of Appeals about the gross misconduct in the trial at the time of the events of 1977.
I demand an immediate suspension of the prosecution, said Hummel, adding that the behavior of the judge who ruled on the case at the time made Laurence Rittenbanda "freeze in the back".
He said the judge (who had since died) had allegedly dealt with the prosecutor before handing down the sentence, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison , which is a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired", from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared at the end of September that he had "dismissed" the author of the document.
If the court refuses to stay the criminal proceedings, Hummel's lawyer will request a hearing to provide evidence of his claim.
The plaintiff repeated what was already said at the first trial, namely that there would be no serious consideration of the request for a stay of criminal prosecution until Roman Polanski appeared in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978 before a court ruled in a case of "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
He never set foot on U.S. soil again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayam said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial".
"We want to tell not only Roman Polaski but also the other defendants that there is a possibility of escape", asks Mrs. Asayam.
He feels that the director "asks the court for a favor and at the same time disregards its authority".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to rule, also stressed "that there are other alternatives to escape".
Attorney Hummel wasn't the only one who asked for a stay of prosecution of Roman Polanski.
The victim's lawyer, Samantha Geimer, also asked again to drop the criminal charges.
She reminded her client that she could no longer tolerate the constant harassment every time the Polanski case came up, adding, "No one in this room can say the trial was fair".
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26th in Switzerland on orders from the United States.
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he awaits possible deportation.
Wall Street is falling apart, held back by a rising dollar.
The New York Stock Exchange closed without a direction on Friday, the market swaying between better-than-expected U.S. performance and the rising dollar: The Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the closing data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with its technological dominance, dropped 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0,37% (4,06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It's still in a narrow range, trade volume has dropped very much and I think it's going to stay that way for the rest of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators which 'helped improve market sentiment in terms of stability of the economic recovery', analyst Charles Schwab concluded.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month, much higher than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate from the University of Michigan's index, U.S. consumer confidence also returned, rising sharply to 73.4 in December from 67.4 in the previous month.
But the indices were held back by a new rise in the dollar against the euro, which is the highest it has been in two months, "pushing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation", said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Tech stocks are losing ground.
The stock market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3,540% from 3,482% on Wednesday evening and the 30-year yield rose to 4,497% from 4,492% the day before.
Miss World pageant is back in South Africa.
After a month-long journey across South Africa, 112 contestants for the Miss World title are set to cross the finish line on Saturday to achieve their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This is the second year that the big beauty pageant has been held in the Johannesburg area and so far five candidates have qualified for the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were all crowned Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their time in Africa.
It was a real whirlwind.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I have seen so much and experienced so much! confided Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, now in its ninth year in South Africa, will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m.
I could not have dreamed of a more beautiful country to wear my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm lucky to have been able to experience it twice, confided Miss World Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was a time of many meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "breathtaking landscape".
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press conferences and safari, Miss is now focused on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also contested Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winner, who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with a crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th edition will be a celebration of music and dance.
The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is hard to match, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
As last year, the candidates took part in safari, visiting the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bicycle, and tasting local cuisine.
A special occasion was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Unusual for a president, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
The most memorable event will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup in June 2010, which helped the country to promote the event a little more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely be back for the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi with enthusiasm.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive".
Reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive", his son David assured us on his arrival at Los Angeles Airport on Friday, where he had flown to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday as he stepped off the plane he was on shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m.
The singer's son, who has been acting calm, said he would be taken to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles "as soon as possible", where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a post-operative infection following surgery on a severed intervertebral column he had on November 26 in Paris.
According to a press release, the singer was "put into a sleeping position" for pain relief and to facilitate treatment, for convenience.
Johnny Hallyday was put into a medically induced coma at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, after an infection following surgery to remove a torn intervertebral disc in Paris on November 26.
Due to the serious injuries caused by this impact, the singer had to undergo surgery again on Wednesday night.
According to an AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance at a French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
The head of the department of orthopedic surgery and trauma at La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catone, announced that he will fly to Los Angeles to see the singer on Monday.
The producer has made a harsh accusation against Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles have declared their outrage, says M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "went to Los Angeles too quickly with the permission of his Parisian surgeon".
I spoke to the doctor personally by telephone, and he assured me that the trip was not a problem, much to my surprise, since I had suffered from an intervertebral hernia twice before.
A few moments earlier, RTL radio said that the singer had apparently left Paris after the operation without a drain, without anything.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in art circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was working at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma caused by a brain hemorrhage.
But he's also a doctor with a shady record, multiple convictions for medical malpractice, tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the medical board, described him as "a man without scruples" who is "regularly" called before the medical board and who cannot be "even remotely recommended".
After days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He reported that the procedure had "went perfectly well" and that the post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic in nature, so the drainage was not necessary", he added.
The singer's health problems have been increasing since the summer and in any case, it seems that his next tour remains a question mark.
It is clear that the date for the resumption of the planned tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ed.) seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF is raising its voice and calling on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using their acronym.
The UDF, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem party, responded on Friday to the attempt by Nouveau Centre president Hervé Morin to take over the acronym of Giscard's former party by saying that it cannot use the acronym in any media under threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to take over the UDF, saying that François Bayrou does not deserve to carry its legacy after he has given his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This was supported by Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF trade mark, having been the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF Association Committee, led by friends of François Bayrou, who have no intention of being expropriated, broke their silence and made a formal request to the Minister and the MPs to stop using the abbreviation and to hand over ownership of the trademark, under threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have made increasingly disturbing statements about proposing that your political movement 're-take over' the UDF acronym, the association said in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 committee members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the Modem and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance centriste.
At the same time, you have considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name +Nouveau centre+, with the slogan +UDF aujourd'hui+, the letter's signatories also note.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF Committee, which asks the NC movement to 'immediately remove all references to the name UDF from all promotional materials, including (its) websites'.
It also asks Hervé de Charette 'to transfer ownership of the trademark to its rightful owners'.
If you do not, we will take legal action to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter they state that the UDF 'has been a full political movement since 1978' and recall that Mr Morin and his friends 'chose' to leave in 2007 'to create a competing movement, as others did in 2002 to found the UMP.
They therefore claim that the Nouveau Centre has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to create a committee to defend the 'moral and material interests' of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the Committee continues, 'when he registered the mark, he had not been a member of the UDF for three years' but of the UMP.
He used a scandalous and fraudulent way of not having acronym registrations to do it on his own.
This inattentiveness begins to turn into a crime, they declare, and then they ironically comment on NC's strategy: "We think that in politics as well as in everyday life, it is more valuable to make a name for yourself than to emerge from anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you have no right".
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for the abuse of the state of weakness.
A court in Nanterre decided on Friday to try artist François-Marie Banier and rule on whether he used the 80-year-old billionaire's frail state to deprive her of part of her fortune, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames on him.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his celebrity photos, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of his power, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision confirms that a trial is indeed under way in what can be described as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother and daughter fight each other and fight for control of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered an examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt by a panel of three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the public prosecutor's office in Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors to be elected on Friday are expected to report by 10 March 2010, stating whether Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what time.
I think he's going to take it.
I will speak to her about it, said Ms Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
As for François Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, the court has welcomed the decision.
The expert will show that this old lady, who needs protection, was manipulated.
It is two years since Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter filed a criminal case against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, who she accuses of taking advantage of her mother's frail state for years to obtain a billion-euro gift in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt, on the other hand, has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer she considers a longtime friend.
While the court was still considering the merits of the lawsuit filed by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday's courtroom speech by the lawyers was transformed into a family hour of truth.
Lilian Bettencourt's lawyer produced three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary expressing her distrust of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt, according to her lawyer, adds: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for 15 years.
Since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise".
The Public Prosecutor's Office in Nanterre has again found the complainant's conduct unjustified, especially since the custodial judge has recently refused her application to initiate proceedings for the grant of legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt is "fully able to participate in the trial, is not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her", confirmed Marie-Christine Daubigney, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office.
The Court finally decided that Ms Bettencourt-Meyers's entitlement to be heard at the time of the opening of the proceedings.
The managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companies, our struggle to develop economic intelligence has been futile...
For more than a decade, the management's attitude towards employees in large companies has been reminiscent of the approach taken by companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees identifying with "values" defined from above, as it was before when consumers had to be forced to produce products that stemmed from the ideas of factory heads.
By making the customer the center of business, the marketing revolution has steered market capture strategies in the right direction... even as authoritarian efforts to impose products that differ from customer preferences regularly return!
The passive attitude of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only a visible part of a much wider phenomenon, which mainly affects managers.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) an active approach and foresight" and requires employees to commit themselves to commitments that are completely at odds with the revenues of authoritarian management.
That's why we're calling for a managerial revolution that puts employees at the center of the enterprise as much as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Will internal opinion polls - like the questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - contribute to a revolution in management practices?
I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I've already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure, after various turns, preferably returns to what it always did!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of one's failures.
And finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Because they're engineering graduates, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of convenience, they adopt an old behaviorist theory, now revived by US "neuroscientists" and widely circulated without much knowledge by scientific institutions and the media.
The fact that it is possible to leverage management involvement has been shown by a recent Ipsos survey on Figaro.fr, which only reinforces managers in their position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises requires the adoption of the ultimate vision of human behavior.
It is about incorporating a fundamental observation into all management policies and practices: For employees, commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear as a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, only studies of motivational functional analysis have addressed this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they assess their enterprises on the basis of a pre-defined dossier which allows them to assess, through the image that the enterprise presents, what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilizing factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their 'social performance' and put their HR management 'on track'.
It thus creates a fertile ground for the development of sound and efficient economic intelligence.
With his speech in Oslo, "just war", Obama earned praise from the right.
The American right on Friday welcomed a speech delivered by Barack Obama the day before in Oslo, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner had championed the concept of a "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who initially mocked Obama's award on October 9th, this time applauded the presidential address, including Sarah Palin, former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, a muse of the right-wing Republican Party, told USA Today, adding that she herself had spoken about the "sometimes necessary" war in her memoir, which is now being published.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans want to have to do, but it's necessary.
He thinks all terrorists should be held there.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo justified the deployment of forces and used the speech to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think it was a really good speech, congratulated by the former Speaker of the House, who particularly appreciated the president's reference to "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I considered this speech to be completely historic, Gingrich said during an interview on "The Takeaway".
The former congressman, considered by some to be a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see a "leftist president" remind the Nobel Prize committee members that "they themselves would not be free to hand over the peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former speechwriter for George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a "very American speech".
Not only did he present himself as a "citizen of the world" as he always has, but he "spoke like an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they are living in a safety bubble that they did not create and that they are not doing too much to preserve it", Gerson said.
Among the few right-wing disgruntled are the Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "dull, arrogant and uninspired", as reported by National Review Online.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is horrified to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
"If we wrap war in a veneer of justice, we can easily justify the slaughter of innocent people", he warned.
However, the center-left press has a favorable opinion of the president.
While the Los Angeles Times continues to consider Obama's peace prize award premature, it has described his performance as "an overwhelming achievement" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international solutions to conflict, poverty and oppression", enthuses the California Daily.
Obama "gave the speech he needed", the New York Times said, calling it "simple and instructive".
Road hauliers: three marathons to a deal that will save the supply at Christmas.
After three marathons of negotiations, the trucking unions and the TLF, the only employers' organization to stay until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ended the call for a strike and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies at Christmas.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed "joy" at the signing of the agreement on Friday, after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators left early Friday morning in the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
This was despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had withdrawn from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours of meetings, starting at 11 a.m. to reach an agreement and at 6 p.m. to sign the agreement.
This conflict "would be very damaging to businesses" and "would risk disrupting the end-of-year holidays", Bussereau said.
The text includes a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% wage increase for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage at the lowest level is increased from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
It is not much, but it is a lot of effort, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we're giving our members orders to blockade no more, no more blockades of supply centers.
But there may still be some opponents who are not satisfied", he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the 'right deal', although it was difficult to admit a high wage increase in view of international competition'.
He said the minimum wage would rise by 170 euros a month and the highest by 100 to 120 euros.
It is a common-sense agreement and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the 'historic agreement'.
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an 'acceptable compromise'.
The agreement also provides for a 3% revaluation of travel expenses and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow the 13th salary issue to be addressed and the collective agreement to be modernised.
Bussereau recalled the "€100 million reduction in corporate payroll taxes" that was the subject of the government's amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which was voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a "consensus" vote.
The signing of this agreement will allow it to be applied first to the enterprises that are members of this organisation, and later to the whole sector, if it is extended by the Ministry of Labour.
It will happen "as soon as possible", Bussereau assured.
The only thing that can stop this process is the disagreement of employers' organisations.
FNTR speaks of 'bad business' as €100 million 'has already been offered to the sector as part of the carbon tax compensation'.
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to make an emergency call not because of mutual analysis but to avoid upsetting the turkey eaters in the run-up to the Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the agreement threatens to "buried a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector" in the next 12 months.
RER A suburban trains: interruption of services on weekends, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP.
The disruption of the RER A suburban train service, the largest urban public transport service in France, will continue over the weekend, as the negotiations between the unions and the RATP management on Friday, the second day of the strike, did not lead to any concrete results on the question of the premium claim.
On Saturday and Sunday, the days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 and 20 hours, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every second train will run, outside this section only one train out of four.
The connection with the SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which expect over 200 000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that 'the RATP was trying to make connections with the major department stores'.
The RER A line runs from the west to the east of the Paris metropolitan area.
The section managed by the RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was in peak operation and virtually no train ran during off-peak hours as planned.
As on Thursday, the people of Ile de France have made a different arrangement and there was no chaos on the platforms.
So early in the morning, there were far fewer people at the station in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Yvelines, than usual, partly because pupils and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer from Boissy-Saint-Léger, Val-de-Marne, explained that he got up "an hour and a half early to make sure he got there on time".
The station of Saint-Lazare is not overcrowded, the SNCF state railway announced, as it was expected to have more staff and security guards.
The RER A suburban trains operated by SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a connection to the metro.
The next general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday to review the results of the Friday afternoon meeting with management, which the unions rated as "weak".
The RER management proposes negotiating a special protocol for RER A suburban trains in all respects, working hours, career progression, etc.
But this is not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (OddoryJih).
RATP even suspended the proposals for the premium for the time being, which offended the CGT, which said that the management 'was not able to solve the problem whereas the tour operators and SNCF could'.
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, the transport undertakings will 'examine the conditions of employment more closely', RATP said.
Which is why the unionists think the company is "making fun of weekend travelers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the works committee at his Paris headquarters.
The management, which has so far refused to discuss the strike, decided to hold a meeting in the interest of "calming down".
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents announce a strike emergency.
The unions are demanding a premium of between EUR 120 (ounce) and EUR 150, of which EUR 30 is variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants) and are complaining about the worsening working conditions on this line, which carries one million passengers a day.
RER suburban train drivers earn a gross wage of between EUR 2200 and EUR 2700 and a non-regular working time and Sunday and holiday bonus of between EUR 600 and EUR 650 at the later stages of their career.
The Turkish judiciary has dissolved the Kurdish side and this decision has serious consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday ruled to dissolve the country's main pro-Kurdish party, prompting protests and demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision could significantly complicate the task of the government as it seeks to lend a hand to the Kurdish community and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become "a nest of activities that threaten the independence and indivisible unity of the state", Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of proceedings.
The decision was unanimously made by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres including its president Ahmet Türek and MP Aysela Tugluk are banned from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats in the Parliament (out of 500).
The party leadership warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament than act as MPs without political affiliation.
The decision follows a trial initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accused the DTP of obeying the "orders" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legitimate political showcase for PKK rebels.
The party claims to have no 'core links' to the PKK, but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes as the government extends a hand of friendship to the Kurdish community, offering a series of measures to strengthen their rights and try to curb Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have erupted into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court's decision, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast with a predominantly Kurdish population.
Police used tear gas and water cannon, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or fired rocks from barges.
Also in Istanbul, about a hundred people demonstrated.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk said the justice decision only "deepened despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning the party, he told the press.
The government, which is a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We're against party interruptions.
It doesn't solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete departure from the democratic proposals launched by the government, political scientist Ahmet Insel commented.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, killing seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow may come
A nice, crunching cold, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully the citizens, says the head of the winter technical services department of FES.
But so that his employees can try and learn to operate all the vehicle technology.
This weekend, for the first time, meteorologists say.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are on standby to take care of the snow and ice.
The ESF is proceeding according to a precise plan.
Once it snows across Frankfurt and temperatures drop below freezing, they head for 20 so-called A-spaces, explains Brauburger.
These sections include main and through roads such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire escape lanes, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and slopes like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3:00 in the morning.
If necessary, a moisture-resistant salt spray can be applied for up to three hours, a distance of about 4,000 miles [1040 km].
That is why the FES starts at 3 a.m. "to keep the roads clear when the traffic starts to go to work".
It's hard when it doesn't start snowing until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, "because no one is willing to make room for the divers".
Only when the snow is less, are the entrance and connecting roads, including Rat-Beil-Straße, opened.
Side and side roads are the last priority.
Brauburger knows they'll complain.
At 5 a.m., the FES will be on the road, clearing dangerous areas and crossings.
The FES usually cannot take care of all the cycle paths.
In Frankfurt, a special service is in place from 10 to 4.30 p.m. to monitor bridges, says Brauburger.
Because they form quickly, the glaciers erupt immediately when the temperature drops below two degrees Fahrenheit [2.0°C].
They'll call the police if they need to.
The Cradle of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The six-foot-two, five-inch-tall animal ran on two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short front limbs with sickle-like claws, and a long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, it would be nothing extraordinary.
But Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report in the Thursday issue of Science that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to display these body features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent of Pangaea.
Tawa opens a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It tells us a lot about the relationships, the expansion and the traits of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, unusual for Triassic sediments, says team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The discovery confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi sun god.
Sterling Nesbitt says: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are very rare, usually only individual fragments".
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
The discovery is not particularly sensational, but it does support some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of primates is often controversial.
For example, experts debate when lizards split into three major evolutionary lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and birds; the "long-tailed" four-legged sauropods and their relatives; and the herbivorous ornithischia, which included Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is the original theropod, according to analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of the Tawa hallae, researchers found evidence of air sacs, which are also found in the descendants of theropod birds.
The air sacs make bird breathing more efficient than that of mammals.
In the Tawa hallae, the spinal bones were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also had air sacs and light bones, this useful innovation was probably made by a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists concluded that it was there that the lizards first appeared.
According to this, the three lines of evolution soon split and spread from South America to all the continents that then formed a single land mass as the supercontinent Pangaea.
And the fact that the team found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods along with the Tawa hallae would also speak for it.
The three cannot be descended from a common immigrant ancestor, scientists argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, one of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in what is now Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His hypothesis could put together a distorted picture, because in South America, there are very many primitive dinosaur fossils that remain, while on other continents, they are rarely found.
How dinosaurs proved to have evolved from a relatively rare secondary line of reptiles into the dominant vertebrates of the Earth during the Earth's Middle Ages remains a mystery.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread around the world and many new species evolved, while relatives died out and the Triassic and Jurassic intersected.
The success story didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction, which the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but not the reptiles.
Or dinosaurs were better adapted so they could outcompete the competition.
The success story didn't last forever, though.
150 million years later, the meteorite impact helped another group of animals that also evolved in the Triassic and have lived in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, or Berkeley, California.
The lecturers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen joined the group.
The police evacuation of the occupied casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University has caused a worldwide uproar.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America are standing in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police intervention instigated by the presidency.
Because of the smudged walls and artwork, the university president Werner Müller-Estler had the building evacuated, which was occupied last week by striking students and lecturers.
Five students were injured.
The damage, the signatories argue, does not justify "the violent disruption of self-organized student and police command teaching".
The eviction constitutes an 'unacceptable interference' with research and scientific freedoms.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "illegitimise and criminalize protest" and distract from the content.
The Bureau has avoided the necessary discussion.
The speakers call for a moratorium on criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most strikers did not support the property damage.
Justified objection
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation also show solidarity with the students.
Protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one's own future, says the mysterious Verdi Earth Youth Alexander Klein.
Hessen's science minister, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), has so far defended the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the president of the university.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in Aktuellen Stunde (Today's Hour) at the Wiesbaden state assembly.
We have an understanding for protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Left saw it differently.
The CDU is using painted walls as an excuse to criminalize protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of addressing the students' arguments and demands, the eviction took place.
Linke has filed a motion calling on the Home Secretary to report on the police deployment.
The New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a heavily guarded site where secret weapons research was conducted.
Today, this district of 216,000 people, located 23 miles [37 km] from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russia's Silicon Valley".
It is home to major micro- and nanoelectronics research and manufacturing centres.
As early as September 2008, representatives from Greenberg established contacts with the Frankfurt Riedberg Science Centre - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
A number of mutual visits were held and on Wednesday, a 'Protocol on close cooperation' was signed in Frankfurt by Zelenograd and Ridberg.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow's mayor Yuri Roslyak and Zelenograd's prefect Anatoly Smirnov, and was signed by Frankfurt's chief planning officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs engaged in scientific research will attend a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to tap into the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large concern Sitronics, and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are located.
The brake shall be so designed that it is capable of being operated by a brake system.
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be prepared enough.
For proponents of the project, it is simply the 'new heart of Europe'.
Okay. S21 is more than just a station launch, more than a monstrous building that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate building chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the '80s.
The main railway stations, which terminated in the city centre, were then considered to be 19th-century transportation-technical fossils, acting as brakes on modern rail transport, as it took enormous time to move locomotives from rear to front.
Drive, stop, keep going - that's how it should work.
And that's why the main stations are disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the passenger station, which is located about halfway along the route of the trans-European railway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan 'the heart of Europe'.
It really starts with S21, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian capital, starting construction was almost impossible.
Since modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends have been available, the main stations no longer have problems with arrivals and departures.
Nevertheless, it starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE line to Ulm.
It was enforced by local and state politicians.
The routes cooperate, in part because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state corporation.
There are other ways to justify the project from an urban point of view.
A new urban space will be created, which, if we believe the computer graphics of the designers, will contain a lot of green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The passenger station and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - has seen a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights back then.
However, modern transport policies must be primarily concerned with strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road freight.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains because of the steep climb.
More importantly, S21 is indirectly related to a number of other railway projects.
In Switzerland, a good six billion euros were to be buried.
That's the official number.
Experts say 10 to 15 billion is a realistic number.
It is clear that in the next decade, there will be a lack of funding for additional nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
There are 60 major projects on the transportation department's list.
One of the most important is the construction of a route through the Rhine valley, some 180 kilometers long.
Since 1987, the route has been built at a slower pace.
This is where you're gonna need some real push.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The Rhine Valley line will become a bottleneck for international freight: right in the heart of Europe.
The Government is reviewing the airport judgment
The Land has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether to challenge the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the ban on night flights and have it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to review the more than 400-page judgment of the VGH, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel today submitted written reasons that the State would have to re-regulate the night-time flight ban if the planned north-west runway of Frankfurt Airport was built.
The authorization of 17 flights between 11pm and 5am, as the county government has suggested, is not in line with the law to protect the public from nighttime airborne noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4th whether to seek a review of the verdict.
The opposition criticized this delay and urged the government representatives to abandon the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to revert to their pledges to ban night flights before the election, otherwise it could be considered a "breach of promise".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, Green Party leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's criticism, saying the state government was trying to "twist the law and trick" to get its night flights.
A thorough legal review takes time.
The coalition doesn't want to work on a "quick first impression" basis.
We need realistic decisions, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction's statements on the night flight ban were never what the opposition claims.
American banks are paying back the aid
America's crisis-hit big banks are shedding their government bonds.
Bank of America on Wednesday paid off a $45 billion bailout from the Tarp bank rescue fund.
According to CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay the state aid.
The institutions thus want to get rid of the restrictions that have been imposed on the receipt of money - restrictions on the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America has secured a good $19 billion in net cash from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the money from her own treasury, which was filled up, among other things, by union sales.
Bank President Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday night specifically thanked the U.S. taxpayer: "The cash injection helped us through a difficult time".
The Fed took a hit at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the State by raising money on the capital market.
CNBC reported, citing sources, that the U.S. bank may have announced a capital increase of about $20 billion as early as Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
In June, the aid was paid by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick selection
It was faster than expected.
The station introduced a successor just two weeks after the ZDF board of directors had dismissed editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender.
Last night, the board tried to make a deal on that person.
The favorite was named Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studios in the capital city of Berlin.
But the station didn't confirm it officially, so as not to prejudge the trial.
However, they could also have played a role in not wanting to harm ZDF's steward, Markus Schächter, if the proposal was not approved by the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not known before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the board of directors with his proposal to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract by another five years.
Brender's loss of the mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although it was to be expected.
The Union majority in the board of directors had already signaled weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The resistance against the editor was organized by Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to continue in the position of highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that under Brender, the viewing quotas of the ZDF news broadcast had fallen.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence of the ZDF was sharply criticized.
Last time, 35 civil rights lawyers intervened in the debate, calling Koch's actions unconstitutional.
It was no use.
The person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey joined the ZDF, first in the "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal correspondent to the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and host of "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of foreign policy at ZDF; since then head of the main ZDF studio.
After Brender, who was voted Journalist of the Year by the trade magazine Medium Magazine on Wednesday, was ousted, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional suit.
Koch's opponent in the governing council, the premier of Rhineland-Palatinate, Kurt Beck, explained last week that the states should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the intendant's personnel proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF supervisory boards.
Brender's intended successor, Peter Frey, has handed the board a clever chess move - one that was heavily criticized by the board immediately after Brender's ouster.
This proof of journalistic independence enabled him to be nominated for the position of editor-in-chief without losing face as Schächter, and he could be elected by the board without being suspected of being pushed into office by the party.
In party arithmetic, Frey is classed as a left-wing liberal anyway.
The Studio Clears of Junk
A partial success for students: After a year of strikes, the Ministers of Culture finally visited the Länder on Thursday: At a conference of Ministers of Culture and university rectors, both sides agreed on the will to improve the conditions for bachelor's and master's degrees.
Students should be able to handle their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: in principle, each study module should be completed with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of students should be checked and a 'realistic and defensible level' should be guaranteed.
To this end, politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Länder undertake to create a more flexible common structural assignment for bachelor's and master's degree programmes.
Earth anomalies should cease to exist.
Less testing
Since the student protests began in May, the ministers of culture and university rectors have been full of words about better education.
Now, for the first time, they're filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council has decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module will normally be completed with only one exam", says a 30-page report, which is partly to regulate the approval of study subjects.
"A significantly lower test load", declared Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the Accreditation Council, is to "stop a wrong development that has greatly limited the demands of the study".
To this end, the 'demand of the study' is to be the 'decisive criterion' for implementation in the future.
Modules and content "must be strictly controlled" so as not to "unnecessarily restrict students' choice of
the seminars".
Students should have 'the right to a space that enables and encourages their own initiative'.
The rules should apply to the approval of new fields of study, after review, but also to existing fields of study.
These need to be 're-accredited' every five years , which means that it will take until 2015 before all subjects are re-accredited.
The responsibility for this lies with ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation councils set up by the Länder.
In October, the ministers of culture urged the Länder to work on the agencies to ensure that the school's class size and test regime were not too high.
In the individual Länder, universities and colleges have already agreed with the Länder ministries on appropriate measures.
The only country to date to pledge additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process is Rhineland-Palatinate.
The money should be used by universities to finance mainly consultancy programmes and study counselling, and to strengthen examination and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
In early 2010, the government plans to submit an amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
It considers that only one single exam should be required to complete the study module.
The degree structure should be made even more flexible, with the recognition of examinations from other higher education institutions guaranteed and the accessibility of the master's degree facilitated.
By the end of next year, the demands of all fields of study in the country should be reviewed.
The government and opposition again discussed the conditions of education in the country on Thursday.
The resolution was praised but criticized.
The Juso Federal Board of Higher Education Groups called for education policy-making not to be done in the future "behind closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
The students as concerned should also "have a say" at the latest after the strike.
The future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of University Rectors (CHR), Margrethe Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom the CHR was consulting on a joint reform report.
According to the Education and Science Committee (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: it demanded a legal entitlement that would allow every graduate with a bachelor's degree to access a postgraduate master's degree.
Secondly, the Länder must ensure that there are enough places for today's generation of bachelor's students in master's programmes with the best possible conditions for studying tomorrow, said Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Board of Directors.
The states need to hire a lot more lecturers.
The Ministers of Culture, however, have not commented on the free access to master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Hertha Müller
Getting in and out of Germany is nice, almost no controls"... is the opening line of a poem by Werner Solner, who in this tongue-in-cheek piece deals with the experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children's book publishing house, then in 1982 he moved to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, lectured poetry at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt in 1993, and since 2002 has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A major non-literary stir was created last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the broken mirror of its security files".
Obviously confused and infected, Söllner left a statement to fellow Romanian-German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, admitting to cooperating as a secret informant for the Romanian Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
Recruitment attempts began in secret, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner continued, "someone who did not resist enough the attempts of intimidation by the Securitate".
The poet Werner Söllner is secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Hertha Müller and her unprecedented literary tackling of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that highlights the depths and shame of a political system based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is not only the perpetrator, at least as far as we know, but he is also the victim.
In the Securitate files, undercover agent Walter played a role, Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, referring to the positive influence undercover agent Walter had on him.
Markel says he "screwed" me up on every important point.
He has a moral obligation to make that remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in this form and to this audience, but it is not a completely surprising confession by a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller wrote back in July, when she read her own files, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant retreat for Securitate spies.
The touch, presumably, will speculate and in some cases even know which name is behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the domestic, now very certain, search of the Stazi files, the manipulation of the legacy of Securitate control is still very widespread.
In recent years, systematic education has been frustrated and limited.
One of the Birthler offices, the National Securities File Processing Council (CNSAS), was only established in 1999 and has been issuing files rather slowly since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the components.
That former members of the Securitate still have a strong influence in Romania was shown by an interview after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which one of the former heads of the Securitate from Temeșuar spoke negatively about the laureate.
She's psychotic, after all, she was only questioned once.
The humiliation of power is expressed here in the most open form of freedom of speech.
Of course, the Söllner case, as with the misdemeanor, raises inevitable questions.
The audience's strange reaction to Söllner's confession suggests that the continuation of this chapter will be driven more by a desire to know than by guilt and shame.
The genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
The full contribution of the Champions League
It looked like a clean-cut salesman coming from a cute Christmas party where he was handing out candy from a sports goods manufacturer when he got into a recalled C-Class Mercedes at 15 minutes past midnight with new VfBr coach Christian Gross and an orange sponsor bag.
The man with the prominent bald spot got a ride to a strange city for it.
Otherwise, he could drive alone - no alcohol was involved, and a 55-year-old man drunk with luck was also rare.
It's been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow we'll resume work.
Or it's just beginning.
The Swiss, who has only been in the competition for three days, said: "We have reached the quarter-finals" of the Champions League with a 3:1 win over Romania's Unirea Urziceni, "but we must not be dazzled by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against relegation".
"A far more important task" lies ahead of us on Sunday.
It's important to repeat the King class performance in the Mohucha on a regular league day.
And to avoid another obvious weakness after three quick goals by Marica (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyk (11).
Drawing of lots
The Champions League semi-finals (match 16/17 + 23/24 February/retaliation match 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be played on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's spectacular arrival will be preserved.
Not just the supposed healer who gave the insecure Stuttgart pros confidence, commitment and joy of the game in a short time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and I encouraged them to be brave, and soul healer Gross explained a recipe that sounded so simple and successful, but it didn't work under Babbel.
He was a kind of magic, admitted Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann, "when there's a new impetus in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't think possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injury, became the best player on the field with his dynamics, tried to describe the phenomenon he found with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the new supervisor's work practices: "He is a man who is radical and requires discipline.
That's what we need in this situation".
Babbel obviously missed it.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports president Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more consistency.
Like Gross, the players and managers don't want to overestimate the victory against a weakened reserve and completely overwhelmed Romanian guest defense.
They would have won in Glasgow before the awful wake-up call came after losing 4-0 at Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sporting president Horst Heldt reminded that while one goal has been achieved this season, the other is still a long way off.
We're not over the water yet.
Heldt's failure to celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win in three months was due to weekend events, which were brought to life in the form of a televised interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the match.
They are decisions that are made by others and not by Jens, Heldt said in response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He was criticizing the board for poor leadership and decided to change the coach under pressure from teenage fans.
Even the fact that he was stripped of his day off after the games, Lehmann called it a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's remarks "formulated pure selfishness", Heldt replied, announcing consequences for the goalkeepers.
Both men in their 40's will probably have no joy in life.
However, they agree with the others that without the work of the team's dismissed coaching staff, such a strong and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big part in the success", say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
The heavyweight championship match
The passionate duel in Bern: challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked with words and gestures the world champion Vitaly Klitschko.
However, after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his WBC heavyweight title.
The judges were unanimous.
Vitaly Klitschko remains the heavyweight boxing world champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat American Kevin Johnson by a unanimous score of 120:108, 120:108, 119:109 in Bern on Saturday night.
This is Klitschko's third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice World Champion of the WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't go as smoothly as everyone expected.
Klitschko improved his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice being defeated by injuries.
Challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th bout.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 6-foot-tall Klitschko led the fight primarily with his left hand.
Johnson, who was six inches shorter than Klitschko, announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, but he was backing away from the world champion's shot, so Klitschko could not deliver the decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
All in all, Johnson did very little for the challenger, just trying to get through to the next round.
Although Klitschko provoked with words and gestures, his punches rarely hit the world champion.
But still, he's only the second boxer since Timo Hoffmann in 2000 to fight Klitschko a full 12 rounds.
The challenger has arranged a riot in the Swiss capital before the match.
He insulted Klitschko as a "loathsome zombie" who "can't do anything right".
During Friday's weigh-in, the champion was provoked, pulling Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so he could see his eyes".
The fourth victory since Klitschko's return
Klitschko remained undefeated after his fourth match after his return on October 11, 2008.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he beat Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and regained "his" WBC belt, which he had previously surrendered without a fight.
He defeated defending champion Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and, in September, Chris Arreola of the United States.
I only got one shot in this fight and I'm in good physical shape, which justified Klitschko's quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the WBO and IBF world champion.
But the WBA belt is currently held by Brit David Haye, after he deposed the 2.13-meter-tall Nikolaj Vulayev in November.
Haye canceled a bout with Klitschko in the summer that was scheduled for September.
It's been reported that his promoter company is planning a fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Opposition frontal assault: Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar because of misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Left) are calling on the Chancellor to explain.
Hamburg/Berlin - The latest information on the Kunduz airstrike suggests that the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU), committed a deliberate deception.
The minister said "a deliberate lie" about the deadly September bombing of two tankers, Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin told ARD's "Tagesschau" news programme on Saturday.
Let's call it the usual term:
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That's the essence of the report that NATO had, that Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not just the destruction of the hijacked trucks, but the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The US airstrike, ordered by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, killed or wounded 142 people, according to a NATO investigation.
The Greens, SPD and Linke called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to immediately speak to the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Bundestag - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, urged Jürgen Trittin and her Green colleague Renate Künast.
The government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm has firmly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office has no influence over the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also strong doubts about the ministry's account of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both of them informed Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tankers.
Officially, it was supposed to deny the existence of NATO reports and withhold sensitive details from the secretary.
However, both top officials were reported to have even brought several reports to the attention of the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document by Commander Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reports that Wichert was in the meantime to ask for clarification in a letter.
It is noted that he has not received any reply so far.
The ministry did not comment on the criticism on Saturday and indicated that the matter would be dealt with in the Federal Assembly's investigative committee, which will be established next Wednesday.
The world of dreams
Some people see images and hear voices that others cannot see or hear.
It's not just the mentally ill or drug addicts who blur the lines between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in his sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we may surround ourselves with the wildest fantasies and fanciful delusions.
But in today's Western world, those who experience waking dream states, seeing and hearing things that others do not see and hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicts, or at least freaks.
However, such images and voices are not limited to the mentally ill or drug addicts.
It's our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels, here and there, blur the lines between dream, imagination, and reality.
Altered state of consciousness dreams can take many forms, at best we call them visions, at worst delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of New-Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of delusion, psychosis, and hallucination can all be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine - is upset and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions are very common in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him.
The connection between delusion and dream has intrigued philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of waking sleep, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 "the great similarity of hallucination to dream states", and for Sigmund Freud, sleep was even "psychosis, with all its nonsense, delusions, delusions of the senses".
It's the fall of 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and vividly colored.
Gravity has no power over it, it's hovering by the ceiling of the room.
He can feel the kick.
Behind him, winged devil figures with blood-red faces, appreciating teeth.
They chase him, kick him with their heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the wall, feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threatening from the walls and the radio.
He can't take the voices that insult and insult him anymore.
Henning T. pulls two wires out of the stereo, knots them into a loop, and then attaches it to a hook on the ceiling.
He'll stand on one of the speakers and put a loop around his neck.
He's going to jump.
The loop is letting go.
Learn, chorus voices screaming, ripping his drums, "go to the clinic and get treated!"
Henning T. is 40 years old today, has had six acute psychosis episodes, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
They were running LSD.
His diagnosis is paranoid schizophrenia, and he's also manic-depressive, taking antidepressants, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst of fear and the deepest of doubt, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
About 1 percent of people will develop schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime, and in psychiatric clinics, it's the second most commonly treated disorder after depression.
In acute schizophrenia, sufferers often can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, and they enter a state of hyperactivity that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, delusions of relationship, or delusions of being haunted.
Hearing voices - voices that command, comment, or conduct conversations - is especially prevalent.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The sufferer is unable to distinguish between the important and the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out distracting signals, the mind is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens up a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic of the University Hospital in Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has meaning for him.
At the same time, he becomes passive, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and unable to actively shape them.
As a result, schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is usually impossible for them, the ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is impossible.
To have a once in a lifetime hallucination
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchss, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that one perceives in psychosis remains essentially intact".
Delusions and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience takes place within the real framework.
Scientists are still puzzled as to why our brains are making these kinds of objects.
Exceptional conditions can cause anyone to lose touch with reality in the short term, says Fuchs.
But not everyone develops psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists assume that the affected individuals have minimal brain damage.
We think that early in development, the neural maturing brain may be damaged, for example, by a mother's viral illness during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But how the neural system is affected, and how it goes unnoticed for years, remains a mystery.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis, if any.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the circulatory system.
When our brains fail
The crazy thing is that psychotronic people suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others pay money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusions for a decade, and last year he interpreted his findings in a book, Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf.
Although hallucinations are a common symptom of psychosis, they are also a surprisingly common symptom of many other illnesses.
In addition to mental disorders like borderline personality or depression, there are often diseases like migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of a healthy person hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to Kastin, are composed of the contents of thoughts that are normally repressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain that process sensory perception are over-active or under-repressed; when our brain is shut down or when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal from stimulation, stress, anxiety about love, or any other extraordinary condition.
In recent studies, as many as one third of those surveyed reported experiencing hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends a high school there.
She's a perfectly normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the images and the voices.
At recess, she may be approached by a blonde with long, dark hair.
When she answers, her classmates look at her in amazement - no one but her sees or hears the boy.
This shy girl is considered a dreamer, but Sarah K. is not dreaming, she knows that.
He's awake, he hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and the other delusions are not real and he's going to disappear again.
At night, the visions are rather depressing.
Frequently, delusions are a burden.
When she sits in class, she cannot watch the classroom because the teacher is presenting the new student to her eyes and ears, while he explains the equation to everyone else, audibly and visibly, on the blackboard.
At night, the visions are rather depressing.
While waiting in her dark room for sleep, which rarely comes and too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or asleep, whether the images she sees, the faces, or the girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and feet, are appearing before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he's yelling at the characters.
She won't tell her friends or family, they'll think she's crazy.
It's the fall of 2009, Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted Kastena's psychologist online, she knows she's not crazy.
Delusions are also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or withdrawn from stimulation, they are more likely to hallucinate, Kasten says.
I think the brain has enough to do and is just taking care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when, at age 13, she learned that the man she'd called her dad since she was a toddler wasn't her real father.
Because visual and auditory hallucinations involve the same brain regions that process real-world sensations and sounds, it is difficult for those like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusion and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "is in the brain, and reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they seem so real".
Kasten also evaluates night dreams as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, sane people are able to identify their delusions as unreal.
So Kasten advises his patients to rate hallucinations as a special ability.
The borderline between dream and hallucination
In our world, too focused on the conscious, imaginary experience is unfortunately often pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a hard, excruciating disease, but it also brings positivity, creativity -- delusion is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard was studying what he called the oneiroid form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness to sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the subject believes to be real and cannot even retroactively distinguish them from the waking state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as patients with polyradicolitis who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
When a person is threatened with loss of the world and himself, perhaps by a permanent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
It's kind of a borderline state between a dream and a hallucination.
Because in reality, it's impossible to handle a situation, worlds change, but the real situation becomes present in the imagination.
An intensive form of sensory support and transference in some unbearable situation that allows us humans to shift our own capacity to shape into a moment of unconsciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memories
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Heart Exchange) as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old when, after heart valve surgery and a heart transplant, he went into a coma for several days, his body lying motionless in the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created, visits alien times and places: he becomes an old man confined to his bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among a noble family who makes drugs out of blood.
He's on a motorcycle, kidnapped by a Greek back home, surfing a surf shop in the Alps on a hospital bed, and meeting a Korean mobster.
He's completely immersed in an imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner pathways are fundamentally different to any dream for Claussen.
A dream is a different state, describing your experience.
Unlike dreams, memories of those mental journeys are still vividly vivid years later and in trivial detail.
Even brighter and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, one-childhood conditions, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug intoxication show how fragile our inner images of external reality can be even in a waking state.
Any change in consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality".
A fact that can also be enriching.

At 27 , the children are to take over the publishing house .
The new head of Kallen is a temporary solution: Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children in the long term, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will remain 100% family owned.
Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for the long term.
Both children will inherit at 27 and have a strong will to enter the business, says the 69-year-old man to SPIEGEL.
We've worked out the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is only asked afterwards.
I wonder if they have the skills.
You can't put your kids in charge of 7,500 employees if they're not capable enough.
It would kill the kids and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was stepping down as chairman of the board in January, and appointed his successor, Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of Burda's board of directors since 1999.
He was in charge of technology at first.
Later, with the Treasury, responsibility for company assets was added and, following the resignation of Jürgen Todenhofer, also direct marketing, foreign affairs, press and finance.
For the first time, no family member is running the publishing house.
The Burds' children are 19 and 17 years old, and their son Felix, who would be 42 today, died several years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to "couple 10, 15 years", Burda said.
The holding company should remain 100% family-owned in the future, says Burda.
Regarding the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not certain of going out of business: 'This has always happened to companies that have been infected by the desire for capital that they have speculated on and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power", says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play World League with Time, these deals are too big.

Christmas is coming up, and it's a good time to find out what celebrities are wearing and adjust your wardrobe accordingly.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which is something to keep in mind.
We're making a few suggestions.
Fergie the singer has chosen an extravagant and very complicated cut.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The energy company Endesa and the Barcelona City Council have set up a 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE office (Electric Vehicle Logistics) will set and manage the roadmap for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will ensure mobility agreements, arrange, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric vehicles, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the electric car project in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will also join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government under the MOVELE Plan to promote the introduction of electric vehicles.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan Government.
The objective is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes energy-related activities and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa in the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and is actively implementing a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE and CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'quiet period' for the car industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the country's main export sector, will face a 'quiet period'.
In the 2009 Economic Report of the Prime Minister, Zapatero summarised the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competition Plan for the automotive sector, we would be in a state of abandonment today, with some of our main manufacturing plants closing down", the Prime Minister said.
'Thanks to this plan and the desire of the individual brands to continue operating in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a period of calm is foreseen for the future for this industry, which is our main export sector,' he added.
In this respect, it noted that the Competition Plan, which forms part of the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (CAP), allocated 800 million to projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiaries, which mobilised investment in excess of EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and existing processes.
The Commission also noted that the aid was granted to the following companies:
According to the President, this plan has allowed an average emission reduction of 6% for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and has ensured a 'significant increase' in registrations, namely by '40%' in November.
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first International Classic Vehicle Show will open in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the motoring world.
The initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
The exhibition area covers 20 000 square metres and will be attended by more than 200 exhibitors from both the country and abroad.
Not only will you find classic motorcycles and cars, but at ClassicAuto Madrid you will also find all kinds of products related to the world of motorcycles.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc. The exhibition will be held in the premises of the exhibition centre.
Hundreds of classic motorcycle-related products, a real treat for collectors and curious.
The companies involved will be:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, refurbishment; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and refurbishment; or Cochera Clásicos, a company specialising in Mercedes Benz.
External proficiency tests
In addition, the commercial activities of the salon will be complemented by parallel activities: training sessions, sports performances, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Fitness tests for classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on an adapted circuit outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: keeping the sporty style
Mazda wants to show that being environmentally friendly doesn't have any negative impact on sportsmanship.
And that's why the Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop-and-start system - also called a stop-and-go - which is a device that's currently only available with a 2.0 150 horsepower petrol engine.
This second generation of the Mazda3 is characterised by the good characteristics it has achieved as a whole.
The surface, the vehicle design, the occupation, the behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects of the Mazda3 are excellent.
The front seats, including the driver's seat, are ergonomically excellent and are perfectly secured.
The steering wheel is also extremely smooth.
Using the toolkit and console, we conclude that Mazda is continuing the Japanese trend of developing futuristic design with many buttons and controllers and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style is partly reminiscent of the style that the Honda Civic also presents.
So we can say that the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and specifically even more with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this compact Japanese product provides more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, there is a large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
The automatic engine start/stop system is currently only available with a two-litre petrol engine with 150hp and a six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real delicacy, very gentle, low noise, high power and low fuel consumption.
Although the most popular Mazda3 is a diesel version, all those who do not drive that many kilometers a year should not rule out this petrol-powered i-Stop, as it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced consumption.
As for the equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of standard elements.
The standard equipment includes a lane monitoring system (RVM) to prevent blind spots, thrust and stability control, speed control, a light-sensitive interior mirror, a large-screen on-board computer, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped with a Pack Premium, for an extra €1,500: adaptive two-xenon lights and a BOSE sound system with a CD holder, among other components.
The Commission
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its class.
It is characterised in particular by the quality of the materials used, its operation and the high level of equipment.
And, in addition, people who don't drive more miles a year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is just a 2.0 petrol engine and 150 horsepower.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is EUR 21.770 for the Luxury version and EUR 23.270 for the tested version -Sport.
For this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
The luxury 'Premiere'
L.A. has a red carpet, as soft as Penelope Cruz's hands, Nicole Kidman's and Fergie's.
Stars were shining more than ever in the elegant and sexy new models of the 'Nine' brand.
Our Pe, extravagant as usual, has chosen the dark ladies.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, only used to browse mail, with no option to browse certain types of attachments or surf the web.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of its products of the year.
It's harder to see it out there, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, the Peek is very low priced and has monthly payments, less than half of what you pay for an iPhone data plan, for example.
Following its success, the company began offering two new devices: one dedicated exclusively to Twitter, the other based on a continuously provided free data service, but requiring a six-fold fee for Peek.
The FonPeek, which was unveiled yesterday at Le Web, is the European version of the invention and also its third variation.
It's as limited as its American counterpart, but it does bring surprises.
The monthly maintenance fee is around EUR 12 per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People travelling with smartphones already know what it's like to lose data services when crossing borders or to be impatient to find a cafe with WiFi (or Fon connection) to check their mail.
The idea of a fixed-price rooming is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, you'd need a Ph.D. in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read the miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly calling for roaming tariffs to be reduced to be accessible to all Europeans, which is still not having the desired effect.
There are legitimate concerns about the use of data services outside the home country.
The fact that a device such as the FonPeek (which, interestingly, still goes by the name Fon even without WiFi) achieves this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and consider different offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other Internet searches.
No contracts, no complications, you know?
This device is connected and paid for when purchased, not monthly.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen with FonPeek one day, which is a permanent access purchase option like Peek already has in the US.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm checking my e-mail on my phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it's the best kind from a consumer perspective.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in a computer.
The color that Michelle loves.
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
She chose this color for Barack Obama's inauguration as president of the United States, and the same color she chose when she accompanied him to the second most important moment in his life: the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with sparkling effects - in both cases, it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a coat made of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States had decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The material of the garments makes both models very different.
When Michelle took office, she used a large lace, a velvet print in Oslo.
He also changes his accessories: green shoes with medium heels, a similar model but in gold.
He also wears different hairstyles: this time, a curly one, previously loose.
75% of working mothers have work-related problems with their childbearing.
Employment discrimination has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who are planning to have a child.
This is the result of a study 'Fertility and working careers of Spanish women' carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market because of motherhood.
The study highlights that at the beginning of cohabitation, there are many differences in views on the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with their partner earlier, have their first child earlier and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable jobs, especially in the public sector, put off cohabitation and motherhood and have fewer children.
"Women aged 35-49 with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years after they start living with their partner.This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted most of their lives to achieving their stable job and have therefore had to postpone their partnership and the birth of their children.
The type of occupation also has a strong influence on motherhood, albeit less on the length of time spent living with a partner", explains Margarita Delgado, a researcher at the CSIC.
Another factor that affects the age of women at the time of marriage and the birth of their offspring is their level of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which women marry and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, women with primary and tertiary education had their first child at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with a basic education marry and have their first child before they find a stable job, while women with a secondary or tertiary education, on the other hand, prefer to get a stable job before they marry and have their first child", says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of executives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the face of the brand's various products under the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it'.
The 'Joyeux Noël' star, one of the most elegant actresses of international standing, joins other celebrities from L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Cottage Millionaire") had joined this exclusive club.
The men's side of the cosmetics brand is also represented by notable personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'The Lost').
Prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, past and present - gathered for the annual awards ceremony, which took place in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was missing from the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted Model of the Year.
The poker of Manuel Vicente
Manuel Vicent donates in 'Aces Poker' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) thirty X-rays of writers he has met in his literary life (and in some cases in his everyday life).
He does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey is exciting, and Vincent is not without adventure and inspiration.
This book is a delightful read, even when read repeatedly.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: "In the pages of this book I discovered that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but cannot be named: the pleasure of the contrary, a morality without guilt and innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "The nihilist, the allegorical Christian, wrote from his own nature and not from the intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with a blindingly poetic humour, without meaning, as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him".
About Graham Green: "Our man was obsessed with this woman for thirteen years, with all the pleasure, pleasure and regret that is the spiritual privilege of reaching heaven by way of damnation".
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey, published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, is one of the eight thousand peaks in universal literature to be climbed from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall".
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
About himself, he said he was the heir to the county landlord, sometimes he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a big dream".
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer has captured on the bridge the mad cry of this man from Munich, to carry its echo into the night of the 20th century in its literary form, running from himself and calling to the future and speaking fiercely to the worms".
About Dorothy Parker: "Once she knelt down and prayed, 'God, my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman.'
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved Spenser's verses: 'After toil comes a dream, / after a storm a calm harbor, / after a war rest, / after a full life death".
About Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his luggage.
Her husband was perfectly content to hear her tell him that Edward VII was following her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing Greek.
Never before has a man been so patient and so in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness".
On Pío Barrojo: "What else did Martín Santos want to do but target Joyce on Barrojo?
What else did Benet want than to have Barjo execute him with Faulkner's gun?
What was it about Cel, other than making himself famous at the expense of that man's fame?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada County, and a group of young people, ages 15 to 18, passed by the roadside and our dog, a 6-pound crossbred rescued from the shelter, was kicked twice without a word and seriously injured.
Our outrage is all the greater that we see nothing amusing in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was on a leash.
And to add to that the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she came across these individuals on a walk, she also became worried about her own safety, because such a demon-possessed person who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old person or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at 5:00 p.m. on a Tuesday in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
We have, of course, lodged a complaint with the nearest police station, but we doubt it was for anything, and to avoid raising sensitive questions, we find that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
Outrage has compelled us to announce this fact.
We don't understand what's happening to today's youth when they enjoy tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We don't understand what happened to proper manners, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly for wearing helmets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorists, as both bodies have reported today.
The aim of this initiative is to highlight the importance of wearing a helmet as it is the only way to prevent head injuries and possibly deaths in motorcycle accidents.
Michelin states that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which 'means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products', and confirms that it is also trying to achieve this objective in another way, namely through an education and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase in which more than 500 repaired motorcycles will be given signs to raise awareness among the general public.
The Commission also noted that the Commission had not provided any information on the level of the injury elimination level.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represented an increase of 12,6% compared to 2008 and, moreover, the first increase after 22 months of steady decline, according to figures from the patronage organisation of manufacturers Anfac and dealers Ganvam.
However, a positive figure is better to put in quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and represented a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% lower than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling within the category of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small trucks and light trucks/chassis.
And the clouds that are most damaging to demand, even if they are bought by private individuals, have not disappeared, most of the purchases are made by SMEs and almost 100% of the cases are financed through third parties.
In addition to the restrictions resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans, other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation should be added.
In this situation, unlike for passenger cars, the aid for the purchase of 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is worth mentioning the number of small and medium-sized businesses that are interested in buying a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with CO2 emissions of less than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam again reminded us that special attention needs to be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers' association expects 2010 to be similar to last year and sales of passenger cars and 4x4s to fall by 19%, according to the calculations.
The manual brake assist system is already mandatory equipment.
As with the anti-lock system, ABS, ESP, and the manual brake systems will be mandatory on European cars.
In fact, it is already part of the compulsory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the deadline for the removal of the deficiency for the others is set at February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU are designed to increase pedestrian protection, and they work by helping to prevent many collisions.
The manual brake assist system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which is detected by the system after the driver steps.
But he can't always keep up the pressure.
According to a study by the automotive parts company Bosch, one third of drivers who are involved in an accident did not apply the brake before the collision, and half of them did not use the brake force to its full potential.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this aid requires the braking system to perform its maximum braking performance, reducing the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related fatalities could be avoided each year.
The reduction in this number will be even more marked - one in four accidents involving persons would be prevented, according to calculations - once so-called intelligent handbrake systems are introduced.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system that (by radar or camera) detects obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the collision cannot be avoided, the device shall apply the brake as much as possible and minimise the risk of damage.
General Motors is delaying the Opel plan until January.
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably April 8 - as informed by Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer points out that it will take more time to meet the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to get every point of the plan agreed with the party involved first.
As a result, the final document, which will be submitted first to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries where the production facilities are located, may be issued late in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, claims that the decision to sell Saab should be taken within the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM is making contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also wants to acquire Volvo but is considering the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the umbrella of the Russian Converg group.
If no agreement can be reached with either of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if the sale fails, remains in force.
Riding with a Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, thus showing a weight of only 1,275 kg.
The first was the automatic retractable roof in a hand-held fabric design, which reduced weight by 21 kg; the second was the use of aluminium doors such as the GT3, which reduced weight by 15 kg; the removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a further 7 kg reduction in weight; the second was the installation of sports seats, which reduced weight by 12 kg, and the lightened 19 kg of the rack.
And finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
Also offered with a PDK dual-clutch transmission, one vehicle with a six-speed manual gearbox was tested, mainly on California second-class roads, on mountain sections with many twisty corners.
His behavior can only be qualified as untouchable.
Reducing weight does not mean that the vehicle will not hit the asphalt.
Quite the contrary: we haven't tested a model that small and light for a long time, yet that delivers such cornering safety, even at high speeds.
He's a small athlete capable of warming up his muscles on a short ride for as long as it takes until we order him to sprint, brake, and resume motor use...
With steering that's as communicative as it is precise, whatever you signal with your hands on the wheel is what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The 320 hp V6 boxer sound (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced by the 'sport' option and by a system that modifies the engine sound that was previously used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether it's suction or recovery.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we drive on with the Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the cracks well.
Electronic assistance was almost unnecessary during the ride, and in some corners we encountered frost and gravel even in the early morning.
This ultralight car is definitely one of the most entertaining on the market, because it's more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be launched in February 2010 at a price of EUR70,831.

Basconia wins in Israel
The Labour treasurer won a brilliant 82-91 victory at her home on the complicated Maccabi Electra course, despite numerous absences from Dusko Ivanovic's team, and thus came to the front of her group after a great performance by Mirza Teletovic, who was voted best in the team with eight triple points (29 ratings).
The Vitoria team managed to make up for the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mice with a great deal of dedication and collective work, although they had to suffer to the end to win.
In addition, the high accuracy of the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The game started with a front for the blue, who stood by the mark from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance already indicated that they attacked the Israeli cooperative very hard.
English and Teletovic were leading 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alawite team opted for the inside play of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was greeted with whistling and applause on his return to his original position to increase the advantage before the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already showing himself to be the best in his team with 13 points, although 'no six' in Splitter's rating already indicated that it would not be the best night for the Brazilian.
But even though the match was fierce until half-time, it was not decided in the least, and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vittoria that not everyone wins on their pitch, and with the 'hand of Elias' they could win.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to the return of the 'yellow' to the sunrise (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, injured but not dead at all, needed a few precise plays to catch their breath, and then appeared the machine gun of Mirz Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the help of Englisch and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring score (54-67), which the locals achieved at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavés have been outplayed in the last half and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced they will not let anyone take away their well-deserved first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter eliminated for a foul, the Selvanovic team was slow and defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the final minute (80-85), the match was already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
The wounds are making it impossible for the Unicaja to fight.
Unicaja suffered a significant defeat in Greece to Olympiacos, giving them the lead of Euroleague Group B in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but mainly an inside game ((Freeland, Lima and Archibald) which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not intimidated by the atmosphere of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship or by a rival, perhaps one of the sickest in Europe, and with a big budget.
The first quarter's play allowed the Andalusians to dream, and an aggressive defense and three consecutive triple-doubles, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillaume Rubia, brightened the field with a 12-18 lead in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the home arsenal in an in-house game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis turned the score 22-20, 13 minutes, which was the moment when the battle between the USA backs Beverley and Williams meant the elimination of both players.
The Greek team started to work and proved its superiority in both zones where the absence of the English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jimenez burdened the Unicaja team
Between the inside players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas with the triple points, they increased the lead to 44-32, 19 minutes.
Impossible to retaliate
The third half was very attacking from Olympiacos, who, despite losing by 19, showed the upper hand and even managed to even the gap from the match in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absence and final absence of Scottish centre Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the odds, Unicaja's lead and Cook's triple-point effort and Lewis' contribution left a solid shot at a 66-57 win in the 31st minute.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, with its strength and inches of advantage in their zone, proved that it was unstoppable.
Croatian center Nikola Vujcic, was able to tie the basketball average 81-62, 37 minutes, and Unicaja folded and handed the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get a look at the salary they deserve for their profile thanks to the new Trovit app, the search engine with the highest number of classified ads for real estate, jobs and motor vehicles in Spain.
The How Much Should You Earn? tool calculates users' salaries based on the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, which requires the insertion of a profession, years of experience, age and the city where the candidate wishes to work.
Within a week of the app's launch, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally "feels underpaid", explained Albert Rivera, responsible for the Trovit product, in his report.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the lowest paid.
A British programmer earns 45,226 euros gross per year, a Frenchman 31,059, while a Spanish earns 24,000.
Similarly, a driver has a net annual salary of €34,247 in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is a waiter with a net annual income of 11,592 euros, followed by a salesman with 14,725 euros and a laborer with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker.
Brazil has set a date for Zelay's departure
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires at the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy by that date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27th, when his term ends, he must leave and seek other refuge".
The station also quoted a former diplomat who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government", Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to seek asylum in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed because Zelaya refused the political asylum condition sought by the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has re-emerged in the markets, which should not be surprising, as it is already a natural state in an environment where traders make decisions about the future that is itself uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise the market was to monetize debt by directly buying assets and indirectly release liquidity at close to zero rates so that financial institutions could buy assets for deduction.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are virtually over and, without questioning their incoherent liquidity policies, they are starting to throw some sand in the bucket, as did the Bank of Spain with its auction last year.
Investors are thus questioning the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a return to reduced risk returns.
The volatility of the stock market and corporate bond spreads have regained their points, although they are still far from the abnormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialise private risk, which again affected public debt.
The focus is on quality again, and the US, Japan and Germany have become the safe havens of choice for investors, thus widening the differentiation of the euro area countries from Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened to revise the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useless to silence moral hazard advocates who have tried to re-burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy to curb the devastating effects of the credit cut on employment when in fact a new Thanksgiving should be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between the emirates to restore power in the emirate, and in the case of Greece, we have seen this before.
A government that covers the deficit, elections and a new government takes office.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barros.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to bail out Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro area member country to default on its obligations.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin will force the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens to commit to collective responsibility when extraordinary measures are needed to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of the normalisation period for transitional risk premiums, after some excesses on the supported positions, they would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt gaps will widen as will European corporate bonds, we need not worry.
If European disparities narrow and ours continue to widen, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's affair is just an anecdote, and when our leading indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 upside scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not bode well for the Spanish economy to live to see this warning.
Once again, it looks like this will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now, "be careful, fellow driver".

Ignacio Sánchez Galán, President of Iberdrola, was the first to speak yesterday before the House of Representatives' subcommittee, where the Spanish energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed.
Following his intervention, which was followed by the speech by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán made a number of comments to the press on the proposal he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the measure is compatible with the internal market.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion but up to 95 billion.
Iberdrola considers that the investments in the next decade must not be directed towards increasing production capacity but towards distribution networks and international connections.
From 2020 onwards, the question changes and more power will be needed.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal plants with carbon capture mechanisms and in particular on renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that a further 18,000 MW are needed, but with other 'assistive energies'.
Galán, who believes the draft law on sustainable economy that the government has just approved, is in line with the line the company has been demanding, did not want to go as far as a royal decree to promote national coal consumption, which is contrary to the policies to fight climate change.
In his view, the 'clear long-term stake' in this respect is despite the 'precise' measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
In any event, Galán considers that investment decisions, although long-term, must be made now, as they are still in the process of maturation and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial won handling from Aer Lingus at 10 airports
The airport ground services subsidiary of Ferrovial, Swissport, will act as the preferred partner of Irish airlines Aer Lingus for freight services at the 10 European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet expired, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a cooperation protocol to create a Centre for Innovation in Intelligent Infrastructures
The association envisages an investment of EUR 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will be for Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to research energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first motorway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession in Australia, a market where it already operates as an energy and water company.
The tunnel is estimated to cost A$1.7 billion.
Its competitors are the French firm Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5 km tunnel in Brisbane, Australia, on the east coast, became the closest option for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction and concession highway company.
The City Council wants the tunnel completed by the end of 2014
Following the selection of the public-private partnership (PPP) for the further development of the project in the business plan of Erns & Young, the administration has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the toll.
The tenders are expected to be submitted in May, with an investment of A$1.7 billion (EUR1.047 billion) and a final phase of competition between three groups with a significant presence in European construction.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies and the other, based in Italy, is one of Europe's largest underground specialists.
The Northern Direct Group, with the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues, is competing against Acciona.
The third and final group to be covered by the network is LBRJV, which is owned by the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), also by local Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and by the major civil engineering firm Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction and privatisation, but it clearly presents a difficulty to enter other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger, in addition to the Asian references, is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Assets in millions
Acciona is focusing on the geographical area of greatest importance for the sector in question, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supply and desalination business.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm at Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that build and operate a $700 million desalination plant in Adelaide.
The Commission now plans to consolidate these two areas and use the combined energy to enter the infrastructure construction and operation sectors.
A toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Authority, called the Northern Link, is to connect the Toowong Western Expressway to the Kelvin Grove ring road (see map) through a 5 kilometre tunnel, the largest ever undertaken to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the local administration is for the start of construction in the summer of 2010 and the start of work in December of next year.
The Commission notes that the project was not completed until the end of 2014.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will contain two streams in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide A$500 million (€308 million) to fund it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief.
Australia continues to bring Hochtief a significant profit as it announced a deal with the government yesterday estimated at $154 million.
The ACS shareholder will operate the infrastructure of the national fibre-optic broadband network through its local Leighton subsidiary.
This situation will provide fast Internet access for 400,000 people and provide employment for a German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the 27-story King George Tower in Brisbane, Australia, just before construction began, and Hochtief closed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, it will be involved with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres over a period of 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
The FCC was awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the aid is compatible with the internal market.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after the completion of the 130 million tunnel extension in Bosruck, Austria.
In this way, Alpine is strengthening its tunnel building expertise.
The work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and the implementation period is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got a commercial at Renfe.
Renfe has contracted advertising and marketing services for the last two years to Mrs Rushmore's agency for an annual amount of approximately EUR 3 million, the railway company said.
The contract includes an option to renew for 12 months each year. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that had submitted in a competition held by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA, which had been responsible for creating the advertisements for the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
Fine of 63 million for France Télécom for the restriction of competition
France's competition regulator has fined France Télécom EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in its Caribbean region.
According to the institution, the operator has restricted competition from fixed and mobile telephones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes with consumers on the fringes of regulation.
The former French monopoly and still state-owned company has been fined more than €560 million since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the Competition Authority considers that France Télécom committed a similar infringement to the one in the past and that it has therefore re-offended.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company's mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened an online application store to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the outset, the Orange app business will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries such as Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since the beginning
The Champions League has been a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
The Commission notes that the Spanish authorities have not provided any information on the amount of aid received by the Spanish authorities.
The charter is run by Manchester United.
The charter is run by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a glory, it's also a major source of income for big clubs.
The competition has distributed EUR 5,362.5 million among 105 clubs (12 of them Spanish) which have participated since the tournament's inception in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have come out of this division very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money raised for participation, and the only one along with AC Milan to win the grand prix three times.
The Catalan reigning champion and the last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992 is fifth in the standings.
Manchester United and Bayern Munich are leading the list, the two clubs that also charged the most money for participation in the last Champions League.
And that's despite losing both to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country to have received the most money through Champions despite winning the most titles of all (five to four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the body, chaired by Michel Platini, plans to make €1.090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA allocates 413,1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the preliminary qualifying round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2,1 million.
In addition, those who had reached the final were paid 3.8 million euros for their attendance alone, plus an additional 550,000 euros for each match they took part in.
There are also prize money for winning (800,000 euros) and drawing (400,000 for each team), with the eight semi-finalists each receiving three million; the eight quarter-finalists 3.3 million.
The last four will each get $4 million.
The champion will win $9 million, while the runner-up will win $5.2 million.
This will give the club a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça earned 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, however, there are variable payments, for which 337.8 million is earmarked.
This money is divided by the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones and has four places assigned.
Last year's champion gets 40% of the allotted money, second 30%, third 20% and fourth 10%.
The second half will be paid according to the number of matches that take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa is offering 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday published the details of its share buy-out offering to acquire a top spot between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage shall not be binding on the public to make an offer to buy (option) all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, which it would pay over 10 years and for which it would pay interest on this deferral of 1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos shares closed at EUR 1.85; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumas values the company 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumas, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the board.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
The CNMV stated that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611,7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254,27 million.
Meanwhile, the Sos continues to change the structure of its leadership.
In an attempt to stay on the sidelines of potential buyout offers and to offset the legal wrangling between its former leaders, brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, the election of María Luisa Jordan as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in a food company.
This is a newly created position reporting directly to the group president.
And it's not without controversy, as the company continues to be mired in a legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than $230 million from the SOS by Salazar brothers' companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that the SOS will uncover new fund transfers in the coming months.
As for the Salazar credit, yesterday, former council members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega testified before the National Court, confirming that they approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing where they were going.
The CNMV authorises the option to exclude Paternina, which was participated in by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion of Federico Paternini, in which Inversora Mer participates, on October 9th.
The Authority explained that it authorised the operation as it understood that its conditions were in line with the applicable standards and considered that the content of the explanatory leaflets submitted following the amendments introduced on 2 December was 'sufficient'.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is for the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federica Paternina at a price of EUR 7,65 per share, representing 8,95% of the company's capital, which consists of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5.592.778 million shares had been immobilized, which could not be transferred in any way until the offer was closed, specifying that the price had been set by Federic Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New tools for pricing cars
These days, storms and accidents don't just make a profit for auto repair shops.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance accident are taken to a repair shop, where an expert must estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and calculating the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complex job.
Manually calculating the repair costs of 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, can take two or three hours.
However, with the help of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That's why almost 100% of the experts use this kind of system.
Providers of services and solutions for the estimation of incidents and maintenance shall collect the information provided by manufacturers in order to develop and offer a useful tool to their customers.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the US Solera group, is the leading company; 80% of the evaluations are carried out with its products.
Other competitors in the field of valuation tools and sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex's commercial director, they work with 63 producers and importers in Spain and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
It is a very hectic job because you have to catalogue each of the thousands of parts in the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, 'intelligent' graphics processing is carried out on each model, where it is possible to 'pick out' individual parts of the coaches.
For a mass-market model, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
For a minority car, it can take three or four months.
The most exclusive models they have information on include Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
In terms of fleet, they exceed 99%.
Audatex has eight centres around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) for documentation and database development, each specialising in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million a year in the development of these databases.
2.5 million data items are entered every month and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this huge flow of information enables companies to make different uses and offer different products.
The most common use is in repair and maintenance, but according to the country, there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the selling or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that gives information on the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but they do in the United States.
Given the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to obtain support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
The company offers ten different tools, with AudaPlus, the standard event valuation solution for experts, as its flagship product.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the paint shop.
This tool shall be applied on a case-by-case basis for each assessment.
The maximum price is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it only a few times, up to ten times a month.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates their price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line, based only on the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service for the professional sector on the internet that allows the disposal of vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, for geodemographic analyses or for detecting deviations by brand or model.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a particular brand have been serviced due to an accident or how many have suffered serious insurance events over a period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group established in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, accidents or maintenance of motor vehicles
The Guía's valuation is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in service, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Turnover has increased by 20% per year over the last three years and in 2008 they accounted for EUR 10,8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization began with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources, 62% of her brother's income comes from Europe and 38% from North and South America.
The Solera Group's worldwide turnover (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach USD 557 million, which is 3,3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will earn 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock market, and now its shares are estimated to be worth a total of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auctioning of crashed vehicles
In October last year, the Solera Group acquired Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance incident.
The operation provided for the subscription of EUR 59.5 million of 85% of the company's capital, which could be increased by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and buying and selling service is exclusively for professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, service companies, spare parts sales and professional dealers who must register before starting operations.
The platform was set up in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
The main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site currently has over 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car with a number plate that has been discontinued cannot be put back into service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles of historical value may be allowed to operate, even if they have been decommissioned, after preliminary driving.
The four-step service budget
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user obtains the budget in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for a spare part, budget creation and budget generation.
The ease of use is a key condition for these systems, especially for the persuasion of older professionals who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, of which 666 are tourist, 109 are off-road, 137 are motorcycles, 78 are vans and 44 are trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an Internet connection to use it.
After identifying the model to be repaired by means of the chassis number, a realistic graphical representation of the model is displayed and the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour costs, surcharges or discounts, and then print them out and hand them to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a pricing tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not involve a labour force estimate.
The costs of using this tool for the workshop are EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
Audatex is currently working on making this image three dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome because it allows, for example, to pick a door and turn it to show the inside.
