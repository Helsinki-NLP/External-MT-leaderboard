Republican strategy to resist reelection of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that election fraud is less common in the United States than death by lightning.
And Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in the last decade.
One thing is for sure: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In that sense, this kind of action is partly discrediting the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That's why most state governments have passed laws since 2009 that make it harder to register or vote.
This phenomenon gained new momentum after the November 2010 election, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills restricting voting rights were passed in 41 states.
New election laws require voters to show photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register on the day of the vote and deprive citizens with criminal records of the right to vote.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present photo IDs.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a law passed in Indiana in 2008.
Republican officials quickly expanded the practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they've introduced bills requiring voters to show photo IDs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, or 21 million people over the voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by their state's government agency.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
The cost of obtaining the required ID card is often over $100.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 percent of African Americans, 15 percent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 percent of citizens over age 65, and 20 percent of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Student voters who are believed to be voting for Democratic candidates are banned in several states from using photo IDs issued by their school.
But these same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, which vote mostly for Republicans, to use ballot papers issued by those clubs.
Until 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
This requirement was first introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of Latin Americans.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote for the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated legislation in 2011 to abolish voter registration on Election Day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This restriction did not go unchecked.
For example, during the 2004 election, a campaign to register voters helped to register some 10 million people.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the level of new voter registration in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of early voters were African-American, although the latter made up only 13% of the state's total voters.
The same thing happened with the Latin Americans.
While they represented only 11% of the electorate, they made up 24% of the citizens who voted early.
Unlike whites, who make up 76 percent of the electorate, only 46 percent of early voters cast ballots.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters are actively opposed to passing laws that restrict voter registration.
Several bills have been vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended by the United States Attorney General.
This partially reduced the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring photo ID.
However, the new rules that have come into force will certainly make it harder to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics of the legislation, who see it as clearly intended to influence the outcome of the 2012 election in key states, have condemned the bias of the legislation.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In that sense, this kind of action is partly discrediting the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: should I take the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives false-negative and sometimes false-positive results that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men who are reluctant to go to rehab have even more reason to be suspicious.
Do you want to take the test or not?
We asked two experts.
Studies in the United States have shown that many cases of infection occur among groups of people, so the data are difficult to interpret and make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, found different death rates for those who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of follow-up, that the chance of metastasis was 30-40% higher in those who had not been screened.
So, I would recommend getting tested starting at age 50, or 40, if you have a direct relative with prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and slow-growing.
The patient needs to be made aware of the risk of their cancer, offering them options, not necessarily a treatment for prostate cancer that is not life threatening in the long run, but choosing, in these cases, to have active surveillance.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and not life-threatening.
We'll offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we'll start treatment.
Increasingly, we are defining criteria for making decisions about who should or should not undergo treatment.
So I would recommend that you take the test.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether you should have this test.
In collaboration with the International Urological Association, Movember has developed a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of taking a PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in scientific research, a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and exercised enough, 30 percent of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, the number would rise to at least 50 percent", says André Bolier, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that 10 percent of cancers are hereditary.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
The Canadian Cancer Society continues to make smoking a priority, even though the number of smokers is declining.
Smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancers.
And it's a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous harm to people's health.
"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", says press secretary André Bolier.
And the encouraging fact is that 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer is cut in half.
Weight
According to the CDC, overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon, rectal, esophageal, pancreatic, and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer", adds the association.
Food and nutrition
The association also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
In too high a concentration, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer", explains the association.
Vitamins and minerals
In recent years, many scientists have studied the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer.
But at this point, the results of these studies are not conclusive.
The SCC says vitamin E research has produced conflicting results.
If one of them showed a decreased risk of prostate cancer, the other one showed the opposite.
The effects of vitamin D on cancer development are also unclear.
However, Mr. Pain stresses that it's important to discuss your anxiety and family history with your doctor.
"Passing the test doesn't lead to cancer".
The Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, the news that scientists may have discovered the Higgs boson caused quite a stir - and for good reason.
This boson is thought to explain the mass of all the particles in the universe, no less.
It's also the last particle predicted by the Standard Model -- our best, or at least least least least imperfect, description of the nature and behavior of matter -- but never before detected experimentally.
But physicists are not sure that this is the Higgs boson.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we're dealing with a really new particle and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Also, new data presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seems to support this, although some data are not yet available for full certainty.
But let's say we're talking about the Higgs boson, because the chances of getting it wrong seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is one law in this world that is completely unavoidable, which is that no two things can be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way around this rule, even if you try too hard, or you will hurt yourself.
But while particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this nature: the Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same moment in time if they are in the same quantum state -- that state is, in general, some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens called fermions who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
The other is a bunch of bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything -- at least this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
According to the (by the way, quite unusual) Particle Adventure website of Berkeley Laboratories, these bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we won't talk about here, and "force particles", which are the primary forces of nature and to which the Higgs boson belongs in some way.
These bosons themselves, it should be emphasized, are not all as exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's because of one incredibly common boson: the photon, or "particle of light", which is the "courier" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a single particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in that particular location, much like a rock thrown into a pond.
From this "violation" arises an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons of the "force carriers".
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, has to be broken.
But the Higgs field is much, much more stable than an electromagnetic field; it needs to reach very, very high energies to be excited, like a frozen pond, the surface of which can only be shaken by a very large rock.
That's why you need a huge particle accelerator like the one that's running at CERN -- the Large Hadron Collider, which is a 17-mile-diameter ring! -- to achieve these enormous energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with an electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, while others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never hold on a refrigerator by itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like the photon, by the way) do not.
So what "can" all this research bring, asks Plamondon?
In science, they are used to test the accuracy of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to feel the discrepancy between the results of observations and the predictions of the SM.
And some of them are desperate to see that discrepancy revealed, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door to a new physics and plug some of the Model holes.
The latter, I must say, still has significant flaws, offering no explanation for gravity (wow!) or for dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe (wow!).
But so far, CERN has not found any such discrepancies.
The Consequences
The benefits of these studies for the average person's daily life are harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that they don't.
Look, in the early '60s, the pioneers of laser research at Bell Labs couldn't have even imagined the revolution their work would cause.
They saw their applications in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, said that initially the laser was considered more like a "laboratory gadget".
Can you imagine?
And then there's the application for the tools that go with the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle, during his optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, though not at all its original purpose, now serves as the eye for all the world's digital cameras and won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This doesn't mean, of course, that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that anything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die...
The Quebec Commission for the Decency of Death recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume soon, and a bill is being drafted.
However, much remains to be done in this vital area.
"Due" tried to take a closer look.
Only a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monteregio.
Prostate cancer, which was destroying him from the inside, gave him a two-year reprieve.
"I was given five years, I lived seven", he says, between life and death, lying in bed at the Victor-Hadboua hospice in Belley, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, and you can't prepare for it", he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet or even eating on your own.
Sitting at a table with a tasty meal, he gives in and accepts help to assimilate his food.
He's cheerful, even able to smile, to talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
Courage in the face of a normal death.
"My greatest desire is to be cured of diarrhea", he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"We are taught all our lives that a man should urinate standing up", says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the Victor-Hadboua shelter.
To regress to the condition of a child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
"It all depends on the person's ability" to cope with decline, he says.
Because, according to many palliative care practitioners, major events happen at the height of this decline.
The patients who come to Victor Hadboe's hospice are all cancer patients.
The prognosis is three months to life at most.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses no longer provide the care called "medication".
Mrs. A., 89, has a fear of dying "conscious of suffocation".
But the illness allowed me to get to know my children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life", she says before being allowed to wear a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting for the last visit of her son, who came from Italy.
The Victor-Hadboua shelter provides care and nutrition with the help of a group of volunteers.
This is palliative care, which is left over when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one place in a palliative care facility for every 11,700 people.
That's not much considering we all die sooner or later.
Life here continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at the shelter.
Whether it's physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
We'll give a dying man a mouthwash of brandy or Pepsi, whatever he asks for.
We don't make diabetics control their blood sugar anymore.
And death is part of the everyday.
Last night we brought beer to Mr. H, who died tonight.
His son finished this beer at the dead man's feet this morning.
"We help the family as well as the patients", says Natalie Savar, director of patient care.
At the Victor-Hadbou shelter, no day is the same as the last.
Next to a 93-year-old man enjoying his last meeting with his family in the yard, reclining on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children and having tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, three to five beds have been occupied by cancer patients under 45", worries Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Hadbou shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering their final stages of life, whether at home, in a hospital, or in a nursing home.
And some institutions, like the Victor Hadbou Shelter and the Palliative Care Home Society of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is this gap in Quebec's health care system that has many palliative care doctors worried about legislation legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating from the world's leading palliative care practitioners, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapaunt, expressing their disapproval of the initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health care system is not efficient enough to provide the right to high-quality palliative care before euthanasia is allowed.
She says, "I recently saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in excruciating pain, and no one took the necessary steps to relieve her.
I'm afraid the only reason patients want to die is because they're not getting adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists are working to the end to save their patients despite pessimistic forecasts.
Helen Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she stopped the grueling chemo.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping my treatment, she said that she regretted stopping the fight", she says.
She told me that my days were numbered!
There is no cure
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of patients who ask to die thank the health care staff for not granting their request after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
However, palliative care is not an all-powerful pain reliever.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients are not responsive to pain medication in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, where the patient is put to sleep until the moment of death, either intermittently or permanently.
We can no longer pretend that we don't know about this suffering.
More and more patients who cannot relieve pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
Patients who suffer from pain always say the same phrase: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be euthanized", it means "I want to feel better".
This story was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandal in Quebec
Day after day, officials in charge of road construction, construction contractors, political party fundraisers, and Italian mafia experts share what they know about the colossal "system" that envelops the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists, and mafiosi.
An industry that has been very costly to the Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how this system crumbles after all the resources have been put into it", jokes Jacques Duchesne, a deputy and former Montreal police chief.
It was he who in 2011 sparked a scandal as a byproduct of an investigation into official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Chare, reluctantly agreed to.
The Duchesne Report established a direct link between industry, covert funding of political parties and corruption.
"Since the inquiry began in 2010, he points out, the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts" if some had held back their instincts to take a share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already removed two mayors", he adds, hoping to "uncover the schemes behind individuals".
Permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The case was joined by the Permanent Corruption Unit, which was established in 2011 and includes a large staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special unit "Hammer", who after 2009 forced the "waste cartel" of Montreal, to stop the increase in the value of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Next up is Gilles Vaillantcourt, recently retired as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He's suspected of receiving bribes for placing government contracts.
In addition, several Montreal Railroad engineers and Italian-born construction contractors, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were indicted.
The latter exploded a real bombshell, telling the investigation about the "system" of obtaining government contracts.
For years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of contracts in Montreal to a mob-linked broker who in turn transferred money to Mayor Gerald Trumbull's United Montreal party.
In the 2000s, Zambito moved money back and forth, transferring more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various provincial parties, mostly the Liberals, who were then in power.
He also admitted to illegally collecting funds for former Liberal deputy prime minister Natalie Normando.
Sewer contracts that were overpriced
In Montreal, the corruption "system" was in full swing.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenan described it in detail to the commission: Over the course of ten years, he received gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and bribes totaling $736,000 from construction firms in exchange for sewage contracts he overstated.
Other officials responsible for road construction admitted to getting their hands dirty by overcharging by 30-40% with fake additions.
Then one of the mayor's party organizers, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Trumbull of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that was filling party coffers with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first MPs in Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of Rivier de Prairie County on the east side of the island, she's been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal lot that was bought for $5 million and sold for... $1.6 million to developers at the height of the building boom.
70% of the dirty money in the election campaign
She says that in the investigation that will eventually begin, she will "pull a thread that will allow us to understand the functioning of the ant-infested system to stop gangrene and identify the culprits".
She describes the process as "painful but positive".
We're in the process of cleaning up the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to prevent a recurrence of questionable practices.
How we clean our house.
I'm going regular.
Jacques Duchesne notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about the scheme" but did not participate in the fraud.
Given that the proportion of dirty money in Quebec campaign financing is as high as 70%, he jokes: "I was told that this was just a faint reflection of reality".
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but he says that will not change the situation: "Until we strictly limit campaign spending, there will be dirty money in politics".
He demands a complete overhaul of the system of government contracts and party funding: "We cannot sink below; by boldly getting to the bottom of things, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy".
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesne invites those who laugh to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have achieved an extraordinary level of success at PSG.
How do you explain this growth?
It could be explained by individual consciousness, but it could also be a new dimension of the PTSD.
The big players are here.
I grow up with them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors are what keep me raising my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
Football is a fast game.
But I'm not getting hot.
From the beginning at the NIF Pre-Training Centre in Clairfontaine until I came to Saint-Étienne, I was always moving forward.
So you're taking advantage of the competition that Carlo Ancelotti has set up...
It's not unusual for a replacement this summer to play very high-level matches.
They also know that every workout is important.
It's what makes a player like me want to be at the top of his game and do his best.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti is supporting my positioning.
He's got deputies like Claude Makelele, who played the same position I did.
Ancelotti is the boss?
- Of course you are.
Ancelotti has a lot of respect for all the technical staff.
Today, he is second to none in the Premier League and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with top clubs.
He's worked with some great players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
I had a very encouraging conversation with him in January.
I was recovering from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season for PSG?
Lyon has taken our lead in the Premier League.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for one of the eight finals.
What is the club's goal in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
From now on, anything is possible.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group before Porto to be able to take the return match in the same round of 16.
Can PSG become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for that...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and secure a long-term position.
Not today.
The PSJ has the financial means to make this project a reality.
Not winning the Premier League title like last season would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to win this championship.
We were close last season.
In May, it was disappointing because we had everything to come out on top.
It's been a very successful season.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually, 79 points is the champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's going to be okay.
Despite the fact that strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are in the title race, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media expects too much from the PSL?
It's only natural that we're expected to do a lot, given how much we've invested and what kind of players we have.
We're fully prepared for that.
On the other hand, when we're 4-0 up at home against Troy and we still get something to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We ask ourselves what people want from us in the first place.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement a game design.
The team builds over time.
We've proven in the Champions League that we can meet the challenges of our time.
Look at Manchester United, who have failed to reach the last eight for two seasons, despite spending a lot of money too!
Given the amount of money involved, we're 15 points ahead of you by the winter break.
It would be a disrespect to our opponents and to the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at their best last season, were "awakened" by this new PSG.
It just goes to show how exciting the Premier League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and say to ourselves that despite all the difficulties, we have won.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits.
What if they say there's a "Gold Addiction"?
It just means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He's here to prove he's a Premier League star.
Everywhere he played, he showed he was a great player and a star on a global scale.
We respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was truly exceptional.
It's a motivation for others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How was Euro 2012 with the French national team?
It's disappointing.
I wanted to be a part of this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury kept me from getting some playing time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
I 'm getting good qualifying matches today .
This is what I've been hoping for since I was baptized into the Blue.
We've learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine, and now we must behave in a good way.
What do you think of Didier Descham's first months at the helm of the Blues?
They're effective for him.
He's got a good spot in the World Cup qualifiers.
He's a strict coach, he's close to the players and he inspires them to win.
What Laurent Blanc was like.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc has achieved his goal, he qualified us for Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved 1-1 draw on October 16 in Spain is a crucial match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone else.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never played a match like this in my career.
Pay and sell without banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of current money exchange, based on central banks, numbered transactions between receiving parties with processing fees.
And as is often the case with these technologies, there is a political vision that is obvious: the belief that the current monetary system, which consists of banking monopolies, is leading to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure BitTorrent-type exchange protocol that allows file sharing between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered from 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept Bitcoin for donations or as a form of payment.
The bitcoin price peaked at $30 (€23) in June 2011, dropped to $2 five months later, before returning to around $10 today (rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency published in October showed interest in the system.
He describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies as "credits" used to promote a video game, which are earned during the game or which can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the exchange is always controlled and processed by some central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes are simultaneously accountants, auditors, issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually happens between two email addresses, just like an email.
Only for each new payment can the user choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The information set relating to this transaction is signed electronically, using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The contents of the file allow us to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public ledger that is being sent out across the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this ledger.
It goes through solving a mathematical problem, sent to the computers, and the solver, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege of adding this new line.
It's the hashing phase of a file, which is the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
The computers take the new transaction and add a number to it before hashing it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, other nodes can easily check that it's correct.
The transaction is thus inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If a user wanted to double-pay with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes) to deceive, only one of the two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the reward is regularly halved, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by one hundred millionth, which leaves a reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with increasing computing power.
The life of the web has had its ups and downs.
Bitcoin service sites were attacked and bitcoins were stolen from the reserves.
"The flaw used is not the protocol itself", says Pierre Nouaza, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes real money payments using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this drawback.
Big players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
The "giant sales" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars was exchanged", says Jon Holmquist of Coinabul, a bitcoin gold exchange.
Pierre Nouaza, another author of the currency guide, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which is cheaper.
The owner has better control over their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who don't need to install new devices or software.
Just give the address, which can be "photographed and recognized" with the phone, says Pierre Nouaza, who says he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend to re-think hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
"It will be a while before Bitcoin is established, but 2013 could be a turning point", he predicts.
The ECB's report suggests, by the way, that a variety of risks, which are now considered high, should be reviewed if the system succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to follow in late 2014.
It's time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory and for the Afghan people to choose their own future, not relying on us alone.
We were mainly targeting Afghan peasants, whom we considered terrorists.
And we're alone, with 88 soldiers dead and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case under the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They're tolerated, sometimes aided by local rebels, but they'll be gone once the West becomes more subtle.
The French troop withdrawal from the Nizrab base, which I watched from the heights of the almond-covered hills thanks to French loans, went smoothly.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles, accompanied by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014 , there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul .
The circumstances have changed since their relentless advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, the country was in flames and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
Their taking control of the country was then seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid the price for the farmers' obscurantism, which was surpassed by Al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved.
The former mujahedeen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They became dealers who took over public lands to sell them for development to returnees from Iran and Pakistan, using huge US subcontracting contracts.
They're discredited; most of them, by the way, never even fought.
People, as I heard in the countryside, want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have been able to leave through American generosity: capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world in exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
We must provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to the gloom of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including the armed militants, loves cell phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world and which are watched everywhere.
We have an army now.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
Old commanders who were fighting the anti-Soviet struggle are already taking measures to restore provincial druzhines that would not be subject to the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to some extent, following the pattern of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which had existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even before, has been dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been rebuilt, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system is being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, government control over infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
It only reinforced the sense that Western countries were there to take over.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site, without transportation to export it over mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese had almost abandoned the Mes Aynac copper deposit, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist complex and remain the province's largest employers.
It is also necessary that one day Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, should restore normal relations on an equal footing.
The withdrawal of French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a lyceum for girls, a lyceum for boys, a French language faculty at the university, a French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "win hearts and minds" and accomplish the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the Ministry of Defense's "military-civilian activity" service (Cimic), abolished in 2012, along with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local labor, were able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing arable land.
What will we leave in our memory by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in the province of Capisa.
To get rid of the foreign-led insurgencies, which the farmers want, they told me, is to give them a little non-military support that's well controlled and goes directly to them.
The difficult birth of the Egyptian Constitution
This is another risky move by President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it emergency powers, he has decided to play the wa-bank.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to finish the job.
For almost two years, Egypt has relied on a draft text that has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal conflicts.
This new initiative only intensified the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "violate this word" and "trample the law".
His followers believe that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to abandon their intention to explain the text to the Egyptians, article by article.
For the president, it's also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy while the nation is in turmoil.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote yes, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
The call for an expedited vote is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text or I will keep the emergency powers", which are supposed to end after the constitution is adopted.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to make their point.
Representatives of human rights groups, religious minorities, and civil society have done the same.
To reach the required quorum, 11 people, reserve members, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, most articles were unanimously approved.
The commentators, by the way, were amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day was over... the time of prayer, as some committee members felt that the constituent assembly clock was mis-set.
The text, which was voted on yesterday, has 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, Article 2 ended up being the identical article from the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would allow for their stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", say liberals, who see it as just PR.
Because they think the Islamization of the Constitution is through other articles.
They point in particular to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, particularly in relation to verifying the compliance of laws with Sharia.
This is alarming, says Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, because "the people who make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy".
We can see the birth of theocracy".
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the next president of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"There is no specific religious intervention at this time.
With this constitution, we remain within the civil rights framework.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulema, but people with university degrees, some of them trained in the French system", says Alexis Bloye, who is working on a thesis on Egypt's constitutional transition.
But he admits that "there may be ambiguity around Article 220, as the terms used are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This is particularly true of fiqh.
And in the future, the question may arise as to whether civil judges are competent to rule on this".
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is under criticism because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they have decreased significantly from what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention is the authority of the army.
In accordance with the military's wishes, the defense budget will not be considered in Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Nor will it prohibit the trial of civilians in military courts, despite the pleas of human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about a text they consider to be destructive to freedom.
Blasphemy is still punishable, and insulting is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles speak of protecting women anymore, stresses Heba Moraef of Human Rights Watch.
She said the only positive aspect was the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
A word that didn't appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The president's supporters will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Earth's core and the sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of Bible truths with modern conveniences and the primal nature.
The AIF has identified the five most important reasons to visit Israel.
Worshiping at Holy Places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that God's favor descends upon all who enter the "bath".
And Galilee is the site of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming a storm, and filling nets.
There Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
But most of all, the holy places in Jerusalem.
The faithful walk the Way of Sorrow or the Way of the Cross (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the Antonia Fortress - the Praetorium - where the court was located, and leads along the streets of the Old City to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha - the place of the Crucifixion, the Stone of Anointing, and the burial place of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian "Puppet of the Earth", symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site of a tree that, according to Christian legend, was used to make a cross for Jesus.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site for Jews - the Wailing Wall, a remnant of the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of all faiths leave wishes here, which are then fulfilled.
Going Vertically
The ruins of Masada are what remain of a secret refuge from enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on steep rocks in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are fond of climbing can walk to them.
The rest of the way up to this historic peak is by cable car.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
A shuttle bus takes him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski trails is 45 km .
According to an old legend, the pagan gods lived on top of the mountain.
Visiting the most unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't go to all of them in one trip.
But at least five of the most interesting ones are worth visiting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in caves in the Judean Desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological artifacts.
You should also visit the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
His exposition is widely represented by the paintings of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Accra, you can visit the Al Bash Museum-Bath, which is a collection of ancient Turkish baths with the mules of visitors and bankers of the time.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and no donations are accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells the story of one of history's most dramatic pages.
The most tragic section, the Children's Memorial, commemorates the 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk in, you're in total darkness.
The stars are twinkling.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries where they died.
Ukraine is mentioned there too.
Get well .
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of these has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums, and oceanariums.
Interestingly, bathing in the Red Sea is possible even during the winter months, since the water temperature is not below 70 degrees Fahrenheit [21°C], and the air warms up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit [23°C].
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and swimming is available year-round.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is located at the lowest point on the planet - 1,300 feet [417 m] below sea level.
The azure water in it is a brine that easily keeps even the completely unable to swim afloat.
The scenery around is incredibly beautiful.
They come here to get a course of saline water, rapeseed, and healing mud, and to treat dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to fix the damaged nerves.
Touch the secrets of the ancient world
They are kept in the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean Sea.
The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia passed through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander the narrow streets named after the zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your sign, fortune will be favorable.
In Joppa, you can meet newlyweds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander around the Roman theater and "take" the crusader fortress.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the chief city of Judea and the seat of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
A tourist for a note
When you travel to Israel, don't worry about your poor English: About 30 percent of the population speaks Russian.
It is better to take money for travel in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekels (now 1 dollar - 3.8 shekels).
The city's transportation is mainly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and in Haifa - the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper.
It's basically an underground funicular.
All forms of public transport cost 6 shekels, which can be used for a journey of 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Sabbath is observed on the Sabbath day.
From Friday night until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, and public transportation are closed.
And Sunday morning is the start of the work week.
Many cafes, restaurants, and hotels offer kosher food only, excluding pork, seafood, fish without the shell, and foods that are mixed with milk and meat.
There is a wide selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts made with coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus pasta, various sauces, ground nut balls - falalel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are plenty of fat cats that are walking around on their own.
At night, they can be seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The Moor likes crowded places and will not refuse a treat.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus the insurance is $15 a day.
And the bike rental will cost 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets are an average of 30 shekels.
In the language of numbers
In 2012, over three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
The most visitors were from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine.
The Promised Land was visited by 118,800 Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the visa was abolished on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" will take migrants to Moscow
While lawmakers and human rights activists debate the law on compulsory language testing, fraudsters selling fake certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million tourists visit Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support their families back home.
A law has come into force on December 1 that obliges every migrant to take a Russian language test.
This rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service, housing, utilities, retail and household sectors.
However, over time, the FMS promises, testing will become mandatory for all visitors.
At the same time, you will have to pass not only the language, but also Russian history and the basics of legislation.
You will need to prove your knowledge of the language both for obtaining and for renewing your work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
People who managed to get their certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are also exempt from the law.
Benefit, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, SPbSU and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to take the tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law came into force, human rights activists had time to ask the press many times: What will this actually do?
What will change the language requirement for both Russians and foreigners?
First of all, they say, it will reduce the number of people who are "slaves".
Many are talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federal Migration Service's representative office in Tajikistan.
Protecting their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems are with migrants who have no job, no education, no language, no medical certificate.
Without language skills, Sebelev believes, a future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who will, under the guise of help, push him into a creepy, cramped barracks, where he and dozens of others like him will languish for months without food or documents, working 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our immigrants.
"At home they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are cheated, their passports are taken away, they do not pay the promised salary", - says the head of the Main Department of Labour Migration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't you swear, settler!
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics who are going to Russia to work admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they are going to, but also have difficulty writing in their own language.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even a basic education.
Their families have no means to feed their children, let alone to dress them properly, to clothe them, and to provide them with schooling.
As they grow into their teens, these kids go to work at the first opportunity.
"It's hard when you're not good at the language", they admit.
"Feeling humiliated and inferior".
However, there is one important point that human rights activists note regarding the language law.
The test will only be given to those migrants who have legal status.
If you don't have a status, you won't have an exam or any official job.
Meanwhile, most of the foreigners are still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or outsiders are not allowed".
Many of the visitors claim that it is not easy to get official status in our country.
The reason is the bureaucratic hurdles and all the same language barriers.
Besides, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and for only a thousand and a half.
Russian police know that we have mostly fake papers, no registration, hence extortion cases.
"They ask for a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea", Tajik citizen Umed Khushkadamov told reporters.
"Fly, don't be stingy, buy the painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was discovered that not only immigration registration documents are fake.
Some fake language test certificates have already been confiscated by the FMS.
The fake paper is printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get them for free: each of the migrants, hoping to make the test easier, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as expensive as the official testing procedure, which would cost a migrant worker 3,000.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that the "shortcuts" cannot be bought, both government officials and human rights activists agree.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise foreigners who fail to pass the test the first time, time to learn the basic language course.
In addition, foreigners who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not involve active communication with people.
The MIA is not taking over the illegal arms market .
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry is proposing tougher laws for civilian gun owners.
This is the authorities' reaction to recent incidents: the shooting at a wedding in Nagasaki, which left no casualties, and the massacre by a Moscow lawyer, Dmitry Vinogradov, which left seven people dead.
Police want to ban the wearing of helmets in public and raise the age of a gun license from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Counter-Corruption Irina Yarova and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be introduced in the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by "twisting the knot".
An open letter has appeared online, with the authors - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demanding that the "senseless tightening" be abandoned.
The percentage of registered gun hooligans is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov told the BBC Russian Service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 142 crimes with firearms were registered in the internal affairs bodies in the six months of 2012, while only 1168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of gun laws does not put the criminal on the black market.
Now, they say, you can find any weapon in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry claims to be in control of the illegal weapons situation.
Suppliers: From factories to officers
The black market for weapons is being replenished through several channels.
The main channels are five, says retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that takes orders for weapons
The first is the "army or military trail", that is, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were carried by Russian officers and Caucasians themselves", Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon" is stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these include items taken from police stores and stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
The illegal "stems" are being sold from military warehouses.
Explosions were common in many military warehouses.
"There are proven versions that some of the arson was done on purpose - to cover up the shortfall", says a former military man.
The weapons manufacturers are making a contribution, according to Barantz.
"Now there are private arms factories that cannot compete in the international market and throw weapons from the floor to the black market, including Moscow", says the expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Especially large quantities of guns and rifles come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production, sometimes handicraft, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow", explains a former military man.
Where did you get the guns?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each source of illegal arms supplies to the black market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and State-Management Design.
The experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, the criminological literature and the open data of portals on the subject of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers say, come from the military and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all arms on the black market are "the fault of officials whose jobs involve weapons", says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from the sites of armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen at the stage of production of weapons, 5% are "black archaeology".
A sales consultant at a gun shop who asked not to be named says that the weapons found by the black miners have been out of stock for a long time - they are too old.
Most often, he says, the sellers go to the military warehouse to buy a new shipment.
An ensign is the person who buys a unit, like a T.T. gun.
He gets it prescribed, passed through the patch.
"He takes it to the city and sells it here for 900 euros a piece with two shops", he says.
"The truth is that the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically when the crime-solving plan is on fire, they make control purchases from the illegal arms dealers", adds the consultant.
"It's like a fancy store".
The seller and the buyer are more likely to find each other through acquaintances.
I was looking at websites, blogs, until a friend answered me and said, "Come on, let's go to the Runway platform, where there's a guy who'll take me to the corner where we can trade".
I only learned the value of a gun there.
The military observer Viktor Baranets
"I need a friend who knows how to get a gun", says a salesman-consultant.
There are vendors in the markets, but you also have to come there, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to tell you that his daughter's tooth fell out".
I'm even getting a couple of cassettes now through someone I trust.
He only delivers them to me, too, because he knows I won't give him up.
The newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranets tried his hand at buying illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing a paper on the subject.
The patterns, he says, haven't changed.
They gave him a photo album that said "anything".
"I felt like I was in a high-end department store", recalls a soldier.
The buyer, according to Barantz, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything is tasty.
I, the prospect, don't just buy, we go with the seller into the woods, we target.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm sure the gun is good, we start trading", the expert describes.
Shop on the couch.
Internet search engines lead to sites and groups in Vkontakte that offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No papers or personal meetings are required.
"Just have a certain amount of money", says an advertising cap on the website Buy a Gun or Machine Gun.
Users can leave their applications and ask questions.
And sell to minors?
"Without a license, of course", says user "Ivan" (spelling saved).
I'm buying T.T. Moscow, as Fedorenkov has said.
The F.S.B.I. has now dismantled a vast network of bogus websites and people willing to buy combat weapons with a paddle.
People go like hungry fish to feed, then they mine coal in Siberia.
Victor Baranets , military observer and former military man
I've heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer pays through the ATM.
"In response, they send a photograph and instructions where the weapons are hidden", says Dmitry Kislov, spokesman for the nonprofit organization Right to Bear Arms.
Viktor Baranets claims that by leaving an application on the website, you can be left without a weapon and go to jail.
The F.S.B.I. has now dismantled a vast network of bogus websites and people willing to buy combat weapons with a paddle.
"People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they mine coal in Siberia", he says.
The makers for $ 100 .
The cost of buying a small-arms gun illegally is estimated by experts to be between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Right to Bear Arms organization, Makarov's pistol can be purchased for $100 to $300.
It'll take a month and a half.
It's being shipped from long-term storage by the management of these medium-level warehouses.
According to official statistics of the department, compared to January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22,9 thousand, and the number of detected theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7,8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers are on strike in the US
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers go through a McDonald's job.
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has swept across America at Walmart department stores and fast-food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or if it will die out in the early stages.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the meager salaries of ordinary workers at Walmart and fast food chains, the protestors' goal is to create trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is barely covered by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, when a flurry of low-cost sales swept America, capturing millions of locals and sometimes leading to fights.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and picketed with unions and left-wing activists the company's stores, whose products are designed for low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers and hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners and eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
So many of Walmart's low-paid employees are just at work.
The availability and variety of products made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
Critics say Walmart can afford to sell goods at a lower price partly because it pays its workers less.
The latter also complain of harsh working conditions, such as a lack of truckloaders or hand-held scanners.
Black Friday protesters demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of corporate health insurance had jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart worker, who earns $9.5 an hour, they said, can't afford it.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have shown that if Walmart raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1 percent more than she spends on her salary right now.
If Walmart put all the pay rise on the shoulders of the customers, it would cost them just 46 cents more per store visit.
In a year, they'll spend about $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters have pointed out that the protests have taken place in only nine states and have not caused the company any damage.
Black Friday lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Dan Vogelman, a corporate spokesman, claimed in an interview with the Huffington Post that "fewer than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs in total, and that the protest was just "another PR stunt" by the union that organized it.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York City, where they targeted not Walmart department stores (they are not lazy in this progressive city, so they are not here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then it doesn't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work!
Jumeirah Williams, member of the New York City Council
At this time, the federal minimum wage and the New York minimum wage are $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants have been increasing their rates over time, but not by much, and their average New York City worker is making $8.90 an hour.
They're the lowest paid people in this expensive town.
How you can live in New York City on that kind of money is beyond me.
At one time, nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after school while living at home.
Few saw it as their main source of livelihood or planned to stay there for long.
Now I keep coming across interviews with McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live on that salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal's forum has a commentary that says it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're feeding them.
The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks at the fast food chain be paid at least $15 an hour, more than doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing or punishing union activists by harassment and firing.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it's difficult to get a union to cover fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary fluidity of the personnel.
Disagree
Noisy protests took place that day at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The protest culminated in a mid-day rally outside McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians spoke, including City Councilman Jumeyn Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then it doesn't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work!"
The protesters were joined by other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we must come together to support fast food workers to get the fair pay and economic prosperity every New Yorker deserves!"
The New York Times described it as the largest such action in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated, and not all of them were fast food workers, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It's not clear if this spark will ignite a mass movement.
"So far, the brain is only average".
The popular topic of augmented reality among fans of modern technology has recently been taken up mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Google first showed the current model at its annual conference in the summer, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had filed a patent application for the same.
However, a conversation with Sharam Izadi, head of interactive 3D at Microsoft's Cambridge lab, shows that the company's glasses are a step too far.
They're fascinated by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Can you tell us in general terms what your research team does?
We're dealing with human-machine interaction, but we're also trying to push the boundaries of that interaction.
So far, humanity has been stuck in the pixel stage on a flat screen, sometimes with a little bit of a thumbs up.
We want to look five to 10 years ahead and predict the dramatic changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is sold without the Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else is ahead?
- Even though the Kinect has moved the interaction to the physical level, a lot of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input is better (the system gets more data), and the output is not so good.
We're trying to change that, and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems based on a variety of technologies, including projective.
We need to bring the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
But to do that, you have to recognize not only the user, but also the space around them.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient way.
And first of all, screw these stupid VR helmets!
- What do you think of the voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It's definitely not a panacea - it's a privacy issue because you don't always want to let people know about your actions and intentions.
Actually, all kinds of computer interactions are good, but each in its own niche.
For example, for controlling devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not the big ones, but the cheap ones, the short ones.
The gestures were recorded not with the camera of the device, but with a wristband that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It's still big, but theoretically, it could be shrunk to the size of a wristwatch.
But the future is generally mixed control, like gesture plus voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how do you ask me to hand you this can of soda?
You say it and you show it.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to tell.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine may or may not be able to do at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual bond.
I think in the near future, we're going to have to work on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution at depth, which is very important.
Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Missing resolution, depth or something?
- Basically, this generation is what we can build on in our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at 1,000 kph.
But it's not about the megapixels themselves, it's about the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In the end, all the current technologies are not good enough for us -- it adds to the work of algorithm designers.
So you have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also the Z axes.
Speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current 30 kph is frankly low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betheches from our Redmond lab made a touch sensor with a controllable processing delay of 1 to 100 milliseconds, and modern serial sensors are closer to the second 60 to 100 point.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
I could really use the equivalent of this in my line of work, but one that doesn't require touch to get more frames per second.
- Shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a normal visible-field sensor.
It's not used to determine the depth of an object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the amount of computation required.
It would be nice to build a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how it helps in 3D positioning.
- As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, never released its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technology, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
Of course, walking around with your smartphone in your hands all the time is not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be a "transitional" augmented reality, where you could switch from glasses to your smartphone, projection screen, and so on, everywhere, based on a cloud platform.
Glasses are a very personal device, and that's their strength (only you can see private things), and their weakness - augmented reality based on glasses won't let you work on virtual objects with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is not only possible for Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also for a mere mortal.
There's a problem that critics of this idea often point out: no tactile feedback!
The hands feel nothing!
What responses is your group preparing to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth could be the addition of tactile sensation.
So, one of the interesting tricks is to use the other hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
She's a great click recorder!
But there are technologies that really aim to give these images in the air a tangible feel -- for example, the interference of multiple directional ultrasound rays at a specific point where your finger is, which gives you a feeling, but it's still very faint -- like you're being blown on pillows.
And there are wrist bracelets that affect nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a promising area.
- Did you try to trick the brain?
Make him think he's feeling what he's supposed to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
There's another challenge that we're still struggling with, which is how to make a person who's physically in a very confined space believe that they're walking in an open, almost infinite space, and we're working on the concept of running tracks (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms, and huge balls.
As long as the brain is being fooled, it's still a long way off.
That's what makes VR work so appealing to the researcher -- a lot of things are in their infancy.
The taste of culture instead - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are in the forefront of culture and art.
The list includes notable figures of the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city, often gaining recognition in Europe, bypassing the Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalth" is the epic artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red, who is seen at the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, fashion parties and vernisages.
Kirill Miller's paintings always draw crowds wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social-philosophical story tellers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright figure of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
He's also a city man, who brings smiles to the streets, who lifts everyone's spirits.
He recently took the charm in his hands and became a St. Petersburg charmmaker, having matured for this difficult role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why do you walk around town in all the red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
I chose red as a fashion designer who deals with appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker and society.
Although in society, anything that's not a little gray causes aggression and the arousal of a bad trait.
But my provocations are designed to start a conversation.
The whole point of my provocative actions is to invite discussion.
- When did you know you wanted to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the Nevsky Park, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that this was my path.
Then the wave of old free informal artists passed, and new, free artists like me were unintelligible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gasovskaya, which led to the "Pushkin-10", and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theater, clothes, music, everything but words.
And all this was combined in your Art Clinic... it was important to me to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took over the Pushkin-10 area, and there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, a St. Petersburg bohemian house, before the renovation.
A lot of people were born there: N.O.M., Tequila jazz, I remember when the String came with the Van Gogh Ear project.
String and his friends sang light songs under the fan, they were in a pulling trico, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs before the time of the Khali-Galiv.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career was over, and he received his basic education and upbringing from us.
The D137 gallery, the Griboed Club, they're echoes of the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and regulars went.
I'm a hero from a century ago, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was "People of our city".
I was nominated for Artist of the Year, and that was my climax.
In the new times, it's uncomfortable to work by the old rules. I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture from the last century.
It's easy to be popular in this day and age, but culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular but not very cultural.
- Your work has a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they are very relevant and sharp.
I'm having a programming exhibition, "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now being that is painful and scary.
But clowns are blurry, they're tragic.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
Like saving the world by orderly totalitarian disguise.
Now, people are judging by the outer mechanics of their clothes, not the inner person.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by disguise.
And the other day, we saw you as the town charmer.
Who else but me?
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful.
- Now commercial art has to be neat, tactful, sweet.
There is a disintegration of cultures.
People used to get lost in packs, bohemians liked one thing, commoners liked another.
Now, everybody's in micro-communities, and it's hard to please everybody.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to be liked by everyone.
Now we need to figure out who likes you.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailov is worth several thousand!
- He gets the brooches, the sex-social sphere works.
And on the cultural front, 300 people will come, 10,000 won't, and the result is less management, less money, everything dries up.
I have fans, the important thing is not to deceive them, not to ruin what you've gained.
I painted these when I was younger, and one of the collectors had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with the paintings that usually end with.
It's a bit confusing these days.
They say culture is spiritual, culture is consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I'm a man of yesterday's culture, raised by artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, giving up money to paint.
I'm all for this culture.
- Kirill, what is missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a term for this: cultural official.
But not everyone can be a cultural person.
The right kings didn't have that, and the kings may not have been very culturally savvy, but they knew they needed to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're pushed, because we need higher experts to properly evaluate these experts and give them a path.
The taste buds are thriving.
The same Errata, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, Moscow has more culture, there is soil.
And on our rocks, art is hard to grow.
We need culture, and we have more writers than readers, and that's wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of tonic.
We need to make art fashionable like it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented on the basis of the grant of St. Petersburg
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a killer asteroid strike.
Caravans of spacecraft with Earthlings on board are sent out to search for a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the big question is, how do we continue our species in zero gravity or on the same alternate planet?
I think we're a little short of options.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be explored, at least hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars", - said Vladimir Surdin, senior research fellow at the State Astronomical Institute named after P. K. Shternberg (GAIH).
But if Mars is more habitable, Venus' surface is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in orbit around Venus... in space.
The first approach to reproduction in space was with flora.
Half a century ago, they did experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then we're going to orbit insects, tiny fruit flies, the Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to test how an embryo develops in weightlessness.
We get a perfectly normal chick out.
And here's where the problem starts.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, get on its feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory at the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The chicks were unable to find support and were crawling about in disorder.
And within 10 hours, the newborns were atrophied completely.
The chicks didn't respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, four days later, they were dead.
"We hatched chicks twice, then we refused because it was impossible to work with them there", says Vladimir Sychev, who has been unsuccessful in his experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a biological minivan was in orbit with animals was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the Bion biosatellite will only have one-sexed individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with a fetus.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again - it is a single experiment, and such research should be conducted", - says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
But we're not really getting to the problem of reproduction in space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their habitats, simply cannot exercise their sex instincts.
Humans, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens have abstract thinking, and they can create the appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, we don't do experiments like this.
But women have been flying in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive the flight into space.
Whether she can have a baby after this flight.
"No one answered that question", says rocket and space veteran Vakhtang Vaknaidze.
In June 1964, just a year after her first space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who had been to space twice and even worked in outer space, had a son.
But the risk remains.
We have a small number of astronauts who have survived long flights and are growing up healthy.
"If it is more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights", - summarizes the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, creating artificial gravity.
The hydrological laboratory of the CPC is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy conditions, astronauts are practicing their skills in outer space.
Water is imitating weightlessness.
While water is a comfortable yet alien environment for adults, it is a natural element for infants.
The little ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on land came from the ocean.
There's a connection between the fact that the baby is in the mother's amniotic fluid for about nine months, and it's easier for him to get used to the water afterwards.
It's logical, because from the moment you're born, from the moment you bathe for the first time, it's only two weeks.
"It's not enough to forget something", says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if weightlessness is more natural for a newborn baby, gravity is more necessary for a woman.
Very quickly in weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, pelvis, the ability to push the fetus down.
All right, let's lower that by relying on stimulators.
You can, of course, go to a special delivery room, she'll push him out.
"What next?" - asks Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, a baby needs artificial gravity, too.
Without gravity, the body cannot form a skeleton and a muscular system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special training suit.
He will simply be deprived of what he needs to live.
"And this experiment, which we will go to, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled, completely unadapted person", - predicts the head of the Committee on Bioethics of the IMBP of the Russian Academy of Sciences Igor Pestow.
So far, having babies in space is a matter of theory.
However, in time, this will become a reality when Earthlings in their ships travel to a distant planet to become home to their spaceship-born descendants.
The chief of the inspection department says the blacklisting failed because of politicians.
The Czech Republic has good control authorities in the public procurement sector and, despite having quality legislation, is lagging behind in its application.
This is Miroslav Kal, vice president of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack", commented Kala on the current situation.
The Czech and German inspection authorities have issued similar reports.
An example of a wrong practice is the approach of Peter Nechas to the so-called Schwarz-System.
The Prime Minister recently said that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections - is this prohibited or allowed?
"The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the prime minister cannot stand in the way of the institutions that are charged with checking and enforcing the obligations", says Kala.
At the House of Representatives' audit committee, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties to compare the public procurement legislation of both countries.
What was the point?
I mean, a parallel check we started, like, two years ago.
In other words, European legislation sets out how public procurement should be conducted, followed by national legislation and then also practical application.
All the information has been collected and, even with the unfinished investigation, interesting differences have been found - in simple terms, we may have a "precise and error-free" legislation, but in practice we are behind Germany in some parameters.
This means that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, we need to focus on the application of the law itself.
And how exactly can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this kind of joint control that can help stop the effort to clarify laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it's not the fact that we're going to get there by reducing the order limit.
Perhaps the system will become so overwhelmed with paperwork that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not been relaxed.
You're talking about the internal problems of the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our C.R.U. or does it work differently?
As for the institutions, there is the Bundesrechnungshof, which is our CRU, and it is organized in our way. There is also a board that works a little differently, but basically both institutions work in the same way.
In addition, the powers are similar to a certain extent, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the level of the federal states - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Accounts Chamber.
As far as local laws go, is it easier there than here?
I don't want to make a comparison without specific data, but in some ways Germany is a good example, but you can't say for sure that it's better in everything.
Is it because they're better at controlling?
Definitely not, but I don't like comparisons like that.
But even the best countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any advantage from working with our office, would they?
Speaking of domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affect your institution, are there any consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet been demonstrated in our control work.
Since we're conducting a fact-finding mission, we're going to have to take into account some delays.
We're just taking this into account in the process of preparing future audits -- we've started using our new tool called the "discount risk detection" tool, which we've run through almost 14,000 government contracts. We've analyzed them.
Do you think that passing this law will bring benefits or additional burden on the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it proves it.
The problem that can arise is that the rules become so harsh that they become unenforceable.
Under the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - to the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the public procurement law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in this way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system should exclude those who want to seize and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that doesn't affect the decision.
Such a system would only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do you get out of this situation?
Let's face it, this road leads nowhere.
The Prime Minister recently said that the GOP would not bother businessmen with the so-called Schwarz system.
Is the Schwartz system prohibited or allowed?
The law should be in place in some way, and if it prohibits something, the prime minister cannot stand in the way of the bodies charged with checking and enforcing the obligations.
You can say, "We're going to change this law and we're going to allow this", but you can't say we're going to pretend like nothing's happening.
The Public Procurement Act has pretty strict rules about how and what should be done formally, and that's right.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified solely because of formal flaws.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack.
The roads are slippery in places, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snow-covered.
Most of them are passable, but some are more cautious.
The Karlovy Vary region
This morning in Karlovy Vary the roads were clear, but some places frozen and snowed.
The temperature has dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but it should warm up a little during the day.
Snowfall in the region has stopped, only a small layer lies in the lowlands.
However, the mountain ranges of the Ore Mountains have about 30 centimeters of snow.
Information from the regional road workers revealed that visibility was lower in some places due to fog.
The R6 expressway and first class roads in the region are currently free of restrictions.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be bumpy and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain tracks, are also passable.
But in some areas, there are still traces of frozen snow and some heavy snow.
Especially should you be careful on roads that are located on hillsides.
Pardubice and Kralevgrad region
The Czech Roads and Highways Authority has posted on its website that some roads in the east of the country are at risk of avalanche, and that there may be a thick layer of snow on mountain roads and high-altitude roads.
Regional road workers warn drivers about ice that may form especially in the hills of the Pardubice region.
Snow may fall near Lanshcrown, Usti nad Orlicami, Polichki, Sviatavi or Visoke-Mito, especially on second and third class roads.
I/43 and I/34 roads near Svitova are chemically treated.
Snow is especially heavy on the roads of the Krkonoše and Orlić Mountains.
The snow cover is on the roads located on the hills in the Richnov-nad-Knezhnou and Trutnov districts.
In the eastern Czech Republic, today, it's variable cloud cover, no rain.
Temperatures usually range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
The Pilsner region
The roads in the Plzeň region are clear this morning, but in some places you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, temperatures range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, it can be slippery in some places.
Drivers may experience fog in some places, but visibility will improve gradually.
The information was provided by the regional road workers.
The D5 is now virtually unrestricted, but road authorities recommend caution between 50 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads are dry and frozen.
In southern Plzeň and Tahov, there may be a lot of land.
Second and third class roads are wet, and there is also a warning about possible slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the underused roads in the Shumava area.
The Olomouc region
Drivers heading to the Olomouc hills should be aware of the snow on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenogorsk saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlsky Krshiz.
The snowfall forced road workers to go outside at night, according to information from the road administration, about three centimeters of snow fell in Shumperk.
In other areas of the road edge, the road is usually unrestricted.
"On the hills of the Shumperk lies the remnants of snow.
Drivers heading towards Yesenica should be aware of the presence of snow in the Chervenogorsk Seder", the traffic controller of the Szumperk road administration told the Czech News Agency.
Their colleagues from Yesenik also went to clean the roads at night, assuring them that the roads on the hills after the chemical treatment remained bare and wet.
In Olomouc, the roads are free, but in Sternberg, drivers should be careful in forest areas where there is still moisture.
The Ustec region, the Liberec region
This morning, road workers in northern Bohemia report that there are still some difficult spots to cross.
According to the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snow, the mountain road is closed in the area from Teľnice to Klinnice in the Ustec region.
The temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially to the south-east of the Czech Central Highlands, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
No complications on the roads yet.
Road workers report ice in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, perfect conditions were created for its formation at night - rain and snow melted all day, and the sky cleared and freezes began at night.
There are reports of adverse conditions on the main highway and on the I/13 highway on the border of the Ustec and Liberec regions.
Due to the curved branches of trees touching the road, they were forced to close the road in Telenitsa on the Kninica.
We want to build up positive energy at concerts .
What do you think about the world ending in less than a month?
This is just one of the many disturbing news stories that we humans are so easily exposed to.
And with The Tap Tap, we joke about it all the time, saying that we're the only band in the world that can muster enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you are going to give three absolutely unique concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell us more about that?
This is a nationwide fundraising event that we've been planning for the past two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is set to end on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before this event, on December 20 at 21:00, three concerts will start in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, when the May calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which has a time zone 12 hours ahead of ours.
Whose idea was that?
It was my idea at first, and then we worked on it with our artist Gonzaga Augusta.
Not only do we want to build up enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think with the public about what kind of world we're going to pass on to our children.
To celebrate the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and original doomsday keys that you can buy on www.e-tap.cz and support.
The Tap Tap band, along with other musicians, also performed an anti-doomsday anthem called "The End of the World Is Cancelled".
Will the anthem that YouTube listeners already love be played at these benefit concerts?
Of course, in the end, if it works out and the world doesn't end.
It's sung by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
The anthems will also be broadcast live on Czech television.
The lyrics were written and performed by Tomáš Ganák, who also performs Xindl X...
How did you get involved with them?
We also work with other figures in Czech cultural life, as we hold many charity events and concerts.
We're trying to actively engage them in these projects.
It turns out a lot of people like working with us, they're interested.
What's the proceeds from the apocalypse concert going to do?
To purchase equipment for the STUDEO barrier-free education center, we have been working with the non-governmental organization Tap at the Edellichka Institute for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students at the school and hold fun and interesting activities with them.
Students themselves don't have the means to go to the teachers, and we try to give them that opportunity.
As part of the project to add to the Edlichka Institute, we will build a separate building in the future, which we will move into with this project.
Each concert will feature several musical groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to make a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marjan Bango and Irzy Suki will perform.
You can find out more on www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any such "great events" planned for the future?
In May we will perform at the Prague Spring Festival for the first time and we will of course prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we'd love to do a show at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we're in the U.S., I'd love to do a show in Washington and Chicago.
You have big plans for the outside world. You've performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you handle the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five contestants in electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs have to travel in the luggage compartment, plus a lot of cargo and tool crates.
However, we managed to do it without any problems, and Czech Airlines ČSA and British Airways were always very prepared for us, which surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Traveling abroad allows you to compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything is functioning better than we do, in Russia we have seen that the east is still at the baseline.
Moscow has many barriers compared to Prague, and it is still a freakish place to be able to move around in an electric wheelchair in the city center.
And it's not about the mundane things like giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already NGOs that are trying to bring attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, are we supposed to be constantly catching up to?
There are a lot of things that are way behind the times.
But it's important to note that improvement and improvement always depends on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it's perfectly normal for people with severe disabilities to be able to walk around the streets, go to the bathroom, go to a museum, go anywhere.
It's not very common for people with disabilities to be active in the community, and we're a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Public respect or open borders are one thing, but the moment we have a famous athlete, artist, actor, politician or lawyer, that's when things really start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases of people with strong wills.
The Tap Tap is very popular now, but back to two years ago, in 1998, what made you start it?
I went to the Edellich Institute as a tutor, and I was surrounded by many young people who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician and play saxophone, I organized an interesting music club with a colleague.
Well, as our host Ladia Angelovich says, it got a little out of hand.
Has it only become popular in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It's true, we were helped by the fact that we started to join famous singers and actively work on the promotion of the band.
We've come to the conclusion that work that nobody can evaluate is essentially like it doesn't exist.
Thanks to the European Union's funding, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have a goal to promote The Tap Tap so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential in their ability to do something extraordinary.
Show business is full of things that imitate each other.
It's logical, everything new is taken with a grain of salt, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I would venture to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression a person has of us is of course pity, it's natural...
But this pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not all suffering and abandoned individuals that we should pity.
They are people who can live a full life and thrive, of course, only if they have the resources.
I say that if people with disabilities do something, it's a change not just for them, but for society.
Did your success depend on being the strict leader that many people think you are?
If we want to do a good job, we must be firm in many things and maintain a certain amount of discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the air, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, they have to go to prep classes and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens to any group that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many were there in early 1998?
There's only one Ladia Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the willpower, our doors are always open.
It will be held the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9:00 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in Brno - at the Fléda club and in Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a cable car during the performance of The Tap Tap's "End of the World Is Cancelled".
The aim of this project is to raise funds of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO education centre at the Edellichka Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 kr, children under 12 years of age are free to enter.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of the European Space Agency's ministers, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has been actively involved in a number of ESA projects over the years.
But Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, but this was not always understood.
I'll remind you, for example, of the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933, presented at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his groundbreaking work "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905-born) left the audience indifferent, after a few years, Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peeltry and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great proponent of astronomy and space exploration.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned cosmonaut, and his contribution was recognized in part by the naming of a crater on the far side of the Moon after him.
In 1925 a railway drezin equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remains unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It's not even clear if the missile was meant to accelerate or to brake the cart.
Information about this dressing is known only from the press of the time.
From 1933 on, the Polish artillery began to think about rocket arrows.
The research was carried out by the Section of Weapons Technology in cooperation with professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzitski.
The surviving materials show that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photoelectric fighter rocket was proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, and the following year the work "Air rocket torpedo and aviation rocket bomb" by author Leliv-Kzivoblotsky was published.
Both designs were developed for military use with rocket engines.
Before the war, all projects of military use of rocket technology were undertaken by the Temporary Scientific-Consultative Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its work ended due to the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The society was first mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal "Problems", which published four volumes of articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that would be engaged in space exploration.
At that time, the development of artificial satellites was already in full swing, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Society (POA) has been trying to join the International Astronautics Federation (founded in 1951), and already in the autumn of the POA became its effective member.
And the following year, the first chairman of the PFA, Kazimeg Zarankevich (1902-1959) became the vice chairman of the International Astronaut Federation.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 the POA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to perform scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The missile, capable of a range of 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 two-stage RM-2 rockets were tested in the Bledovo desert.
This missile was about 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already capable of doing real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could cover 14.5 km, and its task was to observe high winds.
But in 1962 further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the chamber for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A had a space of 0.4 liters, the Meteor-1B had 0.34 liters, and the Meteor-1C had 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute was developing the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket, with a launch weight of 380 kg, was capable of delivering a 10 kg payload to a height of about 60 km.
Later versions of the Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to KOSPAR (the Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the national KOSPAR committee two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germanashevsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Repealing the public works law is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court struck down the public works law.
The decision sparked a lively public discussion.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
It basically means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of the significant difference in the cost of labour (wages), price tension arises.
This is when a manufacturer tries to compete economically by delivering a cheap product, thus "beating" the competitor's price to gain a larger share of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either moving production abroad, or buying cheaply abroad, or disappearing, resulting in higher unemployment in those countries where labour costs are high compared to others.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it produces, the inevitable government spending on social needs is growing.
In general, the situation is exacerbating the reluctance of businessmen to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage they cause to society in their pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that no specific statistics are needed.
The unbridled methods of private capital create a situation at the level of individual economies where governments are forced to compete with each other to artificially lower the social standards of their populations in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments are giving their own population to private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected above all in changes to the existing legislation.
The aim is to make the people economically subject to the dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for curtailing workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is increased poverty and, at the same time, the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany, there has been a public distribution of food to the poor who cannot feed themselves with their own labour for several years.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
In order to improve the competitiveness of the German economy, there are always cases where people in employment receive such a salary that the state must pay them extra so that they can get the minimum subsistence level.
A similar scandal has been made public in the case of additional Bundestag employees.
Economic measures in virtually all southern EU countries are undoubtedly leading to the same situation where people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in social status are forced to either emigrate as they did in the 19th century or live on a penny-pinching wage in the backyards of society in the hope that some day private investment capital will come into the country.
But where does it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it won't come at all, because the Chinese, the Indian, the Brazilian, the Turkish, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African still work for a share of European wages.
This is for all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are sickeningly adamant that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists that the state should not interfere in the economy by managing.
The next question to be answered is whether private capital, which now virtually controls politics and the state as a whole, is acting for its own selfish purposes?
The answer is, yes.
The evidence is the existence of almost omnipotent and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a dead end, manifested in corruption, mutual benefit, legislation where virtually everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that the state ministries, due to lack of financial resources, entrust the development of draft laws to private law firms that are closely connected with industry.
Then the Bundestag approves these bills.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitution says, but from financial-powerful groups that prioritize their own interests.
Clearly, liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly falling into the situation described by Appian in The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long since fallen apart, and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribery, illegal charity using stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibition, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote""... decent people did not run for governor at all, eventually one day the state was left without a consul for eight months"... .. "It was seriously talked about that the only salvation from this terrible situation was autocracy and the need to choose an energetic man"..
As in ancient times, today's society is dominated by self-interest without regard for the public interest.
Private capital is no longer essentially intended for public use.
The result is no different: an unprecedented decline of the elite without any attempt to bring about more profound reforms.
So the reason for the rise of fascist and communist regimes is to be found in the reckless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be seen as a pause, after which the next round is expected.
The first tragedy is that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity as we know from old and new history.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under pressure from competition at both international, national and European levels, the Czech government will be forced to continue to look for ways to further lower the social standard of the population.
This trend is thus systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state's share of the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: The lab of chaos.
"Nothing comes out of violence, and it never can". Sting, "Fragile", where the main verse of the chorus is "Don't forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want wars, there wouldn't be any". - The dying Guthel Schnapper, wife of Meir Amschel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza has, as always, provoked a lot of reactions.
Some are for Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians are playing the role of terrorists, while others support the Palestinians, arguing that it is the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and the role of the state of Israel as a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who is the perpetrator and who is the victim in these periodic waves of killing, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation, and did not witness the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to see who is primarily served by the 95 years of tension (since the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is backed up by historical facts, some of it is based on my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of power struggles.
In every age, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
It is not clear whether these men always took their own steps or whether someone was behind their throne directing their actions toward pre-established goals.
We must assume that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes with it could not happen in the lifetime of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families, one that could be considered the head of the family (I don't know if anyone is above them, but it's possible) is the Rothschilds.
They don't get much coverage.
Of course I can.
They bought the first news agency, Reuters, back in the 1890s to stop the rumors that linked their name to criminal activities in the higher realms that they were in the shadow of, and that always led to their strengthening of power, their increasing wealth, or both.
They have large stakes in almost all the world's central banks, and they are waging or preparing war against countries whose central banks they do not own (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian government took over the central bank of their country).
Anyone who tried to resist this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to keep the central bank status of the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began issuing his own (understand - government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater.
John F. Kennedy began issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (the Federal Reserve System), but was assassinated in 1963.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars, devised by the great 33rd degree Mason Albert Pike.
The first war was to destroy the monarchical states in Europe, the second to destroy colonial rule, especially Great Britain, and the third to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (this number of slaves would be enough to provide them with comfort and luxury, and they would not consume many resources), create a single universal religion (ecumenism could be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and finally seize absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families led by the Rothschilds work is to call for a crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the reasoning of the FED, which was to prevent a recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they succeeded in unleashing World War I by assassinating the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia, starting the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, unjustified capitulation of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, the fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation by imposing huge military reparations on Germany, creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it was only left to throw the Germans a strong enough Leader, exposing the guilty and offering simple solutions, then to create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and really played, the function of the fifth column, in fanning the flames of the war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the prerequisites for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
When World War II broke out, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had broken free from the chains that had originally held him captive by the bankers, or whether everything he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed for a third war.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people will be the victims of the fighting on the front lines, as they were in World War II, now along with the Arab or, to put it more simply, Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country but also internationally (just to mention the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the victim and who is the culprit in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their quest for world power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the ordinary people of Israel and their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are giving people to vote in elections exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker politician who does everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran's control over the Strait of Hormuz, containing 20% of all world oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), - will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
How are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 now being expressed: "All we need is a common crisis and people will accept a new world order"?
The New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population is served by a handful of financial aristocrats enjoying their comfort.
A world where every newborn organism is implanted with a chip at birth, which makes them a totally controlled being.
"And it causes all to buy or sell, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, the name of the wild beast or the number of its name.
This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and its number is six hundred and sixty-six.
When the going gets tough, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student protesters seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled the revolution to the United States, which had been a patron of his regime for decades.
The U.S. administration was not expected to make a positive outcome -- it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the trust of allies in other countries.
However, she was unable to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later compounded by the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
Directed by actor Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo" is a story that brings America small victories.
Shortly before the embassy was occupied, six employees managed to escape.
After a difficult journey, they ended up at the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, aided by an extravagant cover story that they had travelled to Canada on Canadian passports as part of a film crew looking for a location to shoot a science fiction epic.
Mix of genres
The plan, devised by evacuation expert Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend true, specialized magazines wrote about the film project, held press conferences, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special blend of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, a so-called "movie-movie", a story of a successful scheme, a scam - an example of this is a series of films about Oushen's friends.
The film is constantly changing moods - on the one hand, documentary scenes from Tehran (titles show iconic historical photos of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the Hollywood reliefs, interspersed with irony and a mild exaggeration.
And then there's scenes from the CIA headquarters and other facilities, men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of the facilities, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable career reboot.
A mocked actor became a respected director, and his performance ceased to be the object of ridicule.
Operation Argo is his third feature film, following the dark detective Goodbye, Baby, Goodbye (2007) and the thriller The City (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film not to be shot in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of place is a quality that elevated the director's earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows that in Argo, where Tehran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, with real-life reconstructions - the opening scenes of the embassy falling are striking in their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when somewhere the story suddenly changes.
Afflek and his colleagues achieve a similar effect in the scenes of the fictional (a fake headquarters in a Tehran bazaar).
Too many trials in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative didn't involve many cinematically significant, exciting scenes.
He works pretty well with that few, sometimes he comes up with something - it doesn't work out so elegantly there (the scene where a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at Tehran airport, and the runway chase looks pretty fanciful).
The downside of Argo is the distraction of having to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are really very charming as Hollywood colleagues, but their characters deserve more space, and they're not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of drama, and it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciating the production and retro style that recreates the thrillers of the 1970s.
But it's hard to capture.
However, this is enough to remind us of one still alive story, and to show how exaggerated the notion of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence is.
Rules for blowing up balloons, bananas and circuses
The website www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to launch a contest for "the most absurd resolution or project from the EU workshop".
"We were inspired by the recent EU proposal to introduce a 40% quota for women on the boards of major European companies", said Patrick Nager, a poll organiser for the right.
Among the absurdities already proposed is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rates of insurance contributions for men and women.
So far, women have had benefits on life insurance because they are objectively less at risk to insurance companies.
"The next incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be submitted to the competition before the end of the year.
The voting itself will be held until the end of February 2013", Nager said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of bio-components to fuel, which in turn harms the environment, and a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively few dangerous substances, or the chicken cage size directive, which has caused eggs to rise significantly in price this year.
The ban on the use of the term "sandwich butter" or the withdrawal of classic light bulbs from sale has also been criticized.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The European Union's decision-making apparatus is often under pressure from a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic now even under threat of veto defends its banks' demands).
The lobby's interests are as follows: for example, the highest quality bananas in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and not dare to show "anomalous curvature".
The European Commission has justified this by saying that it is only harmonizing the existing fragmented national rules that have complicated trade.
The EU, despite resistance from some states, has softened standards for fruit and vegetables, citing that existing directives will lead to food waste.
Last year's EU regulation, which requires balloons to be marked with a warning that children under eight cannot blow them up without adult supervision, could be a contender.
The EU has referred to US studies that show balloons in play are a potential cause of child death by suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 who are not allowed to blow into the carnival carnival.
Funny ideas come from home .
The rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: anyone holding any official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name Macedonia, but must instead say "BYRM" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the liberal economists' association Laissez Faire, has proposed a vote on a number of absurd rules, including the EU's food stocks rule.
The EU has set a maximum amount of food stocks that can be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the prescribed quantities of canned mushrooms, for which it was subject to a large fine.
The survey was also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of granting subsidies to applicants for subsidies.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation", said then-agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (CPSU) in the fall of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full stocks of stocks that needed to be taken out.
Because the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission has therefore decided to hold a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidies for the subsidy were offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemts (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to go to the application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Fantastic orders are an exception
While the regulations in the Member States are easily criticized, the EU's efforts to regulate and make the EU work and grow more effectively are, in the view of many experts, more deserving of recognition.
A major problem, experts say, is the use of EU subsidies for projects that have no hint of deepening European integration, but which the member states have achieved in their budget discussions.
The Czech Republic, like other EU countries, is also raising the stakes in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win the contest.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, retained the name "Olomoutsky cheese", however, the "Tuzem rum", whose traditions in our country go back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename it "Tuzemak".
Only products made from cane distillate, not sugar beet, can be called rum.
The official EU list of registered products, alongside the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from the German city of Lübeck or Parma ham, already includes, for example, Karlovy Vary dry curries, Gorzhelsky and Trshebon carp and Zhatetsk hops.
The European Union also has a trademark for Pardubice pepper and Gorjic pipes.
People want me to protect the republic, but I am an amateur", Okamura claims.
Senator, how does a man get the idea to run for president?
I'm not thinking about becoming a senator or president myself.
If we had a country that was functioning smoothly, I wouldn't be running for office.
But I can't stand to see the country get robbed over the last 20 years, the thieves come running, people get tax increases and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and an independent, nonpartisan man, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but you soon went to the presidential palace.
Do you not turn your back on the people who elected you?
I've always said I'd get involved in the presidential castle fight depending on the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, the position is a tool with which I can implement my views.
That's why I need the most influence and the broadest authority.
But the difficulty is not just that we as a nation are grumbling in our bars or on our TVs, but that we are willing to trample anyone who tries to make a difference.
Add to that the media that smears people and confuses free speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was accused of bribing journalists or being an adviser to Irzy Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
You started the fight for the presidential palace with the theses about the financial and criminal liability of politicians and about the return of property declarations worth more than twenty million.
To do that, the law needs to be changed.
You, as president, do not have that authority, and only the full Senate can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I lobbied as a citizen to make touring a free enterprise, it got a lot of traction.
The problem with politics is that when someone comes with a good proposal, whether it's from the left or the right, they're deliberately blocked, and that holds back citizens.
As an independent non-party person, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without partisan shelf-shaping, without looking at dogma, I can take from each party what's best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing or left-wing person?
From a Czech perspective, I think people tend to think of me as more of a leftist.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not about right or left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good solution for society, whether it is proposed by the CCP or the GDP, and I will be just as opposed to a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you say?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some ideal goals and visions.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You could call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already in place in the world, or are being talked about by leading experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you'll be left with slogans.
And you won't last long in politics with that.
Or do you think that when you go out and talk to people, you can actually realize the criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side so we get what we want.
If I were elected president, I would have no problem organizing a live television broadcast in which I would address the chairmen of parliamentary parties and call for the legalization of financial and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they'll have to tell us why they don't want to.
If there's a strong person who can speak out about the abuse, then you can put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct presidential election -- it was a public pressure.
I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and beliefs.
I'm just starting out in politics, and I'm going to try to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm trying to run my own business, and if that doesn't work, I'll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura's supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can't do anything alone, so I've passed up a number of famous people to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchur, he refused because of the volume of work.
I also at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorentzova, who exposed a fraud involving light fuel petroleum products.
I ran because people are really unhappy, but I feel like I'm on the scale.
Sixty percent of the people didn't vote, and most of those who did did voted for the establishment.
There are only two of us independents in the Senate.
The people elected the Senate in a way that will make change difficult to implement.
I will fight for my views, however, for direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking of starting your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet because I don't have time to check the purity of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money.
I have no money for the presidential campaign, only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
Don't you have any money?
You talk about property returns, but how are your own affairs with that?
His personal fortune is estimated at approximately $60 million.
I have a plot of land in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, an art collection for about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb for a million, and a few more millions on the balance sheet.
And by the way, I got an Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream -- I always liked James Bond, who drove a car and was gallant with women and at the same time fought against mean and lawlessness.
You drive an Aston Martin, you own $60 million in property and you don't have campaign funds?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million dollars for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into this campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors suggests that my program isn't that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my own pocket.
My campaign expenses will be covered by my senate salary.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, I couldn't pay for my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I was just trying to make money, I wouldn't be running.
So you're going to keep doing business to make a living?
Didn't you say you were going to cut back on this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the salary.
As I promised, I've partially scaled back my activities.
For example, my deputy will be the managing director of a travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be the lowlife who keeps the republic safe.
But I need something to live for, too.
How much do you usually make as an entrepreneur?
From 200 to 400 grand, which I keep getting.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.

MVRDV architects prove that real adventures don't just happen in the imagination - with Spekennisse and his newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think it's fun, it looks futuristic, we finally have something interesting to see again", says Lisette Verhaig, walking alongside the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large factory, says, "No, this building is really beautiful".
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPads and e-books.
No one volunteers to go to these old-fashioned libraries anymore, right?
Speikennis, a small sleeping town near Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education by building seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on the euro banknotes as beautifully painted miniature concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers realized that the only way they could beat statistics was to build a library here!
Vini Maas of the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, a master of bold column diagrams and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical constructions, approached the task with his usual calmness and appeared at the 2003 competition audition with five books under his nose and a smile on his face.
And while the judges looked around in bewilderment and shouldered each other, the bold Maas folded his original gift into a pyramid-sized piece and concluded his speech in defense of his project with the words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my offer: the Book Mountain in Speckenness, the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain has grown to a value of 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground garage, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential buildings and townhouses totaling 50 apartments.
In early November, "The Book Mountain" was awarded the second prize of the "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012" competition.
The project also participates in the Dutch national wood construction competition 2012.
Thus, a faceless suburb that had previously offered nothing but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall, whose white facades remind one of a dairy, became richer for one modern architectural work.
But most importantly, Speikennis has the first public building of cultural significance in the history of this town.
It 's a long way to the book .
First impression: the Eldorado book under the cheese cap.
There is only one elevator that goes through the center of the mountain range, and true architectural and reading lovers will prefer to explore the area on foot.
The glass-enclosed room is bright and easy to see, the brick floors and elegant street lamps give the impression of a public square.
The urban environment is perfectly recreated.
The eye is unwittingly looking for benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And there are books, books, books everywhere.
"The bookshelves are usually along the facades, and in the middle is a large, dark room, usually uncomfortable and faceless", says Vinnie Maas.
We've put the classic head-to-toe configuration of the space and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the book mountain is used skillfully: in the center there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical premises.
Black bookshelves, which are used as walls, parapets, and staircases, are especially appealing.
Their appearance, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and civil engineers are at a loss to guess what this unknown material is.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials", explains Yop Trauborst, the project manager representing the community of Speikennis, in line with the standard.
And once, at a farm in Friesland, we found a suitable agricultural byproduct.
For many years, artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness has been used as a substrate in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and it saves time.
Thin textiles last one or two seasons, then they're disposable.
For the library, this canvas - the first of its kind in this size - was pressed into a four-centimeter-thick panel.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called KLP turns into a dark, uniform, durable material that smells a little like a new car and a little like a sneaker.
There are 105 steps to the top.
The literary café will reward those who make the nearly half-mile trek with a fantastic view of the city as well as Dutch croquettes and wood-fired ficuses.
They care about the atmosphere, and especially the right humidity on the literary mountain.
Cost per new person
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is an exemplary ecological project", says Trooborst.
It uses the earth's heat to heat and cool it.
Although Book Mountain is under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun only shines briefly.
The wide, glued-wood farms, perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
The atmosphere in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Litte Verhaeg has been here before.
And also traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who called Buchenberg "the soul of Speakenness that has long been missing".
The reason: In the weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to donate one book from his own congregation.
These books were to fill the empty shelves of a library that was not yet fully stocked - at that time, it had 70,000 books.
It worked.
The shelves are forced up.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library", says architect Vinnie Maas.
"I think that with our invitation, every resident is now somehow connected to this new home.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
So MVRDV has solved a royal challenge, which in professional jargon is called identity creation.
Speakennisse wrote his literary history.
And they're very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for building identity.
Szabo: "Germans should play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on recognizing Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinians' application for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why? Why?
Stefan Szabo: Germany does not support the Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany must be careful now about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think she doesn't support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the no-fly zone.
NATO eventually made the offer.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stand on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, from the policy which the United States, so to speak, was leading, to the German foreign policy itself.
The situation is further complicated by the lack of a common policy among Europeans.
Thus, the Germans are again caught between two fronts.
They're expected to play a more independent role, but they're not used to it.
I believe they are just getting a feel for their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
The kind of foreign policy that France or Britain have.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It is a willingness to take a position in our national interest that is independent of the position of the United States or our European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are very different from those of other major powers, and Germany must therefore defend its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Gulf.
So she needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elites in the Arab countries.
Either way, it's playing a role.
But I wouldn't put too much pressure on it, it's not a one-way street.
But in any case, it plays a big part in the German calculations.
Did Germany hurt its relationship with the United States by abstaining from important decisions like the vote on Palestine?
I'm sure that in Europe and even in the United States, there is a predominant understanding of the German position.
So I don't think it was as dramatic a blow as the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect.
It is a signal that it should be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has been clear in its veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has a deep understanding of the European position.
But given the local political situation, the government cannot, of course, openly take such a position.
I believe that the substantial differences of opinion are not at all as significant as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you'll see that Obama is not very happy with Netanyahu's policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and its position as a key partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a unified, consistent European policy, but that's not the case now.
So they cannot speak within the framework of a broader approach and are forced to act instead based on their own vision of the situation.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I think that Germany will take a leading role in the development of a common European position in the future.
It's not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties to Israel.
It's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans understand that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not take on a really major role?
Or is the lead still hard for Germany?
Germany is not yet used to this, it is still always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Take, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes a leading role, there are all sorts of anti-German sentiments.
It's not easy for the Germans to handle.
Actually, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much worse position than the United States.
She has to take into account the many different neighbors and opinions, and that's not easy.
So the influence of the United States in European politics is constantly declining, but at this point, the EU is not filling the vacuum, so who is left?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, or it's unpleasant, or it's just making you feel unloved, that's life!

"Trademark protection in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese"
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is too.
But what is Armani Polo?
It's a completely registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies that gave it its name.
However, it will be protected until the original names are sued.
But even then, it's not clear if they'll be able to defend their rights.
"It's getting harder and harder for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China", says Thomas Patloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, which specializes in trademark infringement in the Far East.
I get a new case like this on my desk every week.
For example, a copycat may add a few letters to a trademark.
So Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
German companies, such as sports goods manufacturer Puma, are being legally copied in the same way.
Patloch opens a file with records from the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an artificial name that also used the name of the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing on intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities, there are department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeit goods.
But Patloch's case is not that, and he is opposed to Chinese companies being given a license from the trademark office to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it a ban minpai, a passenger car.
This word is associated with "ban daquan".
That's what they call a woman who goes after rich men.
Chinese authorities deny any responsibility
"It's hurting business and it needs to be tackled", Patloch said.
"The brand is fading, the unique position is lost, the image is suffering very badly".
The financial losses and legal costs in the affected industries are estimated to be in the millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market with annual sales of 15 billion euros.
However, removing questionable trademarks is difficult and expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with no clear outcome.
Patloch tells of cases in which the court rejected lawsuits because the name was "market reality" after a long time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist for damaging his trademark in China, says Patloch.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, an enterprise that had recently acquired concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
So the Chinese still have the right to use the Mercedes star-like emblem.
The company that bought Volvo Geely initially used a blue-white logo, reminiscent of BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashion goods maker Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be responsible.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties due to a lack of staff and equipment in the premises.
But last year saw a "return to normalcy from a workplace emergency".
The number of unresolved objections decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, a 75 percent increase over last year.
Still, 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
It costs a lot to fight it.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has topped the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the ministry said.
The same is true of the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
Simply put, this means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
The cost of protesting is far greater, as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans succeeded in eliminating their illegal production of counterfeit car parts.
However, the imitator secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was a mistake on his part, since surnames are not protected in Germany, says Hannho Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trademark office has rejected the Munichers' claim.
True, Freudenberg won both subsequent trials, but the other side continues to fight until now.
We need to be vigilant .
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a successful conclusion and praises the courts' professionalism.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money, and nerve".
Internal costs are hardly accounted for, the firm's archives even had to go through records from a century ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing side "a large six-figure sum in euros" for a settlement, but to no avail.
"It's clear how expensive this is", says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spill over into Europe.
Especially if the copycats register unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.
The concern has long stopped production in these areas, but it has managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be on guard", says Wentzler.
Both he and Patloch advise German companies to be very careful with China.
Rather than relying on international trademark laws, foreigners should "register anything worth protecting in China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could cost a lot more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposing party royalties for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we'll be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Stomp, sing, and help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongis rehearse, and in Swaziland, the AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of a relationship that spanned over 8,733 kilometers.
First, the water is poured out: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's boots, and men's slippers pick up the pace on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the singers' voices slowly build - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they step forward, charm and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his matte shoes as he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday night, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongis' choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty choir members, ranging in age from 23 to 69, came to the rehearsal, from a human genetics specialist to a janitor.
Om'Obani is a complex song, with each voice having a different text, and in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to the United Nations AIDS program, there are an estimated 34 million people worldwide living with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
Voices for Africa has found leaders in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in Essien Village.
70 of them are in a school that prepares them for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over the chef's job.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniform and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongyi is Zulu for storyteller or praiser.
This room doesn't speak Bantu fluently, but they can sing.
For nearly a decade, the choir has been learning songs in this foreign soft language and even occasionally returns them to their original home in southern Africa.
For some 5,500 miles [8,733 km] from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, lies the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected .
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, and many children.
More than 300 of them lost their parents to HIV.
Esitijeni is a miniature of the disease of Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which has been shown to cut the risk of infection in half, is almost unheard of in the general population.
More than 40 percent of Swaziland's population is infected with the immunodeficiency virus, and deaths in the mid-to-late 40s are not uncommon.
The choir opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, the Imbogni participants saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment by the individual participants - for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to give him the opportunity to have a hot meal once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, which has since become a professional organization that cares for AIDS orphans in Eswatini.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important STDs?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and trippera (gonorrhea).
HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and hepatitis are common viral STIs.
Bald foot and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are most common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candidiasis, gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The HIV prevalence among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but they account for about 20 percent of new HIV infections.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among young people than among other groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also have a lot of human papillomavirus among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required to be registered.
Syphilis incidence, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than last year.
What are the symptoms of an STD?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, urinary complaints, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, and blisters or lumps.
However, they often go unnoticed and are not accompanied by pain or other symptoms.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they don't provide 100 percent protection.
Some sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread by contact and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular check-ups, especially if you frequently change sexual partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and prevent long-term consequences.
The management, donations and, not least, the fees for choir performances throughout Germany allow us to collect something.
"We have already sent some €200,000 to Essien", says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, the money from Germany is managed by Tsodva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well taken care of, for example by one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the Zulu call old women, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, providing them with a roof over their heads and ensuring that the children in uniform show up for school on time every day.
Those who have no relatives are taken to the shelter by Hanysila, a single woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
Voices for Africa also organized a sewing school, built two chicken coop and, in partnership with the American health organization PSI, provided HIV testing for many of the villagers.
It's hard to imagine, but a disease so evident across the country, people are deeply silent.
A king with 14 wives.
"AIDS is an absolute taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it is about sexuality".
Quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, this state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent years.
But it also lies with the vagrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The other culture is flesh and blood".
To promote cultural exchange, the Ibmogny Choir travels to southern Africa every two to three years and sings songs of sadness, militancy, confidence and black self-awareness that many in the southern tip of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in black - not only does this recognition bring good cheer and joy, but it has even occasionally brought tears to the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip always leads to Esijeni, where the singers visit their children.
Although the small village is hard to find on a map, it is more than famous in the Etsulveni River valley.
"Go to Estigny, there is light", the people say.
And after the 8,733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when the thunderous singers return to the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Street, you can see that light is also burning here.
NASA is discovering ice on Mercury .
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet can be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is the closest to the sun, it also contains frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that the planet's permanently shadowed region is covered in ice.
It should be at least a foot [30 cm] thick, perhaps up to 65 feet [20 m].
Supposedly, the water came from a comet or maybe an asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one has linked the discovery of ice to life on the planet, said the probe's scientific director, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other places in the solar system.
Unseen by humans, probes, telescopes, and small robots, such as the Phoenix, are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images back to Earth: little windows in infinite spaces.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" as defined by the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This fragment of the Spitzer infrared image is a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, the more difficult to identify in the star circle are the pink "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region -- scientists casually call it W5 -- was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This superheated death star was photographed by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The doughnut-like ring is made of material that a star discarded during its dying process.
In the giant nebula of the Triffids, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are being formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope took this picture of the galactic birthing room.
The Pleiades, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope, the color is better.
Like a red eye blinking to the observer, the Owl Nebula in this infrared image.
It's located 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
The similarity to the Earth's continent has earned it the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides a vivid color rendering.
This new star in all its beauty was photographed only with the help of the Spitzer telescope's infrared sensors.
Saturn and its rings: How they came into existence is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be fragments of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and clearest images ever taken by the Hubble telescope: the vortex galaxy.
Depending on the color rendering, the images of spiral galaxies become works of art.
A picture published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-part), as the dark bands of dust divide the hot heart of the star's cradle into three parts.
In the constellation of Serpent, astronomers have photographed a harbinger of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are drifting toward each other and will inevitably collide.
This is the birth of a star captured by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can call it the Southern Tube Wheel.
A photograph taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was made from optical and X-ray images taken by various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
The large spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This stellar nebula contains the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star crib is constantly creating new stars.
This star cloud, combined with the Rosetta Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars - 5,000 light-years from Earth.
This bright galaxy with a small black hole doesn't have any dust yet, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our View of the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgay - before Galileo Galilei began to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown larger and larger, and the space available to them has become deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror pictured here was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope is installed.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias has a gigantic internal device - a mirror alone measures 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to reduce cost.
Nevertheless, it reaches about 11 meters in diameter.
The disadvantage of low-cost construction: the telescope is rigidly fixed at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its peculiarity is its high light-gathering ability.
It reaches - despite its comparatively small mirror diameter - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening for extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by contributing their computing power.
A view of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
It's called the Very Large Telescope, which is exactly what it says.
Its four mirrors allow even the medium infrared spectrum to be illuminated in the visual tube.
The European Very Large Telescope is also planned to be installed at ESO's Chilean observatory.
Its main mirror will be as wide as 138 feet [42 m] - and will be made up of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photos should be expected no earlier than 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors, each ten metres in diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks at the sky with the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope with a 30-meter-diameter mirror is to be built on Mauna Kea.
You can see them in the illustrations.
However, the most important images from space are supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been supplying paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for planets outside our solar system - primarily those that support life.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the mission began.
The photograph shows the final preparations for the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched in 2018 on board the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search the light of the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, since the "Messenger" is orbiting closer to the planet's north pole.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that Mercury has ice.
Thanks to the 2004 launch of the first probe to orbit Mercury, the Messenger, scientists are now convinced of this.
Drink oil every day and live to 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the age of respectability that is Biblical.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
A puzzle in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the age of respectability that is Biblical.

A puzzle in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
The ride through the Talish Mountains is wild and romantic.
A minibus roars along a winding road past dense forested hills, raging rivers, and simple peasant houses.
Everything is so green and bright, you'd think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the southernmost tip of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
The Talish people live here, a Caucasian people about whom little is known except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani fluently and are long-lived.
The end point is Lirik.
The small town boasts of too heavy a Soviet-era architecture that is completely out of harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
It takes eight hours to travel 200 miles [323 km] because the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the Caspian oil, has not yet reached here, in the province.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerica.
"In May, Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will have the world's oldest people festival", says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here is a biography of about eight dozen tallas from these places, which are over 100 years old.
That's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136 he had another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Shirali Muslyumov, who is supposedly 168 years old.
No birth certificate, though.
And given that the oldest person whose age is documented is 122 years old, M. Muslumov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973", Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
So did shepherd Muslims add a couple of decades to his age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of longevity in Central Asia.
"There are also surprising numbers of elderly people in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "and there are also extremely large numbers of very old people in Sardinia".
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is impossible, as there were no civil status registers.
A glass of melted butter every day .
Nevertheless, the fact remains that people in the area of Lerique are surprisingly often reaching the Biblical age.
Now there are 20 people over 100 living here.
Why are there so many long-livers here in the South?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mughimzade explains this by the special genes of the tallies.
The museum director, Fatulayev, on the other hand, believes it's about food.
The Talish people like meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day.
In Chengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzoyev.
At 97, she's still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and daughter, who have grandchildren.
There are also two children jumping nearby.
In the kitchen, guests are served tea in typical puzzled cups of pomegranate.
Mirzaeva has perfectly straight and strong white teeth, and under her headscarf she hides long dark-reddish hair, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always wash my hair with milk so it never falls out and retains its color.
"I have never used shampoo", says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live on
She always ate only what grew in her own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought groceries in my life.
Then she tells about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was after World War II.
But it got better when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev got up at the wheel.
Propaganda is not often heard in an old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan practically knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
Yet, there is no poverty among the elderly in Azerbaijan.
Mirzaev receives 230 manats (about the same amount of euros) as a monthly pension, which is a good living for the local conditions.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-grown son is right: "The elderly are deeply respected in our culture".
They live in a big family, loving, caring, and happy.
No reason to stay alive as long as possible .
The word "human right" is not in the constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo are a testament to the deep division in the country.
The future constitution, based on Sharia, met fierce opposition.
The Egyptian president didn't shy away from paphos.
We need to create a transition.
"And its success lies in my responsibility to the people and to God", he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
Because all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi, almost apologizing, said he had temporarily curtailed the jurisdiction of the constitutional court and expanded its jurisdiction "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the University of Southern California, really wants to save is not clear to Egyptians and the world.
Will the judicial system be stripped of its power?
In fact, 234 articles were pulled in a 15-hour night of obstacles at an Islamist-oriented constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly concerning.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the judiciary is based on "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and remains a matter of interpretation, and one can fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal loophole to interpret the Shari'ah more strictly.
At least, one new article suggests that in all matters involving Sharia, Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution and a major authority in Sunni Islam, should be consulted.
It shouldn't, but it could mean that the clergy is overseeing the legislation, which would de facto result in a curtailment of the judiciary.
The draft Constitution is a matter of interpretation .
Another problem is that civilians must remain subject to military courts.
These courts were used to suppress opposition during Mubarak's rule.
After the dictator's overthrow, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The draft also states that the state must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "support its morals and values".
Legally, it is so vague that government agencies can even control the content of movies and literature through this article.
In the open text, that means nothing but censorship.
There is no article that directly establishes equality between men and women.
The other prohibits insulting and vilifying the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording that "insulting people" is forbidden is also questionable.
Will cartoons of the president or jokes about the lawman be enough?
The question of interpretation, like much of the draft, which Morsi is proposing for signature and which he says will be submitted to Egyptians for a referendum "very soon".
"The revolution is back"
For weeks, opposition has been building against the Islamist supremacy.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unity on Friday night in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the document before it could take effect.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbah, who finished third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said the draft constitution had a place "in the dustbin of history".
Through his Twitter short news service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him", said opposition figure Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet avenged", opposition politician Khaled Ali was quoted by Egyptian media as saying.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would have made it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for a counter-demonstration, but not in Tahrir Square as a precaution, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women in veils and Salafists who shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law".
They demanded Morsi to "clean the country" and assured him that "the Koran is our constitution".
The struggle for power over the symbolic square where it all began has provoked a state of near-civil war.
Morsi's followers clearly didn't want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
Now it's time to let the people decide at the ballot box which way the country should go.
The majority is for the Islamist project, it's considered a done deal.
"The concept of 'human rights' is not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Said is furious at this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHRO) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in jail or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights were indivisible to him.
For that, he was beaten, convicted, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are not found in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's expansion of influence into all three branches of government in the state is disappointing to the lawyer.
These measures are a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president de facto abolished it", regrets Saeed.
Because without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Sayeda feels abandoned, even by the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile's two sides with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be a price to pay.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are creating a monster you cannot control".
Norwegian shrimp: the world's worst-smelling fish?
With a population of five million, Norway has one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Perhaps the secret to this country's success is somehow tied to the local addiction to one extremely foul-smelling fish dish?
Have some overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty, sweaty tracksuits.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll get the stunning scent of shrimp, one of Norway's most famous delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but the air has an indelible smell.
The shark is a trout that is salted and left to roam in the water for up to a year, depending on what kind of breathing you want to achieve.
As the sun sets and the weather gets colder, crowds of Norwegians gather at the festival in Fagernes, dedicated to this most fascinating dish.
"It is eaten raw and drunk with a sip of aquavita, the local tin vodka", explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter and a part-time racketeer general who oversees the festival.
All around us, people eat fish that is cut into small cubes and drunk in large quantities of alcohol.
"Some people prefer sea bass to shrimp", says Howard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can get a piece under your nose, it's not so bad - it's not much different from a portion of sushi you've been carrying around on the bus for a long time.
Rackfish is a Norwegian product from a very different time, a time of poverty, when, even before refrigerators, fish were soaked in sealed barrels of salt water in the fall.
Then, in the depths of winter, when the fish had fully matured, they would be taken out and, after being diluted with alcohol, consumed as food.
The fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, mainly to the United States, is still in the memory of the last generation.
Now, the population is growing rapidly, with more than 13 percent of immigrants drawn by jobs, high wages, and a well-developed welfare system.
Swedes (the old rival, and not so long ago, a much more prosperous neighbor) are coming here in droves to work.
The rackfish is seen as an important symbol, an essential, albeit somewhat foul-smelling, element of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9.
Norway is rarely in the news, and most people seem to be fine with that.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called "the 22nd of July".
It is hard for the Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country, one of their fellow citizens would be capable of such atrocities and murder.
Norway's prosperity today is based on the growth (since the early seventies) of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason we are prosperous", says Anna, our waitress who delivers the trays of seasoned rackfish, a woman with long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, the epitome of Nordic prosperity.
We are a people, as you call it, of reason.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English perfectly.
We don't like to show off, we don't brag.
Norway is very careful with its oil - much of the oil and gas industry's revenue is invested in a special fund for future generations.
In the years before the global financial crisis, when everyone was scrambling for money they didn't have, Norway was careful to calculate all the costs.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and go camping in the summer, that's enough to make you happy", says Anna.
"And there's the shrimp", she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food. I'm done with shrimp.
Here's a moose burger. It's definitely exotic, and it's delicious juicy meat.
But tonight, we're gonna have more of the same fish with the same unforgettable scent.
My hotel has a special shrimp dinner where guests vote on the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
It's live, and it shows the host in a bow tie surrounded by a rack of fish.
It's like the Eurovision song contest.
"So, Thor-Jurgen, what was your rating on the best fish in your mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here is our rating"...
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling out of a chair, probably overdosing on the aquaphobia.
Or maybe just by breathing in the smell of that fish.
President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico is about to have a rough start to his career.
As Mexico's newly elected president Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the challenges he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's people.
Traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly dire state.
The city is overcrowded with traffic at its best, and since Monday, steel barriers have been erected, cutting off several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, Mexico's new president Enrique Peña Nieto will don the presidential armband and take over the reins of government.
He has a difficult task.
Mexico has had a good economic record under the administration of Felipe Calderón, who is now in office, but the country is mired in a war on drugs that has claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government is declaring to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence", Mr. Peña Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House earlier this week.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Prior to his comments, Mr. Peña Nieto's political career alongside the President of the United States had been as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, a densely populated and sprawling state surrounding the nation's capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
A straight man .
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, he is remembered fondly.
The residents credit him with reviving tourism, developing the resort sector and creating infrastructure.
The city is accessible by one of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which are quite different from the roads with ditches and ditches that used to be on the site.
His name is on the modern sports center building and the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We attach to him the hope of real and serious change", says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman for the Peña Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect the real and decisive changes that our country so desperately needs, first and foremost in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous rule, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also denies the accusations of incompetence that the opposition has leveled against the new president.
He's very forthright and very committed to his vision for the future of this country.
He's a great statesman, and above all, a good listener.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nessaualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad-Nesa, is a striking contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the overpass of the highways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also the harsh nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, troops were deployed to quell drug gangs in these areas, where violence against women is particularly acute.
In the last two years alone, dozens of women's bodies have been found in a wasteland near a massive dump.
More than a thousand women were murdered in Mexico during the governorship of Mr. Peña Nieto - far more than in the notorious violent city of Ciudad Juarez, which has become a household name when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to Mr. Peña Nieto's opponents, he was at best described as having failed to address the issue of female murder during his time as governor.
At worst, his administration is accused of ignoring the problem.
Irineia Buendia, a resident of a concrete house like most in this dilapidated neighborhood, is having a hard time holding back her tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her roommate killed her.
"When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed", recalls Buendia.
There were signs of a beating, and the body was already bruised.
Mariana's mother tells the story, and her daughter's portrait looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to a crucifix that has only one word on it: justice.
That, they say, is what this family was denied.
"The state officials treated me like an old gossip, a disgruntled troublemaker.
They want people to just take what they say and shut up.
But it's wrong, it's not right, especially when there are so many violations and flaws", she says.
By taking the presidential apron on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
Tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime in the past six years, and the new president has promised to make addressing the problem a priority during his term.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as he was as governor", says Olvera, a PRI congressman from Valle de Bravo.
But that's what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nesa fear most.
Bradley Manning has no complaints of ill-treatment, the prosecution says.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's claims about poor conditions in custody.
The hearing focused on Manning's time in the military prison at Quantico, Virginia.
The defense is demanding that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's conditions were harsh.
The U.S. Army is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution sought to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, failed to take advantage of the many opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he said he had suffered while in military prison.
During cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein stated that records of Manning's weekly visits by prison officials during his nine months in Quantico, Virginia, contained no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of the defense's motion to dismiss Manning's case on the grounds that the conditions of his confinement were cruel and sufficient punishment in themselves was held the day after Manning stated that while in custody, he intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were later published online on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed that Manning was the source.
During Friday's hearing, prosecutor Fein reviewed with Manning the reports that were completed after Manning was visited by administration officials during his time in Quantico, where he was held in strict conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Fein asked on Friday about the reports, Manning admitted that he considered the prison administration's treatment of him "excellent" and the general conditions of detention "very professionally organized".
The reviewed reports contain no complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manning being asked explicitly about the conditions of his detention, Fein claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally about these problems and that administration officials who had visited him had discussed them with him and said they would address them, but had not recorded this in writing.
"They wrote 'no problems' (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't bring it up in the conversation", Manning says.
A military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained of mistreatment in January 2011 during a committee hearing on suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing months earlier.
Manning replied that during that hearing he wanted to get his "trauma prevention" regime lifted and his conditions eased.
Military officials explained that the limited detention regime - a level lower than the suicide prevention surveillance regime - was introduced to protect the prisoner as well as the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I was fine, that they would cancel the injury prevention regime... that my standard of living would improve, from my point of view", Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a prison at the Naval Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had suicidal thoughts in Kuwait and that he had once fainted in the heat.
He explained that it's very difficult psychologically when you're not allowed to know how your destiny is decided and what's going on in the outside world.
"My world has shrunk to the size of Camp Arifjan, to the size of my prison", Manning said Thursday.
- I thought I was going to die in this cage".
While at Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day - in complete solitude.
Manning reports that he was only allowed to leave behind a mattress, a blanket, slippers, a few items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move because sleeping or even just lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning said that during his sleep, he was constantly being struck by light coming from outside the chamber.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned in bed at night, he said they woke him up and made him turn on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning's mistreatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about a statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that after being forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates at the morning checkpoint.
Manning said he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
In response to questions from the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he should throw away a blanket he could cover himself with, but admitted that no one had directly ordered him to throw it.
On Thursday, Manning said he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that he was no danger to himself.
Manning reported telling an officer he could have used a rubber band or a pair of panties to injure himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, slippers and glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take into account his experience in prison and substantially reduce his sentence if Manning is found guilty by a military court, which is due to begin hearing his case early next year.
The defense said it planned to offer Manning a plea to lesser charges and challenge the other charges as excessive.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend, with the prosecution expected to insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held at Quantico under the strictest detention rules.
Among the charges brought against Manning are aiding and abetting an enemy, illegal facilitation of the publication of data on the Internet, transmission of information concerning national defense, and theft of public property or documents.
If convicted on all counts, he could face life in prison.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of a Mexican-American.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to fulfill themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of the difficult times.
Ruben Navarrete believes that Mexican Americans are torn between two cultures.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the arrivals corridor, approached the border checkpoint, and froze.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood there for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called a Mexican all my life.
It's just a conventional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish and my friends in New York call themselves Italian.
Later, I focused on the complex construction of "Mexican American".
But I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for nouns or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than a native speaker's, and I can't shake the American accent.
So I got my American passport and stood in line for the Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda was the usual meeting of presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto has been eager to talk about the upswing in the Mexican economy, which will now allow Mexicans to stay in Mexico with equal success, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to make a partnership deal with the U.S. and Canada and create a sort of North American trade bloc like the European Union.
President Peña Nieto has also promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals have been made.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is a difficult and old-fashioned matter.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and, under the gunpowder of its leaders, forced them to give up half their territory.
But Mexicans think in centuries, not minutes, and they see reminders of those events in everything.
So the moment any US statesman speaks a word of criticism of Mexico, the press and the elite of Mexican society immediately complain that the Americans are encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma are full of war.
The most difficult is Mexico's relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about resentment?
There's enough of them.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities in this country, and those who don't.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, there are so many people of Mexican descent for one reason only: at some point in their family history, someone -- father or grandfather -- was unable to fulfill themselves in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often, they were a certain type of Mexican -- dark-skinned, poorly educated, poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Our lives today are the American dream, we went to good schools and got good jobs, but we must remember that even that dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national identity is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider our own.
The United States of America.
We also know that most of the Mexican elite and ruling class don't like us.
We're going to answer them the same.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class citizens, as fake Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our ties to Mexico aren't strong enough.
Our very existence is explained to them by failure.
If our ancestors had made it in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind the silk curtain, finding a life in the United States, but losing our spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, and that reminds me that there are certain tensions between real Mexicans and Mexican Americans -- Mexicans are more aware of their national identity, and Mexican Americans are offended by it.
She's a U.S. citizen and she thinks she belongs in both countries.
At the same time, many of the Mexican Americans I know don't feel like they belong to either of them.
We listen to a Mexican band called Los Tigres del Norte, but we also like Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
And in the U.S., we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship is not already complicated enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to rebuild relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to act as ambassadors for Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a wonderful country it is and how great it is to visit, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
It's not gonna work.
Too much resentment in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, the rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us don't think this country is that great.
I'm sorry, but you guys can handle this on your own, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still can't forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still resent what was done to their relatives in Mexico recently.
I know.
I guess we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for future peace
Is there a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
The usual, pointless arguments about who started it all; the ruins of many buildings; the killing of more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis; the first time in the conflict that rockets fired from Gaza have hit the outskirts of Israel's capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even as Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly caught up in their eternal conflict, the Middle East is changing.
This can be viewed in different ways, but the events of the Arab Spring have turned many established realities into a rebellious storm, and Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to stay out of the whirlwind that has rocked the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will be even more bloody than before.
However, there is reason for hope in the path of salvation.
A War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation is not one of optimism.
Even if the ceasefire signed on November 21 is implemented, this week's clashes have only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in Gaza in 2007, will claim that they forced Israel to retreat despite the losses they suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the group's leaders have been killed and 1.7 million people are trapped in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
Hamas is actually building its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is on their side.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new influential and wealthy friends.
The resurgent regional leader Turkey, once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, has come out in support of Hamas; followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Persian Gulf states.
Hamas's triumphant supporters claim to have created an Islamist crescent around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah group rules, to Syria, where increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to topple Bashar Assad's government, and on to Jordan, where the king's rule is threatened by Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on Israel's southern borders, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement has strengthened under President Mohamed Morsi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was ousted in 2011, was a secular dictator who paid little attention to Hamas's support.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, is an organization much like Hamas, and its leaders are more populist.
In future diplomatic settings, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice even Israel and America cannot silence.
Meanwhile, Israel's hardliners will come to the opposite conclusion.
Militarily, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli Iron Dome missile defense system has justified its cost and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas missiles launched.
The citizens of Israel can sleep soundly, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the US has remained steadfast; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the latest round of violence.
Another important factor is Israel's economic prosperity, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although some 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza since 2004, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part by building a wall that reaches into the West Bank - a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu's position, whose Likud party - in preparation for the January 22 elections - has teamed up with even more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is quite convenient.
What's the point of giving the Palestinians their own state?
If you give them all the power in the West Bank, won't they start firing rockets at Israel from there, like their brothers in Gaza?
It's better to keep them against the wall and to suppress any attempt to raise their heads.
The hardliners may win, but their calculations may be disproved by the Arab Spring.
While the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere may not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be domestic issues.
Israel's defense budget is larger than all of its Arab neighbors put together.
Unleashing a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egyptian President Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and could signal the beginning of change.
Israel, no less, must consider the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic change comes to the Arab world, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus that blew up in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - is only exacerbating these problems.
The bloody operations that are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement are paying off with growing international discontent.
Both sides need an outside push.
The only solution that remains is one that is being relentlessly called for by sane people on both sides, and by much of the rest of the world and our paper: the creation of two states and the ceding of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
There is hope, not too great in the short term, that a ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the parties more effectively.
Egypt, which has long since decided to cut off arms supplies to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, are in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, agreed since 1967 with the exchange of territories and the shared use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than the upcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of a virtual state of Palestine.
President Obama has a role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own plan for a peace settlement.
After returning to the White House, he still shows little interest in getting involved.
It's a disastrously shortsighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible if there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, a law on uniform packaging for cigarettes has come into force.
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and images of diseased body parts are contrasted on the gloomy green boxes, which are the same for all brands of cigarettes.
Australia's first-ever law on the uniform packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products has been passed, replacing the logos and colour schemes of different brands with the same gloomy olive box with gruesome images of sick body parts and children whose health is being undermined by their parents' smoking.
Aside from the different pictures and signs warning of the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packages, which will be mandatory this Saturday, is the brand names, which are printed in the same small print.
These are the world's strictest conditions for tobacco packaging.
The federal government says the measure is designed to discourage youth from smoking by stripping the harmful habit of its fashionable status.
The basis for this decision was the results of studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26 never became smokers in 99 out of 100 cases.
"It is clear that even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through the packaging", explains Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that show that, for example, the crown in a logo is associated with the idea of a princess.
Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world, so the changes will not affect the profits of multinational corporations, but other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry strongly opposed the law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market, where cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This bill will have a serious impact that is different from what its proponents envisioned", says Scott McIntyre, a British American Tobacco representative in Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will be putting more of these products on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the other hand, new laws are a business opportunity.
Sandra Ha of the small family-owned company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that demand for cigarette packs and silicone cases that hide nasty images on the packaging has risen sharply (from virtually zero) since two months ago when companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a case in Australia's high court, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about 6,000 products to wholesale businesses and is expecting a new batch.
It's a good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the population to which these measures are aimed.
After a series of laws passed in Australia that made television advertising for cigarettes and their promotion of sporting events illegal, and prohibited vendors from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from posting ads online, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you're a tobacco seller and you've only got this one little loophole, the idea of advertising your product online may seem very tempting", explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes a rise in the number of reviews of trademarks written by supposedly ordinary users on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is this really the work of a common citizen who loves Marlboro so much that he spared no time and effort to make the video, or is it the work of an advertising company?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more concerned with adapting to the new regulations than with advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken steps such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these countries are filing complaints at the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that all of these countries have very little trade with Australia.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanie Plibersek, the government has been discussing with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to mandate the posting of tobacco warning photos.
Now this rule is adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstrating a lack of compliance.
I'm not affected by these pictures.
I'm just not paying attention.
"You just take out a cigarette and put a pack in your pocket", explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of King of the Pack tobacco store in Sydney's inner city, claims that the same packaging has made it difficult to arrange the products on the shelves
"It used to take me an hour to unload a new batch, but now it takes me four hours", he complains.
"If the government had taken over and banned cigarettes altogether, we would have said, 'What do we do, it's over, we close the store,'" he says, his hands up.
In a world of electronic networks and constant connections, it's not so bad to get bored.
On that Thanksgiving, I was suddenly stuck at the airport for five hours because our plane had a mechanical malfunction and had to be replaced with the plane we were waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and there's not much help in books, magazines, iPhones, or even duty-free shops.
Recently, however, a growing number of scientists and child-development experts have spoken in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations, it's not so bad for us and our children to be bored.
It forces the brain to focus on interesting, related topics, which may actually promote creativity.
And in our modern world, where we're all constantly in front of a screen, the benefits of boredom are getting away from us.
Maybe we should strive for boredom?
I'm not sure.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, like many people, that boredom was a relatively recent invention, when people had more free time.
That is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom has a very old history", he says.
On the walls of Pompeii, Latin inscriptions on boredom date back to the first century.
But the question remains, how do we understand boredom?
The problem, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, is that the perception and perception of boredom has often changed.
After reviewing research on the subject and asking a group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: Boredom is when people "want to do something but are unable to do something that would give them satisfaction".
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person does not do something he would like to do.
I don't want to do anything with apathy.
The main cause of boredom, he says, is "attention loss and the associated mood swings and the feeling that time is passing by slowly".
Boredom can sound very similar to depression.
However, despite the possible link between these conditions, Professor Eastwood argues, homesick people see the causes of problems in the world and in circumstances, whereas depressed people see the problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when in fact we just have trouble concentrating.
In their study, "The Unemployed Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a voice recording a journal reading.
Some participants also heard loud, unrelated sounds from a television program in the next room, others heard the same sounds at such a low volume that they could hardly be distinguished, and a third group listened to only voice recordings without a separate sound track.
Those who listened to the TV at a low volume reported feeling bored, more often than others - having trouble concentrating, but not knowing why, and attributing it to boredom.
When we try to concentrate on a difficult or exciting task, distraction can be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "like looking at a stream of products on a conveyor belt in search of a marriage, distracting music can help us avoid boredom".
He goes on to say that it is thought that when people start rocking in a chair or drawing on a piece of paper, they are doing so out of boredom, but we now know that in fact, such actions simply help to keep them physically relaxed.
"Research has shown that children who are not restricted from walking and spinning learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit still", claims Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at times - when our flight is delayed (as in my case), when we listen to a monotonous speech, when we watch a dull movie.
However, people differ in their tendency to be bored.
In the 1980's, researchers developed a "boredom scale" to measure these individual traits.
The scale uses questions and statements such as "A lot of what I have to do is monotonous and monotonous" or "I have too much to do, so I don't have time for anything".
Using questionnaires like these, researchers have found that boys are more likely than girls to be bored, says Steven Wodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, "especially when there are a variety of external stimuli".
However, teenagers in general are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he paged nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of teenagers said they were bored at school and during homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what similar data on boredom would look like now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "the tendency to be bored peaks during adolescence", largely because children and teens are not given the full freedom to choose what to do.
So back to my original question: Is boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, research shows, it can lead people to engage in absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling, or substance abuse in an attempt to escape boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have pondered the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Wodanovich, who has devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"That's how our brain tells us to do something else; that's boredom", says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But that same brain doesn't always know what to do.
If you're bored and you put that energy into playing guitar or cooking, you'll feel better.
However, if you start watching TV, you will only feel better for a while, and it will soon pass.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will stop being bored, but he will not learn to deal with boredom on his own or to manage his time and activities in any other way, says Professor Fenske.
"And these self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations", he says.
Your child is not only learning to do things on his own, but he is also learning self-control in general.
I don't think boredom should be glorified.
But it's not a bad thing either.
Rather, we should learn to be comfortable even outside the continuous flow of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
"We see it as a need to get bored more often, when boredom is a very unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful", he says.
What people really want is to get out of their constant worries and just relax.
"In today's world", he says, "we are used to constantly over-stimulating our senses, and when silence comes, we are lost and do not know what to do".
It's not clear how the new marijuana legalization law will be enforced in Colorado.
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old soccer player and community college student in southeastern Colorado, has been charged with a criminal offense that will soon be perfectly legal throughout the state: possession of a small amount of marijuana and the pipe he smoked it in.
Mr. Orosco says that one day in September, he and some friends were in Lamar driving through the prairie near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was subpoenaed for possession of narcotics and possession of a drug-use device - misdemeanors that each carry a $100 fine - and a court date was set.
"We are treated like criminals", says Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has persisted for weeks after Colorado voted to legalize recreational small-scale marijuana use, the decision of hundreds of small-scale court cases depends less on the law than on the venue.
Small marijuana charges are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which has taken similar action.
Police stations have already stopped charging people 21 and older for possession of small doses, which will only be considered legal once the law takes effect in a couple of weeks.
However, in more conservative districts of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to pursue existing marijuana cases and continue to prosecute for possession of the drug.
Meanwhile, some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous West are voting to ban new, state-licensed marijuana shops.
"It's all happening so fast, I don't even know what to expect", says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Washington state regulators are also scratching their heads in disbelief.
They will have to formulate rules to determine how to license the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most other states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so they're a good example", explains Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the D.C. Alcohol Regulatory Commission.
But now, Mr. Smith admits, there is nothing more anyone can do than to put forward proposals and hope that they will work.
"We don't have a real precedent to go by", he says.
The Washington state bill, called I-502, will go into effect on December 6 and leave the state in a state of uncertainty for a year, with no state licensing system yet and the right to possess marijuana already legal.
And there are still some technical issues that need to be addressed during this time, like how to balance the state's "adequate access" policy for licensed marijuana with a ban on selling within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It will be particularly difficult to locate licensed marijuana businesses in urban areas, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs", explains Ben Livingston, of the recently formed research group the Center for Marijuana Legalization.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates emailed his deputies that the city prosecutor's office would no longer prosecute individuals over the age of 21 for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that police would stop arresting people for these offenses "as of this moment".
Police Chief Oates said police would monitor the city's compliance with regulations governing the cultivation of medical marijuana and prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
The U.S. Attorney for Weld County in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, has taken a more aggressive approach to the matter.
After the bill was voted on, he said the prosecutor's office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession, mainly to encourage users to seek treatment.
At this point, 119 individuals are charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, although many are charged with other offenses.
"It is the duty of our institution to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission", Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer prosecute adults for possession of small amounts of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Hautsinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop charges in open marijuana possession cases.
"I believe that enforcing the law until it changes is our direct responsibility", he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the decision, incorporating recreational marijuana into the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the mixed reactions from residents in different parts of the state have exposed the ambiguity of the local authorities' response to the state's marijuana experiment.
"There is a cultural barrier to this issue for district attorneys", explains Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney representing marijuana convicts and a local representative for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have been persecuting people for this for so long that they can't really accept that it's not a crime anymore", he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, are set to become a nationwide testing ground for the idea of legalizing drugs.
Legalization advocates and state officials plan to expand the legalized trade, but at the same time they are anxiously awaiting directions from the federal government, which still plans to make the sale and cultivation of marijuana a federal crime.
Supporters of legalizing marijuana hope the Justice Department will back down on this issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of medical marijuana dealers and patients, the federal government has generally sanctioned the medical marijuana trade in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
While Bureau of Narcotics agents are unlikely to break into homes to seize a small bag of marijuana, they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are allowed under the new law, says Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug counselor in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado have been waiting for federal action.
Even before the presidential election, some local governments approved a moratorium on opening new marijuana stores, which would not be able to open for another year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, proposed a six-month ban on the marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a position where we're giving someone a license and then it's a big problem at the federal level", says city councilman Bob Nicholson.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a conflict between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved questions.
I was expelled from Oxford because I was a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their beliefs did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I've dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother both went to Oxford, and they described it as the best university in the world, a modern analogue of an ancient symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization -- freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying history at Worcester College, Oxford University, in the late '80s, I packed up and left, which resulted in the first real scandal of my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
The friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from the syrup cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was systematically poisoned and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I went to a private school.
I was poisoned for one reason only, and in this glorious cradle of the Enlightenment, it looked like a barbaric and blind bigotry: my father, now deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was a famous adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a conservative myself.
You may ask, why bring it up now?
According to recent reports, a new generation of students with center-right views are being bullied in the same way.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of conservative students demanded the same protection for their rights as those afforded to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at the Corpus Christi College student club in Cambridge say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and made to feel unwelcome" because of their political views.
They want to add an additional representative to the college's Equal Rights Committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was exacerbated by a recent BBC 2 documentary about student politics, Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right, which portrayed conservatives as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
The film featured Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, riding a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver top hat.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are being made "goats for the expense of higher tuition".
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Conservative Association at Nottingham University, said in an interview with the Sunday newspaper that "the university community is increasingly leaning to the left.
People who don't even know us assume that we are the brazen, unpunished children of rich parents".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at Corpus Christi College's history department, who was asked to step up his defence, called the atmosphere "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of Oxford University's Conservative Association, said the student club's attitude towards centre-righters had deteriorated significantly.
"This is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply to the normal life of the club members", she says.
For the first few weeks at Oxford, I wasn't just in the minority, I was alone.
I entered in September 1986, a shy, shy 18-year-old girl.
Oxford was racked with hatred of the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university voted to strip former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree because of budget cuts to higher education.
Even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable in such an atmosphere.
In the first few days of my freshman week, when the students were getting to know each other and the teachers, I had a first-hand sense of what was ahead of me.
I didn't know that teachers not only looked the other way on bullying conservative students, but they were also happy to participate.
Political issues - the miners' strike, privatization, and the government's refusal to sanction the apartheid government in South Africa - were pouring through the wooden-panelled walls of the auditoriums.
My first seminar was to translate an 18th-century French text into English, and I wasn't prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt", said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph".
I had trouble getting the lyrics, so I got stuck.
Harry Pitt was a very bitter man with a face like a cake.
"Do the Thatcherites not learn French at all, or are they just not smart enough?" he asked.
The other students giggled.
I was in tears.
"I suggest you take some initial French lessons in your spare time, unless you're too busy hanging out", Pitt snarled.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night at college, I was sitting alone at lunch; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student in the English department who introduced himself as a member of the university's Conservative Association.
"I know who you are", he said amicably.
- Unfortunately, the facts are as follows:
Anyone suspected of sympathizing with the conservatives will be mocked.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour".
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work.
A first-year student of philosophy, politics and economics, who had himself studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contagious".
The other students picked up on his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" one of them asked.
- They're kicking each other, aren't they?"
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the repeal of the law in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with my fellow believers only under the cover of night?
Am I going to be forced to become a Labour member and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years seemed like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only professor at my college who was open about his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for being Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He barely showed up at college.
He despised him for his provincialism, his pettyness, and his adherence to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he told me.
I started to travel to Oxford from my parents' home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased friends in the capital.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the forties, any political views were accepted.
"But it's the best university in the world", he said complainingly.
- They can't do that, except in the city of sleeping spires...
Even my Communist friends have always behaved impeccably".
His wet eyes were blurry.
"Do not make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You're gonna break my heart if you drop out".
I was exhausted from my constant trips to London and my emotional defenses were weak.
My friend, also a conservative, couldn't stand the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The next week at the seminar, when another history teacher called me "enemy of the people" in all seriousness, I decided to do the same.
In my heart of shame, I admitted that my parents had brainwashed me and called them "old fools".
The respite was short.
The final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was destined to be my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week for Rupert Murdoch's publications.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later, my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a weeping woman and a rag.
But no one should be subjected to this kind of anger and bullying at age 18 in a school setting.
And the sad thing is that it was Oxford that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but that still hides behind its ill-gotten reputation as a university that values equality and freedom.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
About the Valentino: Sewing Master exhibition that opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other high-profile clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, former residence of Queen Elizabeth I, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of Valentino: Master of Sewing, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his "house" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says in his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of a story whose only character is "il signor" Garavani, but it could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobility.
The first hall of the exhibition, open until March 3, is filled with personal letters and photos signed by the most distinguished aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a humble tailor from the northern Italian town of Voghera to the idol of the international "elite".
There's nothing wrong with being in love with the royal court.
"At least they don't put out their cigarette butts on your gorgeous carpet like some of the great pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a unique host who welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all really enjoyed coming to his shop in Gstaad", explains "Heine" Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli and Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza is reminiscent of the charismatic fashion designer.
We went to his house for dinner one night, after the fashion show in the Plaza de España in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy Jr.
Valentino's style was evident in everything -- every detail of his apartment, its decor, its food, its music.
"Valentino made each of his guests feel important and loved", recalls the top model, whose work with the designer began in 1995 during the Paris Fashion Week.
"He never goes out of style because his sketches are real works of art", she concludes.
The parade of the lineage
The life of Caravani is not a story of obsessions, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He likes people with good manners and high titles, and they like him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous, sixty-meter-long podium that offers a role-change: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the podium, gazing at the "spectators" from the dreams that shine with Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the suit that Monica Vitti used in The Night, or the wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farrah Diba.
The model audience includes names such as Sibylla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria, and Sophia Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the model, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine is like first love, "unforgettable".
I remember him well.
They were pants, a shirt, a vest and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
"It was a gift he gave me", says Nati Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to the rest because of his femininity, his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty", adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they're very bright and they're very good for his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion legislator Patricia della Giovanpaola d'Arenberg also cannot forget the first time she dressed as Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed I'd have the age and the reason to wear one of his evening towels...
Finally, that hour came in the late 1990's.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear to a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with a skirt, a corsage in the fold, and a cut without braces.
"It was a dream come true", says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is fashion-deprived, his passion is timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York, and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from the designer with "maximum care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories that accompany it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seams) to make this garment of ivory-colored silk with pearl inlays, twelve different types of rings, and a four-and-a-half-meter-long strip.
According to journalist Susie Menkes, the greatest authority on the specialized press, the dress represents a milestone in late 20th-century high fashion, "the return of customers from the high world".
Deceived for years by the "lifestyle" of the elite, Valentino is now its best representative.
Knight of the Grand Cross (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Knight of Labor, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garavani has received as many honors as any of his client's spouses.
"I was always attracted by his refinement, his calmness, his neat and flawless appearance", recalls d'Arenberg.
I last saw him a month ago at a dinner party at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribery, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, there is no time for him".
If the princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: the miners from Kawah-Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by hauling 70 kilograms of sulfur onto the volcano's steep rocky trails
Some people think their jobs are hell, and some people literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living mining sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano on the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Antônio descends to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gas rising from the Earth's depths freezes in contact with the air.
He chops off huge pieces of sulfur, which can weigh up to 170 pounds [70 kg], puts them in two bamboo baskets, wraps the baskets on his shoulders, and carries them up a steep rocky road.
It is only a quarter mile [250 m] to the top of the 8,930-foot-high [2,386 m] volcano, but exhausted truckers take more than 40 minutes to make a turtle-like ascent, struggling to keep their balance and carefully treading the path to avoid tripping and falling off a cliff.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the cliffs of Cavach-Ijene a few years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
Once at the top, they make their way through the tourists, who photograph them as if they were monkeys from a circus, and, weary of carrying heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the scales that the mining company has placed just above them, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
The company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, better still, its workers, is paid 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for every kilogram of sulfur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to petrochemical companies, since the mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"Because the norm is to carry 70 kilograms [70 lb], we earn about 46,000 rupees [US$3.8], or about $1.50 a day", explains Antô, who normally carries three items a day.
He spends three hours on each and is devastated at the end, but they allow him to save 138,000 rupees ($12) by the end of the day.
Although it seems a pittance for such an inhuman effort, it's three times what he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wage of the miners is very high by local standards, with a coffee harvest of 15,000 rupees ($1.40) a day and an average monthly wage of two million rupees ($1.60) ", explains a porter who used to work as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the site was not so difficult, but Antō returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a reason that is as devastating as sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where there are only Hindus, and brought her to Java to convert to Islam".
Antônio has asthma, he can hardly breathe, he coughs constantly, and he has tears in his eyes from the toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Antônio spent three years risking his life in Kawah-Ijen, where sulfur had already started to affect him despite wearing a mask and glasses.
He has asthma, he can hardly breathe, he coughs constantly, and he has tears in his eyes from the toxic gases that the volcano is releasing.
It's the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I'll work another two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French", he promises in more than acceptable English.
Sentenced to life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could have been a tour guide, a waiter or a hotel porter, but instead he is doing the work of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the darkness.
Defying the shadows, Antônio descends into the crater, illuminating his path with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carrying sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite its high profits, the mining company has not mechanised its sulfur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work at their own expense and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not even receive a portion of the 30,000 rupees ($1.50) photo fee, which, along with the 15,000 rupees ($1.2) entrance fee, the park's guards charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mule people.
"This is a job for cattle, not people", says Badrusin, a 42-year-old hard-working porter who has spent three decades in Kawah Ijen since leaving college.
He can lift up to 400 pounds [110 kg], and he says he will work "as long as he can" because he needs money to pay for the education of his three children, ages 18 to 10.
I'm not retiring. I'm dying here because the volcano is my life.
Although the sulfur burns their throats and burns their eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the dense plumes of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains of their severe illnesses... more serious, apparently, than their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, knee pain and shoulder ulcers that have deformed under the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can now lift only 50 kilograms at the age of 53.
Each day, he and his companions haul 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Taman Sari, covering a distance of 11 miles [18 km] along a narrow path through the bush.
"I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano is my whole life", says Unainik, opening his mouth wide, missing several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works as a sulfur transporter.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the world's toughest jobs: what human mules do from Kawah-Ijen.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and housing and education costs for not having children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I'm a patriot husband, you're my patriot wife, let's do our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of a mint bun commercial, but despite this - or perhaps because of it - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put bao in the oven" to mock the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes to use advertising to bring attention to this problem in an entertaining way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do "their national duty".
This thing is just for the Internet, so we needed to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in the country.
We're the worst in the world at reproducing our own kind, so we felt like this was the topic we needed to address.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things, like launching pheromone perfumes or having flash-dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing we can do to solve this problem, and that's write a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it so lightly is the Singaporean government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax breaks.
But all of this is inefficient.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Office, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 -- what's known as the replacement percentage -- was 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, director of the Office of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Administration, says that "improved education" and "a wider range of career opportunities" are the reasons.
"It has allowed people to have a wider range of choices when it comes to life goals and priorities beyond marriage and family", she explains.
These changes in social norms have led to a rise in singleness and a delay in marriage and childbearing, which has led to a decline in Singapore's birth rate.
Meanwhile, immigration policies that aim to dramatically increase immigration to counter population decline are causing outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore that have a hard-to-conceal xenophobia about many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping their salaries low and not wanting to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore's ruling party scored its worst result in an election since independence last year.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem, with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While falling birth rates have some impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare spending and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts to keep the number of small dwellings down.
For example, it's starting to affect the real estate sector.
The city development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These 46 square meter apartments are selling very well.
However, there is a view that they may promote a single-family lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of homebuilding firm EL Developers, says their "shoe boxes" sell much faster than the more spacious ones.
They're more popular in the sense that they sell out for days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our income is increasing.
However, he acknowledges that the new regulations provide clearer guidelines for developers who were previously barred from offering too many small apartments in the project.
Too much pressure .
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national fertility rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, housing is expensive, and education is expensive, so many people put it off", says a young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it's important to manage my own money and time", says another 20-year-old.
Both men and women cite their careers, stress, and housing and education costs as reasons for not having children.
So as much as the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, when it comes to having children, the final say is left to Singaporeans.
Personal offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is a private property or "the sphere of private life that they have the right to protect from any interference".
What is personal to a minor under 16?
How does he apply this definition to his daily life and social media?
Does he understand the dangers of discussing situations online that he would not share offline?
elPeriódico interviewed five teenagers, ages 10 to 15, who were frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very personal", in a personal plane, and "password and username", when applied to social media.
"I wouldn't post my biggest secrets", says ten-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the importance of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the world", he claims.
I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games to FB.
I also have fun with my friends.
"I would not share a photo that is not mine or someone who is acting stupid", he says.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to post indecent photos of naked people, to commit crimes, or to write abusive or angry comments.
Jorge claims to know 35 of his friends on FB and nine of his Twitter followers.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother knows, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're going to respond, I just upload them", he adds.
"Social networking is a distraction, and I can communicate with distant relatives or friends quickly", he says.
Without thinking, he replies that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't count on someone recommending it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter he admits that he doesn't know the 20 people added to his friend list.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, like music", he says.
The boy said that no one had ever asked him for his home address or phone number.
"If I am pressured or made to make demands, I simply delete them from my account", he admits.
Jose became a Ask follower after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is familiar with what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted.
"He never knew who it was", he assures us.
Victim said Jose didn't delete the account.
"Just turned on privacy".
It then explains the sequence of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of people he knew in awkward or confusing situations.
Yeah, I would if I didn't like a person or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cyberbullying", he says.
The key issues
Marylos Porras, an English teacher and education specialist, believes that to guide children and teens, it is important to understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet was born as a means to find information, but the advent of these sites has changed the rules of the game", she says.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prensky, a Yale University master of education and author of Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are them, children and youth, who were born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning", she says.
He explains that the subject is difficult "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what they can and cannot distribute, publish or talk about at an age when they are not mature enough to do so".
"Also, make them selective, while their most important thing is to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences", she adds.
According to one expert, the most effective way to teach children and teens about privacy is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it is useless", she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or would you like to see a picture of you published like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what other people are posting about you?
When you sign party photos, do you ask other people's permission to mark them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at all times?
Another point is to make them understand that they should behave online just as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Outside the Internet, you behave with respect, responsibility and other principles, and so should you on social media", she says.
Keep on the Watch
Eduardo Guardia, a university lecturer, elementary education professor and education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social media policies conscientiously.
By understanding each of these points, they have a good basis for discussing with their children the requirements for an online account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published", he says.
According to Gaudí, the key is to remind children not to talk to strangers.
UNASUR summit ends without the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the President of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically signed by the seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI UNASUR regular meeting of heads of state and government, but sources in the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the homepage that it would be released after closing, but then confirmed that at some point it would be published on the Peruvian government website.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the content was set out by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala during brief press statements.
Journalists' access to information about the Summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only a video of the presidential assembly without sound was broadcast in the press room with the message "closed session, sound is prohibited".
The little information that circulated among reporters was conveyed by the press secretaries of some UNASUR governments present at the meeting, but not the Peruvian one.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of the participating presidents, which caused outrage among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
The Peruvian presidential administration subsequently sent an email to the media with the summit's "final declaration", but it was a statement by Umala, not an official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Nations (SASA) and, despite press pressure, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not distributed.
The official website of the ASPA shows that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities tried to provide transmission systems for all journalists, but limited access to information as much as possible.
The summit also ended with Chile and Peru jointly deciding to accept the Hague court's verdict, which will settle a territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the ruling of the International Court of Justice, which begins hearing the case of both sides in The Hague on Monday, as part of the indictment that Lima brought against Santiago.
"We will respect and implement the decision that will clarify the differences that we are currently presenting to this international court", Umal said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, pacts and international tribunals", added Piniera, and greeted Umalu with a handshake against the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will comply with the International Court of Justice came just after Colombia protested this week against the Bogota Pact, under which it recognized its compliance with the court's rulings after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be flawed.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR was suspended in 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The host president, Olyanta Umal, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, a little later in the afternoon, Lima time.
The Head of State read the final document, in which he said that 16 agreements were adopted and 31 projects were approved among South American countries, the amount of the proposed investments amounted to 17 billion dollars.
Among the agreements, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the residence agreements".
He said that action was being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and organized transnational crime, actions to increase the availability of medicines, affordable Internet access in all parts of South America, and the collective and effective management of natural disaster risks".
As Europe is in crisis, "the economic union [of Latin America] should not have a triumphal basis, but should serve to expand our production base and foresee a better future for our cities", Umal added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve connectivity in South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and forming new economic patterns", the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five are related to Peru, and are limited to a transverse axis in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two aimed at greater connectivity with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its re-admission to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, united and with good relations between neighbours was another theme emphasized at the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting the regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to hold respectful negotiations on the maritime dispute resulting from the verdict of the international court challenged by Bogotá.
"The day after tomorrow (Saturday), I may meet with President Daniel Ortega", Santos said.
"We will review all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua", he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also within the summit, the bloc's defense ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the issue of protecting the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe on integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that creating a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe".
Correa, who was attending the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, told Peruvian state television that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically one homeland".
He defended, in this context, the project of establishing South American citizenship, which is approved by the UNASUR member countries.
"We need to achieve free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already happening with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past", he warned.
The Ecuadorian president has also shown himself to be a supporter of the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San Jose Pact on Human Rights.
The people who give the lectures never make any commitments, but we South Americans, on the other hand, sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States", he said, alluding to Ecuador's political asylum for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles but respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He added that at the time, "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be followed".
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary for demanding to come to his territory for questioning regarding an alleged sex crime, while "only Swedish law considers it possible to carry out it via videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorean embassy in London".
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of Assange's physical and mental health deteriorating.
"I have not spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious", the Ecuadorian president said.
What is real is the danger of his physical and mental health being impaired by being confined to a small space without the opportunity to exercise in the open air.
"It affects the health of every person", he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum issue granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a guarantee of immunity that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stressed that there were talks in London to find a solution to the WikiLeaks founder's imprisonment.
We don't negotiate human rights, which is not a word we use here, but there was a constant discussion.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a series of trials in different European courts", he said.
And he said, "If the UK gives us a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it's over".
And if Sweden, as it is perfectly allowed by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to present himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that he does not tolerate "mediocrity, dishonesty and lies that distort freedom of expression".
"The main enemies of press freedom are not corrupt politicians but bad journalists who support profiteering, blackmail and extortion", he said.
In this regard, he was satisfied that neither these journalists, "nor bankers, nor bourgeois countries-hegemons dominate Ecuador", and added that, being re-elected, he would "deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the guise of legality", because in reality "it has destroyed the legality of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "absolutely justified" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which was in favor of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At this time, this decision is not being followed.
This is a problem between South and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We have to work through them together to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good outcome in the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile, which is being heard in the same court, and said that "it is right for Latin America to go to international courts if the two countries commit to a decision, no matter how difficult it may be".
As for the possibility of running for a third consecutive term in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, he said he views the possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult".
Correa has said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador, socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to accept that responsibility", he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"It's a decision", he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new treatment course for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he was going for treatment, which was already scheduled, routine, and that he was expected to skip the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean that President Chavez's health is deteriorating", he explained.
The head of state of Ecuador took part today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when he was told that his test for AIDS had come back positive.
"I felt deaf", he recalls, "despite the doctor's tact, I was very upset.
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to cope with his illness on his own, he wanted to learn as much as possible about it, and his efforts paid off - he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" HIV patients at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he arrived in 1994 after overcoming many obstacles.
He's been living with HIV for 22 years, which was hard to believe in the early 1990s, when there were so few treatment options, so little knowledge of the disease, so much bias.
Even the director of the clinic at the Mexican Institute of Social Welfare refused to say goodbye to him "because he had a cut".
In other words, in those days, having AIDS was a sentence.
Now it's possible to survive with this syndrome and do so without compromising quality of life.
Yet, many people still come to the hospital unaware of their illness when the virus has already damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the world's first AIDS cases were reported, "the big breakthrough so far is that the survival of the patient who starts treatment on time is exactly the same as the survival of the general population", said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HCG HIV Unit, citing a report in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal.
Andrade Villanueva, an infectious disease expert and HIV/AIDS expert, explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a verdict, but that the length and quality of life depend on the extent of damage to the immune system that patients have at the time of diagnosis, with the best life expectancy for non-drug users being up to 30 years with 200 CD4s and up to 50 years with 500 CD4s.
Simply put, this means that a person diagnosed as HIV-positive at age 25 "can live safely to 75 years of age if he is kept under control", he explained.
To gauge this progress, it is worth remembering that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although deaths have declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), and it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have been reported as of May this year; however, it is claimed that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatalities?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how things are at our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years, we have not had a shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know they're infected, which is late in the disease.
He cited the devastating data: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some sort of opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore to provide mass detection samples to all people who ask for it".
The proposal is echoed by experts and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA) as well as patients like Fabrizio, who went to a private lab for testing simply because a friend had done it and despite his young age, he was already in the AIDS stage and even had Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer tumor that is a common complication.
It's different when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know.
"I'd rather die than get drunk three times a week", they say.
I'm making some positive changes, eating right, exercising, taking my medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have many classes, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and the other person", said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to promote his statement to those who are now in fear in the context of World AIDS Day.
Let them be tested for the risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, with responsibility.
This is his message summarizing the theme of the fight against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms are on the counter .
There are huge gaps between health programs and the average citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist in Guadalajara who has covered HIV.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "the condoms have actually increased in distribution, we used to be given one or two, now we are given a hundred packs, which is very good, but it turns out there are people who still don't have access to condoms", he said.
Teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you need them?" is a popular question, with scorn and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy workers and health workers, which teenagers do not want to hear, the propagandist said.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; to have condoms not just on the shelves, but in the vending machines in public toilets in places where young people frequent.
It's not encouraging debauchery.
It's not about paying for beer and a motel, Governor Emilio Gonzalez said when asked if condoms are available under his administration.
"It's not sexuality, it's making condoms available to people who are already sexually active", he said.
Key facts about Jalisco
A total of 13,435 cases were recorded (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th nationally in new and total AIDS cases and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections are through the genital tract, 6% through the bloodstream and 2% through the perinatal tract.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV, as there are four to five people who do not know it for every one recorded case.
Given the United States Court of Appeals' ratification of a decision that nullifies the debt restructuring of Vitro Group achieved through a competitive process in Mexico, the scenario sets a fateful precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in a neighboring country that has insolvency problems.
It seems that the procedures for supporting the survival of firms that are allowed by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of stripes and stars, in violation of international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of a June 15 ruling by Judge Harlin Hale in the Northern District of Texas Bankruptcy Court leaves Mexican firms vulnerable to the possibility of their assets being seized across the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door for Mexico's leading glassmaker to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies.
As a prelude, while the judge in the case notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says the main proceedings concern a contested proceeding being heard in Mexico.
The first clause provides for the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, the UN Model Law for Unifying International Trade Law was created for this purpose, designating the American Law Institute as the arbitrator.
Second, the verdict states that without the inter-company vote, the debt of the Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, which was recognised as a critical mass of the tender procedure, would not have been reached by the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro wasn't the first case where this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that, minus the votes of the branches, Vitro's creditors who fought it in the United States courts, namely vulture funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
That's the number the appellate court is dropping.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, affected by the severe economic crisis that has hit the United States, hitting the country.
For now, the Gonzalez Sada family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote reaches its full bench, that is, five judges, given that only three voted.
If this fails, a petition for certiorari will be filed, which will require a review of the case by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae ("friend of the court") that described the process Vitro would follow under the Competition Act, signaling that it was releasing itself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to tie it to Section 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
The report also notes that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, which are rules established for cases of interstate insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
It's a two-pronged gamble: they hit the Vitro and they hit the country.
The balance sheet
Given the months-long delay in the filing of complaints by Mexicana de Aviación unions against the company's former owner, Gaston Ascarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Airline Pilots' Union has already discovered the bottleneck.
The court, headed by Carlos Diaz Chávez Morino, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority systematically refused to provide reports to the Republic's General Prosecutor's Office regarding the operation performed by the entrepreneur to withdraw 198 million pesos from the F/589 trust fund of IXE Bank, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The resources would be used to buy shares in the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the major shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're surrounding the Dragon Mart.
Gathered at a forum at Caribbean University over the weekend, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of civil society have endorsed the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of China's Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We're talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean for the products of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for employees of 150 companies.
Canacintra had previously managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to confront the monumental forces that had leveled part of the protected areas and posed serious threats against the industry.
ACTA is dead
Regarding the government's refusal to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA in English, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already been filed.
As you know, the action was taken despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of considering it as a violation of free speech on social media.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debt without affecting short-term, homebuilder Homex is putting 500 million pesos worth of stock certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical, with an interest payment proposal every 28 days.
Competival is coming to life.
The newly formed consortium, which is led by NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, the leading IT companies, has just launched a new product, Competival, aimed at the software cluster services market in Central and South America.
The investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hatin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The avid basketball traveler Hector "Hatin" Reyes has been involved in the sport for over 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many basketball memories as Hector "Hatin" Reyes.
And before a brain hemorrhage confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for over 60 years, as a minor league player, Major League Baseball player, commissioner and head of BSN with the Baylor Cowboys, and president of the Basketball Federation.
"I have held many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several simultaneously, like when I was BSN president, National Team CEO and Federation president in the 90s", Reyes recalls during a Primera Hora visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating when he says that.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia gathered during his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
He holds the greatest emotions for those who remember his journey through the Cowboys, from the mid-1950s as a player to 1982, when he was 15 years old as a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be a part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Minsey debuted on BSN.
From that moment on, "Kuko" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over", Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was on his way here from the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and he said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7".
"Do you want to?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended a sniper named Raymond Gauss, who was granted citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Mincy could bring the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would help him win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy World Championship with Gauss, but I was a long way off because by 1988 I was already the head of the federation.
By then, I was enjoying his achievements and Mincy's national team achievements.
I remember when we first beat the United States in the Olympic qualifiers in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth and it should have been bronze, if not for that Canadian referee who made us play the final game, Reyes said.
That 1990 World Cup team, is that the best team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, just like the one that won for Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and beat the U.S. team, which was pretty much like the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
The team included not only Minsi, Gauss, Ramón Rivas, Fico López and 'Piculina' (Ortiz), but also younger players (Javier) 'Tonjito' Colón and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quijote' Morales, who was unable to play in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team that may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us the gold medal and a lot of joy, was the team from the 1995 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like Canito Nieves, Pablo Alisea and young Rolando Hurruitner replacing players suspended for disorderly conduct at the Pan American Championships in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculin did.
And that's not counting his career in the different leagues he's played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's a very complicated question.
We had a very good youngster, including Julio Toro, Flora Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armando Torres.
I'm a young man, and I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the Federation?
The most glorious era of the national team was between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s BSN had up to 17 teams per season.
What else can you do?
There were things I wanted to implement, like regionalising smaller categories.
Like, for example, that Ponce boys play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Kids travel and play too much these days, and it's unnecessary.
At least I'm seeing the benefits of mandatory certification and training for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch YouTube music videos from my era, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been there for me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R"., in the television series Dallas, in which he portrayed a principled, evil, and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the 1980s television series Dallas became a symbol of greed, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died Friday night from complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., Dallas' production studio.
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he loved most", his family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day Fair.
Linda Gray, who played Hagman's wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, kind and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
"He was an original personality and lived a full life", Gray confirmed in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a liver transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained fame on television for his role as a decent type in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
He played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive genie girl, played by Barbara Eden, and begins living with her under the same roof.
He was also the lead character in two comedies that rarely aired, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the pinnacle of fame.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its entourage aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who shot J.R.?", designed to create a buzz around the emotional episode in which Hagman's character is nearly killed, sparked international discussion and millions of dollars being risked at bookmakers.
It also helped to attract a record-breaking audience at the time.
When the answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million television viewers watched it, making Dallas the second most watched entertainment program in history, after the final of "MASH" in 1983 with 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. stopped her and then threatened to charge her with prostitution if she didn't leave town, but others had reasons to attack him, too.
Hagman played Ewing as a voracious corrupt with a charismatic smile: a dishonest businessman and unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be put into treatment.
"I know what should be on J.R.'s tombstone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the good citizen J.R. Ewing".
It's the only deal he's ever lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, both on and off screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who was lucky enough to know and love him.
The ten-episode new season of Dallas premiered a few months ago on TNT with great success.
Five episodes of the second season have already been completed and a sixth is in production, the channel said.
Warner or TNT have yet to make any announcements about what will happen to the show after Hagman's departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York stage in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met and married the young Swedish artist Mai Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, home to many celebrities.
In 2001, he published his memoir, Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I did not include anything that I would consider capable of causing pain to anyone or affecting them in any way", he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an organ donor and volunteered at a hospital to help patients who were afraid.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery and after", he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "don't worry, it's gonna be a little awkward for a little while, but you'll be fine".
He was also an active anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
A course that explores the end of the world is about to begin.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Sharme decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had a strong lure: the end of the Mayan calendar's "long countdown" on December 21, which many people took as proof that the world was coming to an end.
But Sharma had no idea what lay ahead in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a financial crisis that some call "the long Armageddon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian end-times theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all", Sharme told students at Rutgers University-Camden, New Jersey, this week.
If you look at what's happening in the world right now, as if we only have 30 days left, it's been a really good period.
And remember, bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only professor who's teaching a course on the end of the world this semester, which is theoretically the last one in history.
At Temple University, adjunct professor Barry Wacker is teaching a course on media, culture and the end of the world.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're looking at why these ideas spread over time", he said, and the way they suggest hypothetical scenarios that cause certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war may break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and examined how they relate to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell students about what's possible, probably plausible and impossible", Walker said.
On the main campus of Penn State, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to teach a course called simply "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' so we can always read the course again in case the world doesn't end", Restall said.
Despite the "imminent destruction", students must study, prepare projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night the world supposedly ends", Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"The seats ran out in two hours", Restall said of his high-school course, which had 35 students enrolled.
We've been getting emails for weeks before the semester starts from people asking if there's still space.
Students, in turn, say that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch people do things to comfort themselves", said Bridget Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic mindset, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Wakesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he had watched all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a course that teaches this", he said.
I like him.
But not one student interviewed - let alone the professor - said he believed the world would end on December 21.
"Our first project involved a Mayan prophecy, and we kind of discredited it", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple University in West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back several centuries, where people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in this speculation.
"In other places, people don't think about it", he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching a course in the Philippines this year, was quick to respond when asked if he knew of any "end of the world" courses there.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world", he wrote, alluding to the higher court's order.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that there had been talk for a long time about many days of the Last Judgment, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are careless about this date.
Some said they were going to an "end of the world" party.
"Maybe I'll call some of my friends and laugh with them", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
