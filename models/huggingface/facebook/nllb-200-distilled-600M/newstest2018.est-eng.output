In Estonia and Spain, four members of the Kemerovo Group were detained
According to the Postman, the police in Spain detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating under Estonia, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested on the court's permission.
Yesterday, the court also took into custody three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo crime community, aged 27-57, who are mainly involved in drug offences.
In the province of MÃ¡laga, Spain, the alleged leader of a criminal organisation was detained in Mijas.
In Estonia, three men were detained as suspects, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal community and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected suggest that there were clearly allocated tasks and roles within the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal community's activities was to commit drug offences and thus earn criminal revenues", commented Prosecutor Vahur Verte, Head of Pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters.
"We do not rule out the possibility of an increase in the number of suspects in this criminal case", the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement before, and some of them have been convicted of drug offenses.
The Commission also considered that the Commission should be able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take appropriate measures to ensure that the measures are implemented in accordance with the objectives of the programme.
"International cooperation has become a regular activity for us and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation", commented Prosecutor Verte.
The head of the Central Criminal Police Department, Ago Leis, said the arrests were preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted nearly a year and a half.
"Long-term work was carried out in the first half of the week and we were simultaneously detaining suspects in criminal cases in Estonia and Spain", he said.
The police said that the Central Criminal Police were assisting in the detention in Spain.
For years, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the civil police.
These arrests are a further message to criminals that they will be caught on the other side of Europe", said Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that while in prison, the men suspected of being criminals can continue to commit new crimes, and the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his extradition to Estonia.
In the context of this criminal case, the confiscation of property, vehicles and cash has been seized.
The pre-trial procedure in a criminal case is conducted by the Central Criminal Police's Organised Crime Bureau and is led by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, after Nikolai Tarankov, the son of a high-ranking civil servant, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the criminal world.
Gulevich, from Kemerov, rose to prominence in Estonia in the early 1990s when he began to engage in foreign affairs in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes working at various hotels and charged businessmen a monthly roofing tax.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal proceeds and the judgments in force confirm the effectiveness of the fight against organised crime.
For example, the recent judgments, the so-called Dikaev criminal community criminal case, which separated eight defendants from the criminal community from which EUR 80 000 in criminal proceeds were confiscated, or the judgment against nine individuals for the creation in 2006 of a criminal community by Igor Aleynikov, which was directed at the illegal trade in secret cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to human trafficking in Eastern Virum and Southern Estonia.
The amount of confiscated criminal proceeds is almost 71,500 euros.
The success of these criminal cases has been demonstrated by the fact that police officers exchange information with external colleagues and prosecutors exchange evidence every day and, if necessary, cooperate in any country of the European Union.
The Civil Rights group warns against traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri about the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The NAACP Traveler's Note for the State of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, calls on all African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to be especially vigilant and extremely cautious when traveling throughout the state, given the racially suspicious events that have recently taken place and are being reported here".
The NAACP said the group was prompted to issue travel warnings by a recent Missouri law that makes it harder to win discrimination cases and by the fact that the state's law enforcement is largely targeted by minorities.
"The civil rights of the people are violated.
They are drawn to the teaser because of their skin color, beaten or killed", said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri chapter of the NAACP, to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had such a strong complaint before".
This is the first such warning the organization has issued for a U.S. state.
The gang referred to events such as the racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders of Tennessee.
Sanders died in the middle of this year under suspicious circumstances after running out of gas while driving across the state and was taken into custody by Missouri State Police without charge of a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General that shows that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped in the state than white drivers.
"The mark is meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends, and coworkers about what could happen in Missouri", Chapel said.
"People must be prepared, whether it means taking the bail or informing relatives they're going through the state".
Based on the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state 16th nationally in terms of the number of similar crimes.
The travel advisory is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for a company to file a lawsuit for housing or job discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws requiring local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
The State Department usually issues travel warnings for other countries, but recently interest groups have started using this measure as a counteraction to certain domestic laws and trends in the United States.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or hepatitis, can be caused by five different hepatitis viruses - hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.
All these viruses cause severe inflammation of the liver.
However, at a paramount cost, there is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can develop into cirrhosis of the liver, or cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
According to WHO epidemiologist Kuulo Kutsar, the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver disease - fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, gray rash, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last diagnosis is also the origin of the common name of the liver disease, the yellow fever.
Children may have hepatitis without symptoms.
The different types of PAH can only be identified on the basis of laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can develop into chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without symptoms, meaning that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Listening Call brings out the different forms of hepatitis and describes their pathways.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick to sick humans and infect us by eating or drinking contaminated food or water, by having sex, by excretion from infected humans to their hands and hands, to food items, surfaces, objects, by entering their mouths, and by using drugs.
The risk group for hepatitis A includes family members and carers of patients with hepatitis A, people with chronic liver disease, people who have sex with infected people, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Vaccination can be prevented by vaccination, in particular vaccination is recommended for people travelling frequently and at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before eating.
Hepatitis B viruses are transmitted through exposure to the blood of a patient, drug injection, tattooing, digging, use of blood-contaminated objects (skin bags, hair removal products), donation of blood, sex with a person with hepatitis, and from a patient with hepatitis to the mother's fetus/newborn.
Injecting drug users, sexual partners of infected persons, men who have sex with men, newborns of infected mothers, sick family members and carers, healthcare workers, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis B infection are at risk for hepatitis B infection.
In particular, it is recommended that people at risk be vaccinated, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, STDs and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B are: refraining from the use of foreign hygiene and manicures, other sharp instruments and syringe needles, tattooing and digging, and using condoms in contagious sex or avoiding sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation programme in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are transmitted through contact with the blood of a patient, drug injection, tattooing, digging, use of blood-contaminated creatures, donation of blood, sex with a person with hepatitis and transmission from a hepatitis patient to the mother to the fetus/ newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injection drug users, sexual partners of infected persons, men who have sex with men, newborns of infected mothers, sick family members and carers, healthcare workers, rescue workers and police officers who come into contact with blood and other bodily fluids, persons with HIV infection, and travellers visiting countries with high incidence of hepatitis C.
The measures for preventing hepatitis C are: avoidance of the use of foreign hygiene and manicures, other sharp tools and syringe needles, tattooing and digging, and use of condoms in contagious sex.
There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection is co-occurring with hepatitis B or superinfection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
D hepatitis viruses are spread through contact with blood and other bodily fluids, infected needle-needles, through the genital tract and rarely from infected mother to fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and non-immune people with hepatitis B.
Effective prevention is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from hepatitis D virus infection.
Hepatitis viruses are transmitted fecal-oral via drinking water and food, including the consumption of low-heat processed meat, fish and seafood, donor blood, co-administration syringes and infected mother fetuses.
Travellers may become infected with hepatitis E in countries with high incidence.
The preventive measures for hepatitis E include the following hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after taking care of the patient.
Wash your fruits and vegetables before eating, avoid eating little processed meat, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water, and avoid using drugs.
Although competitors tried to push the four-time Olympian off the line in the final lap, Farah, 34, found strength in the final lap and won with a time of 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, taking her husband Tania and children to the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
It was wonderful to be on the track with them", Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for her fifth consecutive title in London, the 5000m and 10,000m gold doubles.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "A Lady in Gold: The Extraordinary Story of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's Portrait" delves far deeper into the cultural life of Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
But more deeply, history.
The sculpture would have been more impressive if it had been used up, or if it had been a more rigid plot, a narrower subject would have been used up to make more impact on the extraordinary portrait story that the title allowed.
Now, it would seem that there would be two books in the middle of the book: the story of Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer, in her painting "The Lady in Gold", and a much larger and more comprehensive history of the respected Jewish family and the German occupation and its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book takes us through the cultural life of Vienna, a city that was in the middle of the boom and bust, and whoever found himself in Austria's capital, can at least imagine how life was going around the RingstraÃe more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone in the Central CafÃ© turned their heads when Klimt entered.
The concentration of cultural activists was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and seeing a familiar name in a book makes you feel like a gram of culture.
But the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city with incurable syphilis and the highest suicide rate in Europe seems to add nothing to the story.
Or perhaps, even so, every single single brushstroke adds color to the cultural life of early 20th century Vienna.
The dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the Jewish population in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, about one in ten inhabitants of Vienna were Jews.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married the two-time Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and posed for Klimti's famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet was not attracted to the glamorous life she belonged to.
When you look at "The Lady in Gold", it's hard to believe that the end of life was infected by this great lady of socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband's portrait from Klimt, he was the hottest artist in Vienna at the last minute.
The climb was ordered at the time at 4,000 crowns, a quarter of the price of a well-located mansion.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of being a model of a master's love story did not deter the sugar magnate.
As for Adele, the only certainty is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that developed during her work continued for the rest of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Lady in the gold.
The masterpiece of Gustav Klimt, the extraordinary story of the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before the work began with Adele, Klimt had visited the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and researchers believe that the splendid mosaics of Empress Theodora there gave the artist the idea to paint a golden portrait of Adele as a mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Daam in Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and about the same time (1907-1908) another golden country, "Kisslus", was born.
Art historians have not missed the similarity between the two women.
What's the connection to Hitler?
"I think I owe my friend Klimt a debt of gratitude to make his work available to the public", Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere Museum a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) and wished their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before he died, Klimt had done another portrait of Adele.
In her will (Adele left in February 1925) she also asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four landscapes of Gustav Klimt to the Austrian Gallery.
He left his wives to his nieces Maria and Louise.
A year after graduating from the Mona Lisa in Austria, Klimt tried to get into the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, but failed in the drawing competition.
Although Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes attributed to the fact that Jewish professors did not accept him into the academy, none of his undergraduate students were actually Jews.
However, by 1939, the Austrian Gallery, mentioned in Maria's will, had undergone a dramatic change - the importance of finding works that would appeal to the Nazi Party in Vienna's rich Jewish art collection.
Hitler's personal artistic endeavour included some of Adele's work at home, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the Nazi art heist, a decade-long legal battle between the Austrian government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauer family began.
Just to be clear, if you see Kiss at Belvedere Castle in Vienna, Adele Bloch-Bauer's Lady in Gold should be seen driving to New York's New Gallery.
And before we go to Vienna, read the book I mentioned.
Even if you don't plan on going to see Klimt's work, because at least my emotions have been more about the Nazi and Jewish theme since the book closed than the $135 million painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait, but rather a family tale -- and a very moving story.
The Bauer family tree mentioned at the beginning of the book made it remarkably easy to navigate the events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was close to Estonia's record in Canada.
In the preliminary round, Gold was very close to his personal best of 200m breaststroke swimming at 2.16.62.
The tip mark dates back to a 17-year-old who reached 2.16.58 at the Canadian Junior Championships a week ago, according to the Priet Desert Swimming Blog.
Gold was the last one to make it to the A-finals, maybe the tenth.
In the final, she crossed the distance in a time of 2.15.76 and finished seventh in a new high.
Alina Kendzior's Estonian record (2.15,13) was broken by Gold by just over half a second.
Gold rose to third in Estonia's all-time ranking and his fresh personal best is Estonia's fifth all-time record.
A young prospect is still in the running for the Canadian Adult Championships in the 100m, 200m and 400m freestyle and 200m and 400m individual medley.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto, and Gold made a successful start there, too.
She won the 200m freestyle with a time of 2.03.22.
The last time an Estonian swam this distance was in 2008.
Only the Estonian record-breaking Elina Partoka has swum this distance faster than Gold.
The Estonian living in Canada won another bronze medal in the 100m freestyle with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season high of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than her, has swam this distance only a century faster.
He reached his personal best in the 100m hurdles in the opening round of the preliminary heats with a time of 1.03.69.
In the half-distance, he finished seventh in the final with a time of 2:17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season standings at four different distances.
President Trump is on vacation, critics are grinding their teeth
The holiday season is here, which means a break for President Donald Trump.
But since Trump has been one of the most vacationed presidents to date, critics are already grinning.
USA Today and CNN reported that the president plans to spend a 17-day vacation at his own golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the presidential vacation started yesterday, anti-Trump protesters have been speaking out on the holiday for weeks.
They're throwing Trump a little too much rest.
The president, by the way, has a habit of spending the weekend in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
By the way, Trump hasn't been the most talked about president in his 196 days in office.
For example, George W. Bush had been on vacation for 67 days, and Barack Obama was half as short as Trump, only 21 days.
But Trump tends to forget things quickly.
Countless days after becoming president, Trump said on "60 Minutes" that there was no time for long vacations during his term because there was so much to do.
He also made a public statement three years ago about the resentment of Barack Obama's vacation.
The current president tweeted: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is beating the press with their heads".
White House officials say a 17-day visit to the golf club is not a relaxing experience.
It's officially called a vacation, where Trump doesn't have time to read or do any other mental activity.
There must be another reason for taking time off work.
Namely, the air conditioning system is being replaced at the White House's West Wing, and all staff had to leave.
The Oval Office and other presidential offices are also located on the West Wing.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the west wing in August when it's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioning", said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president will continue to work during the holiday season.
From where President Trump is spending the next 17 days, you get a sense of the video.
Blocking Facebook critics - Don't run for public office if you can't stand voter criticism
Our father knew so much about the harmless media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the papers to start blaming him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Of course, the criticism irritated him.
But he didn't silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech may be taken away from us and in darkness and silence may be led to the slaughter like sheep".
That brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan's people have blocked and deleted at least 450 posts from people who shared their views on his official Facebook page.
And earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a complaint against him.
The governor's office has dismissed the lawsuit, and the online comments have been rife with "Who cares?"
"It's just Facebook", many said.
But it does.
And that counts a lot, especially with a man like Hogan.
This is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a super-democratic state.
His approval rating ranks second among the state's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a thoughtless, reactive sniffer.
He's led the state with a firm hand and he's held to his principles.
In addition, she has used Facebook as a primary means of communicating with her constituents rather modestly, for example, by showing her hairy head for the first time after a chemotherapy procedure.
So the Governor's Page - which is an official public forum run by taxpayer dollars-paid staff - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block visitors.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hoogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chase defended the governor's behavior, saying that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of Internet trolls, junk mailers, or hateful people on the web.
The Post was talking to several real people that Hogan had blocked.
And that's what they are -- real people who interact with their chosen leaders -- teachers, business owners, and pastors, not Internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan's Catholicism.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Maryland, was not inciting anger, but actual hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news", she wrote in a commentary for The Post.
"I also dislike the idea that when so many people comment on the same subject, someone immediately calls it a reckless collective effort, rather than admitting that it is a huge concern of citizens".
What the governor's office called a "targeted garbage raid" would likely be called "open support".
The Facebook age makes it easy to match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than it used to be when workers had to be sent out to do the same thing, to collect critical editorial papers and burn them or arrest protesters and silence them.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for tampering with Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has filed a lawsuit against Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark court decisions on this topic was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that a former Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by blocking a voter from his Facebook page.
Kentucky also visited the ACLU after the use of Facebook and Twitter by Governor Matt Bevin (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, D.C., the cost of mail was similar to the cost of the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, a fourfold increase in the number of newspapers and anonymous correspondents belittled his management style.
And even then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, making decisions in Washington.
According to historical documents collected as part of the George Washington Online Letters Collection Project, his cabinet was buried under petitions that criticized his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with the United Kingdom.
But he didn't make them shut up.
Freedom of speech, dissent and debate are the foundation of our country.
And right leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes the Renaissance Club will provide comfort for the home territory.
Former European representative Ronan Rafferty hopes to make the home territory comfortable over the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open is played at the golf courses of the East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The Northern Irishman, who last year led the last lap of the next-door Archerfield Links before Paul Ealees's demise, has become a fan of the new venue and will replace founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi as the tournament ambassador.
"I saw the Renaissance Club built, and now we see the club shine with this event in its full glory", said Rafferty.
"The players see the track in its best shape, it's in a glittering state.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He's a passionate golfer and he's proud of what he's accomplished here.
It gives you a great way to present yourself".
Englishman Eales is eager to defend his first title, even though he has won on both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It makes me feel very special", said a Southport-based player.
"I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open title because it was removed from my winning calendar a year later.
It's magical to come back in this box.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember from last year, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year's win was special.
It was a very special time that we will always carry in our hearts".
Homecoming Gary Orr, who joined the senior European tour earlier this year when he turned 50, is back in the race.
This is his first event in Scotland since his participation in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"Playing at home is always a little more meaningful", said Orr, a man from Helensburg.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel extra.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've shown a pretty good golf game.
I'm happy with the way things are going".
The trio will be joined by former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder captain Sam Torrance are two of six Scottish players on the pitch, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free and parking costs Â£5 per car for one passenger and Â£10 for two or more passengers.
All proceeds will go to the Prostate Cancer UK charity.
Poverty and Death on the Gold Coast of Indonesia
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a pencil.
He seldom even uses a pot.
In the wooden mansion in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai regency of the rugged province of Papua, Indonesia, a local princess places a potato, known locally as nota, directly on the fireplace.
After half an hour, the coated pot is taken from the fire and eagerly applied to the skin with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on a muddy floor - without furniture - and does his daily household chores, such as washing clothes with sewage from nearby plants.
The role of the worm is filled by a bucket in a roofless room.
Since she is the youngest of her husband's four wives, she is not assigned to care for any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
But working late can be dangerous - most of the men in the village are working and many of them drink heavily, and there are still soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around the village after five o'clock at night", he says.
This is a rare glimpse into the life of the former Dutch colony of Papua, which was annexed by Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum forced just 1,026 elderly people to vote with their hands up in the face of the occupying forces.
The movement, which encouraged Dutch liberation from the rule of the Dutch, quickly angered the Jakarta government, which still maintains its strong control over the region, keeping away foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, leaving the eastern part of the island to remain independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is a remote and abandoned place, reaching the province's capital, Jayapura, by 90 minutes' flight to Nabir, and then by rental car, a daunting five-hour journey.
There's no public transport.
With a population of about 19,000, the city is made up of wooden huts surrounded by bamboo slopes and wavy iron roofs, the rust of which has turned them into yellow browns of varying hues.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, not to mention journalists, and almost no foreigners have been here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the pope of Mee Pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes", says Degei, referring to his colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse, and bright silk.
"Before that, we only wore a vegetable.
Paapua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold-rich land.
Within 100 miles of Pania, a mountainous province about the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000, is the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about US$3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua boasts of a supply of timber worth an estimated $78 billion.
But these riches are a source of papal suffering, because they are the cause of the stifling presence of the powerful Indonesian military.
A 2005 study in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and troops about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 per officer.
The efforts of the popes to secure greater autonomy threaten this golden one and are being mercilessly treated.
Human rights activists say that since 1969, more than 500,000 popes have been killed and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings in the mountainous lands of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s were the magnitude of the genocide.
Last year alone, police in Indonesia arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
The 2016 report of the Archdiocese of Birsbane, "We'll Lose It All", contains testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (a second report says that rape and electrocution are particularly common), and violent indignities in peaceful protests.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because such incidents occur every week", says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The crustaceans are even more tightly confined because Papua's natural resources have caused the influx of newcomers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83 percent of the province's 3.5 million people are Christians, but the demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's population centers on the islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Javanese family dishes sell gado-gado with a mixture of onions and garlic, which are served with a layer of peanuts.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables at a lower price than local popes in the traditional market", explains Abeth You, 24, who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura for work.
"The popes of the population - the popes' mothers [women] - are losing their market share as a result".
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, known to the public as Jokowi, pledged to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter won his way to the presidential palace of Jakarta from 29 of the 27 constituencies of Papua, including Paniai.
But little has changed in the Papacy, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the hope that he will live up to our hopes for justice", You says.
In fact, Paniai struggled with low self-esteem only two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarot were singing a Christmas song in a cave in the mountains of Enarot, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on a motorcycle.
The kids who were there told them to turn on the screens.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their vote and later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and eyewitnesses said soldiers chased children while drunk and beat them with their handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot the children's carpet.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election commission building was set on fire, and things got even more unstable the next day.
About 1,000 young men, women, and children from Papua gathered for justice on the football field in front of the local police station and military command center.
They wore ceremonial hunting buses and performed the Waita-Pago dance of the Papua honey tribe, which included running around and singing birds.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and soldiers.
In a rage, the soldiers were ordered to go on a domestic radio. "If the crowd is more than three times as resistant, shoot them", said an official document seen by TIME magazine but not released to local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, an elder in Kego Koto, Enarot, sensed the threat and urged peace by urging the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"I was shot in the left arm when I turned around", he told TIME magazine on his brightly colored wooden porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he says the bullet came from the lines of the soldiers gathered.
"The crowd was many, the temptation was many", he adds.
Local Alfius Youw saw him shoot, and his cousin said he was shot three times.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", said John, who uses only one name as many Indonesians call it, in a dark tone to TIME magazine.
"I saw that she was dead... and I kissed her".
Inspector General of the Papuan Police Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates were only ensuring the security of their own department because it was attacked.
"We must protect ourselves when threatened with death", said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, Papua Police's press officer, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the killings didn't reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the abuses in Papua.
"I want to resolve this case now so that it never happens again in the future", he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he was establishing an extrajudicial mechanism to address human rights violations.
But almost immediately, there was an apology.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes", he said.
However, speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto retracted his words, saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism in the Papal States to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said that "everything is settled according to the law".
Wiranto, who has been accused of human rights crimes by the UN in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said 11 human rights crimes had already been solved in Papua, including in Pania.
The families of the victims of Paniai responded to such claims with a dark grudge.
"I have been interviewed four times in the past three years, but no progress has been made", said Johannes.
"I'm tired of it".
He says he's still scared years later.
"I'm scared", he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot".
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Pania were afraid to dismiss this incident.
He said he got beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
"After the burial of the bodies, the army came looking for me", he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighboring Paniai regency of Deiyais.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when a conversation broke out between the villagers and the construction company manager who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby river while fishing, died on the way to the hospital.
Hated villagers protested on the construction site outside the company's office.
Police said villagers were throwing stones at police officers, who responded with warning bullets.
But according to local reports, a mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) began shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We are in a great panic, afraid of revenge", said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured being attacked.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days.
The parliament of Deiyai has demanded that the police officers involved in the case be held accountable and that the police mobile brigade be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development fuels the discontent of the honey, moni, dan, and dama tribes of the Papuan peninsula.
Many of them have joined the Free Populist Movement (FPP), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of popes by staging random attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, the military has in recent years arrested thousands of people in Pania, and has arbitrarily detained them in the wake of the "defence of state sovereignty" proclamation.
Some of them never come out again.
Among the people of Papua, Pania is known as "a tragic forgotten place".
Poverty is the source of discontent.
The small amount of rice sold in Enarotala is too expensive for the locals to buy.
The bread is just as inaccessible.
People grow all their own food -- mostly potatoes, plus a little fruit and vegetables.
Breeding is a woman's job, each of whom can take care of four or five strains of potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crop for the family, and sell the rest at the local market.
Ten potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between the native Popes and the new migrants who have arrived in large numbers since the opening of the new airlines at Nabire Airport has deepened.
These few jobs that exist are going to better educated and wealthier migrants.
The pope often lacks the capital or skills needed to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying here because there are no jobs or money", says John Gobai, chairman of the Panhai Tribal Council.
Separation keeps the world's eyes away from the Pope.
In addition, strict restrictions remain on the external media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from the Pope for "not observing appropriate practices", despite having been granted a rare film license.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division, Jokowi's election pledges to lift the restrictions on reporters to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"In Indonesia, journalists trying to report from the most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua are facing new threats - visa denial and blacklisting", he said in a statement.
The lack of a proper eye on the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's neighbors.
In March, the UN Human Rights Council urged six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Belu, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - to investigate "a wide range of crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Pania.
The following countries have historically supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's accusations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic order and press freedom, so evidence of human rights violations would be difficult to bury".
Local people want more attention from foreign governments.
When the Dutch official delegation, headed by the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, the local people who attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous broke their silence, urging: "We want freedom".
Indonesia is holding a new presidential election in 2019, but the popes do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are connected to the shooting of Pania", says Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to understand that in addition to the fact that the people of Pania are constantly threatened by a predatory army, they are also suffering from poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other popes, consider their vote to Yoko to be a debt to be paid.
"They don't need money, they want justice", he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims managed to cope with one last symbolic reaction - burying one victim's body on land opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be done, they do not at least let the guilty forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed", says Yacobus, with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
The Dubai Torch has been swallowed by a cloud breaker for the second time.
A fire broke out Friday in Dubai, one of the world's tallest residential towers, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
This is the second fire to have destroyed a high-rise in just two years, which is occasionally called Torch or Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no direct cause of fire was reported.
"We slept and woke to the fire alarm and the screaming of people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor", said a resident who called himself George.
According to Dubai Civil Defence officials, firefighters extinguished the fire at around 4am local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they're working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the surface of high-pressure surfaces worldwide.
In the wake of the 2015 Torch fire, the Torch management team found that the most damaged facades were the exterior decorative panels and insulation.
British police have said they believe the insulation and facade panels of the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that started there in June, killing about 80 people.
Look, these phones are probably gonna be big sellers in the fall.
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then phone makers will release their new flagship models.
Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were on sale in the spring, and new hit phones are expected to hit retailers in the fall.
According to Tele2 Marketing and Sales Director Kristjan Seema, the flagship is characterized by an innovative design, a vision scanner, a 4K display with a cross-serv screen and a high-speed processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8 has also made a big impact on the world of technology, reaching the top of the Estonian smartphone sales table.
In autumn, the new generation of electricity will have even more fast charging, more durable batteries, a better camera, and better water and dust resistance.
It added that the hearsay data already allows for assumptions and forecasts of the four top models likely to dominate sales data this year.
These four top-of-the-line smartphones will hit retailers this fall.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to hit stores in mid-September.
Rumors about what Apple's new model looks like and what it can do about it are spreading.
While the iPhone 7 did not show significant differences compared to the iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to be a complete departure from its predecessors.
There are four colors: black, white, pink, gold, and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen covering the entire front panel of the phone, missing the home button, and the fingerprint reader built into the screen.
Apple's head of design, Jonylive, is demanding that the new iPhone look like a glass.
There's also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the eye-catching scanner, wireless charging and even higher-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
It's definitely one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
The preview of the newest model, the Galaxy Note 8, will begin on August 23.
There's been a lot of talk about what the new Galaxy Note 8 is going to look like.
It is reported that even more is intended for the business user and that the S Pen enables even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wave-shaped lens and the other with a narrow field of view.
At this point, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
But we're waiting for August 23.
While Nokia has brought three smartphones to market this year, the flagship Nokia 6 is still missing, the Nokia 8, which will be launched on August 16.
We expect Nokia to have a 5.3-inch, edge-to-edge display and a super-brilliant Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
Nokia also has an aluminium body and a significant water and dust resistance of IP68.
Similar to Samsung, the new Nokia model has two rear cameras, with optics produced by Zeiss.
If Sony has been a solid flagship of XZ Premium up to now, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We're expecting a smartphone that's a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least with the same or better camera.
There's been speculation about the new Sony model, that it's at least six-inch.
We'll see what the reality is soon, because traditionally, Sony has unveiled its fall flagship at the IFA International Technology Fair, which runs from September 1 to 6.
According to leaked phone transcripts, Trump pressured Mexico into paying for the border wall.
The Washington Post released transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and heads of state and government in Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump made a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the wall.
The president of the United States broke with him over the public condemnation of the wall, saying, "You can't tell the press".
Trump has upheld his campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first speech to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia have also been published, revealing a tense exchange of views.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the United States would take refugees heading to Australia on its own was "ridiculous", "silly" and "stupid", and that the deal made under the Obama administration would leave him with the impression of "a dead end" because he had offered a ban on resettling refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the speech by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant speech of the day".
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission has not yet taken any further steps to ensure that the public authorities are able to fulfil their obligations under the public service obligations.
The Commission has therefore concluded that the Commission has not yet taken any further steps to ensure that the public authorities are able to fulfil the obligations set out in the public procurement procedure.
This is the contract for public bus transport within the city of Tartu for the period from 01.07.2019 to 30.06.2029.
MRP Linnai appealed the decision of the Tartu District Court to the State Court.
The state court didn't take it up.
While many on social media complain that the weekend festival's vengeful noise is disturbing their nightlife and that the entire city is full of drunken partygoers, there are many who have nothing bad to say about the beach festival.
I'm even positively surprised that the parties at the store were so polite!
I didn't see any shame or disrespect.
I even saw kindness", says the brilliant Laine.
"It is good to be a guest, to be a guest, and to rejoice in the spring that has wintered like winter", he adds cheerfully.
The wave of the wave coming from the shore doesn't disturb sleep.
While living in the city center, he still heard music playing on the beach, now the music has not reached his home.
"But I hope to hear", he says cheerfully.
Agnes, speaking to the evening paper, says that the festival is more of a benefit to PÃ¤rnu - it will certainly help local merchants.
He is also pleased that so many foreigners have visited the summer capital.
No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. The party noise doesn't bother the woman.
I'm not going to be on the beach anymore, but I'm glad the beach's come alive.
And it's good that people are moving, and it's been three times", says the woman.
I think the first time was a little worse.
"Maybe there were complaints", he thinks.
But he says the noise on the beach is common to summer residents.
"This weekend is a very good promo for our small town", says Harry, a park cooker.
The spark and the mole have not touched his rhythm.
But what?!
We should all stick together.
Think of how this inter-ethnic communication would be better.
The man with the loud music doesn't get a kick out of it.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live nearby.
"Good people can keep things together and there's no harm", he says.
He says the guests who came to the fair are polite.
"They're a little overreacting to the details, of course, but the young are young and, oh my God, let's go, but be human and we'll get through it!" she says.
By then, coastal residents have traveled far away, either to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of noise", says Tiina, who walks with the children.
His family's dream of music festival doesn't interfere, though last year it went even further than it is today.
Last summer, the stage was the other way around, so we heard more.
We live outside the city itself, which actually flows quite well up there by the PÃ¤rnu river", he says.
Pearson's cutting another 3,000 jobs and cutting dividends to revive the business.
British education company Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividends by 72 percent, launching a new restructuring programme to address the business-threatening tightness.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission is not in a position to take any further action to recover the costs of the restructuring.
Pearson announced in May that it planned to cut costs by another Â£300 million (US$394 million) under a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business that has become a hoax due to the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell a stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that their expectations for the year had not changed since sales revenue was reported to have grown by 1% in the first half of the year to GBP 2,05 billion.
On Sunday, the weather continues to warm with heavy rains in the summer.
On Sundays, Estonia receives heavy rainfall with a chance of a sudden summer heat, with wind gusts sometimes very strong.
At night, the weather in Estonia is cloudy with clear skies.
It's raining in a lot of places, maybe a little bit of a shock.
Winds of 5-11 from the south and west, up to 14 on the islands and up to 18 m/s off the coast.
The air temperature is 13-17 degrees.
The day will come with changing clouds.
There's a lot of rain in the fields, and there's a chance of a tremor.
Winds of 6 to 12 are expected, with maximum sustained winds of 15 on the islands and 20 on the coast.
The air temperature is 18-21 degrees.
Convocation in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
Officials say a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the Qarabaghi district of the city.
The bombing is the latest in a series of violent attacks on Afghanistan this month, killing more than 30 people in a mosque attack in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night's blast occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with "a man-made explosive device".
The statement said all of the injured were in stable condition and were being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) are a growing force in Qarabagh and a serious source of concern for NATO forces in Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of whom about 20% were in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul, mostly in a Shiite neighborhood.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people - the deadliest military attack in the country since US-led forces toppled the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump considers increasing the number of US troops supporting the country's military and police.
The suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its politicians and in particular President Ashraf Ghani, according to the correspondents.
The EPA has withdrawn the decision to postpone the order after the lawsuits
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed the decision to delay the adoption of the Obama-era regulation requiring states to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, one day after 15 states filed a lawsuit against the agency over the move.
The EPA announced its decision to resume its "2015a ozone depletion operations" late on Wednesday, saying it demonstrates the agency's commitment to cooperation with states.
"We believe we need to engage in dialogue and hear from our state partners", EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June that the EPA intended to postpone the ozone content determinations - which measure ozone depletion in different parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced to meet the harshest air quality standard - for a further year until October 2018.
Fifteen predominantly democratic states filed a lawsuit Tuesday with the District of Columbia, saying the ruling was unconstitutional.
President Donald Trump's administration has tried to roll back a number of environmental regulations enacted by former President Barack Obama, which Trump says are part of a broader plan to market growth.
But these efforts have sparked backlash among Democrats and conservation groups, who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
According to the EPA website, breathing in oxygenated air "can impair lung function and increase the risk of respiratory diseases", such as asthma.
The German pigs may have a party.
German pigs and cattle may be feasting as heavy rains threaten the yield of the second largest producer of wheat in the European Union, Bloomberg reports.
This year, the weeks of harvesting before harvest may mean that the crops for the bakery are only suitable for animal feed.
"The quality of the soil is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015", said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeis.
This year, up to 40 percent of German grain could be used for animal feed, double the usual, Agravis predicts.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
At first, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, replaced by the hot spring in June.
In July Germany suffered a severe drought which continued into August.
Many eyes are on northern Germany, where rain is blocking the harvest.
So far, only five percent of the grain has been harvested.
Most of the region has not yet begun harvesting, local harvest buyer Ceravis said.
"These are really tough days", said Frank Deckert of Rendsburg, a Ceravis parent businessman.
The Finnish interior design plans may be a bit of a compromise.
Beautiful nature plays a role in the interiors of the fairs, as the large windows provide amazing views of the Saimaa mountains into the many rooms.
With each step, we see the efforts of our northern neighbors to create both strong and perfect (energy-saving) homes at the same time.
Finnish woodworking skills in building and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products are well worth admiring and following.
In the trade fair, both builders and designers can find ingenious techniques and clever solutions.
It is clear that the black, white, and gray shade arrangements, when supplemented by wooden planks and room frames, can be very emotional.
Good ideas can be pushed for another week, because the fair is on August 13.
Supplies and snacks suggest that this kitchen is often used.
Tonight, the line was pulled down to the street for the Weekend Festival Baltic and Martin Garrix was doing everything he could to be remembered as the last performer.
The crowd was really turning around during Garrix's performance - singing, dancing, dancing to selfishness.
When Garrix finished, a mass of common people was scattered from the beach of PÃ¤rnu to the city.
We're bringing you a gallery that includes all the photos our photographer took over the course of three days over the weekend.
I'm sure you're one of them, so find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face off in the fastest-growing boxing match yet in the 66.7kg weight class, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's Los Angeles office until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's lightweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over four-time world champion Adrian Broner on Saturday, both fighters are ranked in the top five in the weight table.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck".
Lomachenko is defending his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 7:00 p.m. on ESPN.
While posing for a few photos, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be "full-scale measurement".
"I'm a formerly secretive person", Garcia recalled.
"I've gained over 65 pounds for Bronner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a little short, about a pound.
I want to move down the lighthouse.
And he has to move up the lightweight, and then we can fight.
Fans have wanted it.
Let's offer them that".
Lomachenko has agreed.
"The world of boxing needs this fight.
Klimas questioned whether watching it should be worthwhile, as part of his strategy to have Lomachenkol debut in the 61.2kg class by the end of this year, to make next summer's meeting possible with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who is also interested in fighting Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell for the title after their lightweight title round at the Forum on September 23.
"Watching this fight could be rewarding because fans have wanted this fight", Garcia said, later saying he's open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are the key players.
No other name can get as much attention.
Whenever they're ready"...
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenk is a "strong fighter" and he can go see his Saturday game.
Lomachenko was modest in praising Garcia, however, saying that he felt that the three-division champion from Riverside was "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted it knocked out".
Garcia said the goal was to show off the punch and then box.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension between them growing for their wealth.
"It's a struggle that's waiting to be realized.
No other confrontation has attracted so much attention and attention.
I'm more than willing to work for it", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It's going to be a good fight".
What markets do they move from?
Mullu extended and issued a record 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have travelled to Estonia for work, study or family.
For example, when the decision was made to issue temporary residence permits to 6702 foreigners, the number of such permits was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis is being prepared by the Interior Ministry.
While about 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, in recent years this number has started to approach 2000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased steadily during the Ukrainian crisis, with 1087 temporary residence permits being granted in 2014, up from 675 a year earlier.
According to the Statistical Office, Estonia has the highest growth in the number of Ukrainian citizens - more than 850 Ukrainian citizens have arrived in Estonia.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia and due to the complex circumstances in the country, it is natural that the country is looking for work and study opportunities, where the community and many families are already in front", said Kristin Rammus, the press spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry.
The number of Ukrainians granted temporary residence permits was even higher than that of Russian citizens, although the most temporary residence permits have been issued to the latter in the last ten years combined.
If Ukrainians come here to work, it's Russian citizens coming here to work.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties to the people living in Russia", said Helina Maasing, a migrant researcher at the Academy of Homeland Security.
"If you look at where Russian citizens with Estonian residence permits have moved to live, East Virumia is immediately behind Harjumaa", he added, noting that about 40 percent of them are married to a citizen of the European Union.
Mullu was granted temporary residence permits in 1696 for Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians seeking to extend residence permits decreased.
"The jump is due to the fact that instead of renewing the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for to permanently reside in Estonia", explained Interior Ministry spokesman Rammus, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonian residence permits has remained stable for years.
For the purpose of permanent residence in Estonia, foreigners who have lived here for at least three years may apply for a new residence permit from the previous year.
It aims to encourage the adaptation of people to stay.
However, a permanent resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The new residence permits have probably also reduced the extension of the old residence permit.
For example, this type of permit was issued to 146 Ukrainians who had worked here for at least three years.
Now Ukrainians can switch jobs and the Estonian state no longer controls whether the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit was popular among applicants, including gray passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, there were 68 persons who received residence permits to reside in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Grussians and an equal number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has become a surprising country with some of Estonia's most active applicants for residence permits.
When three permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, it was 200.
They're coming from Nigeria to study at universities here.
Furthermore, Estonian higher education is popular among, for example, the Grusini, Chinese and Turkish.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased dramatically thanks to the education sector.
The rule also applies to them that wherever a community has emerged, others will be more easily added to it,' added Rammus.
In the last ten years, two people have moved to Estonia from North Korea, Laos and Madagascar, for example.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit per year, that is about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if the EU citizens are added, immigration remains at around 1%", Maasing said.
According to the Statistical Office, a total of 14 822 people travelled to Estonia, while 13 792 left.
That means immigration exceeded second-year outbound.
Most of the migrants are Estonian nationals, but more are among those who leave.
Therefore, the migration of Estonian citizens was in decline with 2000 people.
The Estonians mainly migrate between Finland and Estonia.
The princess of Mammu Couture is charming with satin, tick and butter
However, for Maria Tammeoru, the unfounded idea behind the painting is history - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours at a museum somewhere and admire old-fashioned handkerchiefs and crafts.
When you do something with passion, you're researching and learning about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mamma Couture may seem like a life-saving world to some, but the designer doesn't.
You decide how bright your life is!
I have a friend who's got a whole sauna full of haute couture dresses I made.
Because it's not her fault she doesn't live in Hollywood and don't wear a red coat every day, she wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and she does!
You can live your life special!
The artist doesn't recognize the gap between bright events and a gray day of rain.
This thinking led to a more ambitious plan to bring the high fashion in Estonia to rural areas, between forests and fields, to people, where fashion often does not arrive.
The collection of Mammu was exhibited at the fashion show in Pari, JÃµhvis and PÃ¤rnu, where 45 models of the royal parade filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, people often enter the store, they are honorably welcomed, but elsewhere, there are more emotions - they shout braavos, they stand up, they want to thank you with a wave.
A lot of the audience just came to hear, but now they're fans of Mammu Couture.
When you exceed people's expectations, they're thrilled!
And I like the feeling of being on a summer tour with my style.
We had a 50-meter-long red carpet on the floor, a street full of beautiful dresses, and it seemed like they never ended!
Maria also doesn't admit that the creativity has to be presented to a supermodel, she likes to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they're always happy to come.
It's such a lovely experience, you can wear a beautiful dress on stage!
I'm so sorry I never saw my own show, I'm always behind the scenes to give things the ultimate flavor as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to look quietly from the hall.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who doesn't just want to be a representative, but to be in everything.
I have my own stitching machine in the studio, I do most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process of you playing with the details, you discover.
I'm never far from my creativity and I'm not afraid of work.
It's not just design, it's styling, it's logistics, it's organizing, it's organizing - it's all just a woman's day in the world.
I guess the fanatics are gonna love these hours.
I can't tell you when my day will end, it's just a day full of joy for me!
I'm still very lucky -- it's like a continual stream of happiness: I do something beautiful, and the person gets something beautiful, and then compliments.
I've been told many times that my dresses have magic, they make me feel like a princess.
The elaborate satire sequences that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Muyrsepp of the U18 boys: the Estonian sub-group tournament weapon is now turned against us
Sorry, the story is over.
The first thing that came out was that we couldn't get our desk.
And if there's such a big gap in the table, there's nothing to do", commented the 61:75 loss to the U18 basketball team to Great Britain by our only NBA basketball player, BC Kalev/Cramo pitching coach Martin MÃ¼yrsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls off the offensive line and got so many more attacks because of it.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack, either, it hit.
Most British attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build a defense.
But in defense, they were able to hold hands everywhere, so we couldn't combine.
It's knocked the team down.
The respondents had done better than that.
Muirsepa estimates that Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes to reduce the pressure on the opponents.
Last quarter, we had zero errors, but the opponents already got a few quick shots.
The athleticism and the tight grip that was our weapon in the subgroup tournament turned against us.
We had no strength to fight their aggression today.
The wreckage was left in his care at Kalevis, at peace with Matthias Tas.
The tournament generally has a good word for the whole team, so far, they've had one hitter.
It's a shame we've met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup was always confident and played out today, but he seemed tired - he was carrying a heavy load.
But he did some of the most beautiful moves I've seen in training before", the coach added.
Terrible numbers: the girls basketball team scored less than 10 points in the EM Tournament by three quarters...
The U18 age group is not only the young men's EMI B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the girls started at the top in Dublin.
And the Estonian game against Poland, unfortunately, was a hit in the anti-record field.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter it was still 9:49 or only in the last ten minutes the opposing team took their foot off the gas pedal and the time was a mere 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia scored four, one point in the third...
In the first two minutes, the Estonians took two of the first four shots, then 25 shots, then one in three, and then another 21 shots.
Maybe in about half an hour, one of the 47 whales was caught.
Plus, two points from four free throws.
The losses were a reasonable number at the time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had a throwing capacity of 33 per cent and Estonia 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia started with two losses, and on opening day Portugal had to concede an 83:56 lead.
NATO ships have arrived in Tallinn to supplement their supplies.
Today, NATO's 1st Permanent Anti-Mine Group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit over the weekend to supplement the ship's supplies and prepare for the upcoming drills.
During the visit, the ships prepare to return to sea, giving the crew a few days' rest.
After the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to conduct several exercises and prepare for future historical exploration operations.
"The participation of the Estonians in NATO units and their cooperation training in local waters well illustrate our integration with the Allied forces", said Major Arto Reinmaa, commander of the Navy's Operations and Planning Division.
From 29 June, the NATO 1st Permanent Mines Group will be led by Lieutenant Commander Gvido Laudups of the Latvian Navy, who took over the duties of Group Leader at the ceremony held in Riga from the Estonian Navy Officer Lieutenant Commander Johan-Elias Seljamat.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian Navy support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also has the group's command staff.
In the same half-year, the international unit also includes the Estonian Navy minelayer Sakala.
One of the four NATO naval command groups, NATO's 1st Permanent Anti-Mine Group is a first-rate rapid-fire preparedness unit that the Alliance can deploy to different locations around the world within five days.
On August 4th, 13th, the ancient ruins of the Pirita Monastery will once again be the site of the Birgitta Festival, which was started 13 years ago by Maestro Eri Klasi.
According to Risto Joost (36), artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic, this year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
The Crusade: The opera world's classics include "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballet performances from the charming "Boler" to the funniest "Karlsson", and there is no plan for an independent production, this time a production of Joseph Haydn's marvelous "The Seasons" oratorio by the same international creative team that brought Haydn's second masterpiece, "Creation", to the Pirital stage in 2015.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theater performances.
It's bigger than any musical theater in its usual form.
It's a festival where the charm takes over and never really gets off the ground again.
Because the experience that the listener gets in this upper and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touches human consciousness in ways that are indescribable.
Risto, you're the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the Maestro's Special Class shoes seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with the E.R., it's been a lot of help.
He guided me through my entire student career and supported me in my early career as a conductor.
Maybe that's what makes it easier for me to keep doing his job.
Erika Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team, and of course it all goes to me.
It was great joining a team that knows exactly how things work.
The great heart of the Erythraean class gave me the strength to continue with the Birgitta Festival at the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could be the excitement for the festival tonight, what special offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, to our surprise, the first ballet written for Astrid Lindgren's story will be presented at the museum.
That's what "Karlsson flies" is for.
And one curious nuance is that the author of this ballet is Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this work.
He must have had a Carlson character in his soul since he was a child.
- Cristo, how are you doing all this?
I'm sure it's because of my supportive partner.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have a bunch of it.
And I've found that my personal emotions don't depend on other people as much as on myself, perhaps, how I deal with each new day.
And this conscious tone, this positive attitude, and actually smiling at myself in the morning mirror, significantly increased my happiness.
Especially this week, when the most important tests are in progress, I've been practicing it particularly diligently, and it works.
Smiling at the waist activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word.
I don't think people know half the things the universe has to offer them about their bodies yet, but I guess we all discover it gradually.
Now, now is the moment.
Do you have a ritual before you step on the conductor's desk?
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to trade clothes for more comfortable ones.
It's this little moment for yourself.
But generally, yes, I don't have a chance to rest before a big performance or get a little sleep.
In fact, I like to communicate with people actively, even before I join the conducting staff.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, there's something to discover, even for a friend of the great opera and ballet!
Watch the exciting video with Risto Joost!
New results of the age assessment tests of Swedish asylum seekers have been published
In Sweden, a test was conducted on asylum seekers to assess their age using a new approach to medicine, and the latest results show that more than 80 percent of those tested were over 18, but not everyone believes the results to be accurate.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
The tests were created to assess the age of the applicant for asylum in a more precise manner after criticism was leveled against the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) for failing to correctly determine the age of several allegedly minor refugees.
The Commission has therefore concluded that the Commission has not yet taken any further steps to assess the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
Eighty percent (2002) were estimated to be 18 years of age or older, and in 25 more cases, the Institute of Forensic Medicine estimated that the test subject "may be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the study concluded that the person was "likely to be under 18".
Tests shall only be used if the age of the person is under the question mark.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
"We don't see much difference from the statistics from the previous months, the numbers are pretty consistent", he told The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as being older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institute released 581 test results in May, saying that in 442 cases "there are indications that the person under study is 18 years of age or older".
But when Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of these 581 tests, it was found that in 243 cases, a person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of the vertebrae and MRT of the knee are taken and then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose job includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they have passed the normal puberty stage sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about it and I don't think the current measurement method should be used.
The biological age of the animals is thus very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, then we shouldn't pretend we can", he told the Metro newspaper.
But Johan GÃ¶ransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, defending the accuracy of the tests, said: "In general, the risk of an inaccurate child being aborted as an adult is low.
The greatest risk, perhaps at about 10 percent, is a little under 18".

20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made her debut at the London World Cup, finishing 18th with a mark of 67.37.
Orel was the youngest female heavyweight champion in the MMA, and a cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
I was able to keep my head clear on the first attempt (64.80), I took too much risk on the second (62.80), and on the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear", Orel said after the race.
I was looking for my throw and I'm so glad I found it.
Anna Maria O'Reilly's M.I. debut ended with a great 18th place finish.
The rain didn't bother O'Reilly, because he's training at the TT Stadium this winter.
"I'm being punished", he said with a little bit of a twitch.
London's Olympic Stadium was almost full of people, did Orel notice the people around him or was he able to turn himself off?
I got it, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it adds to the mix.
If you're competing, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will remain calm with his MMI debut and that he has many good competitions ahead of him: "I came here with the 32nd or final result of this season, finishing 18th.
That's a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and in the MM, that's all that counts.
I'm bringing a good experience and I want to compete for medals one day.
The governor of West Virginia announced a change of party.
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a meeting with President Trump that he was changing parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me", said Governor Justice.
"Today, after much prayer and reflection, I tell you, West Virginia citizens, I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor".
The gathering was filled with joyful cheers.
"That'll make me a Republican tomorrow", Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play another game".
Trump had earlier promised a big announcement at the West Virginia convention.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice didn't support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the state's only billionaire, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns the quarrying operations in the fifth state and inherited the quarrying business from his father.
His net worth is about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement Thursday night saying that "the governor Justice's party change is yet another blow to the Democratic Party that would rather prevent the country from becoming better again than work for it".
"Of the 15 governorships and the lowest number of controls over states in history, the Governor Justice announcement is simply the latest defeat for a party that is headed to the end and unable to find a positive and unifying message", RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News.
No wonder where there are many people, there are many injured.
Last weekend, Urmet, who was in the medical department, told the Evening Post yesterday that they had to give out a lot of plaster.
The bumps and twists are the basics, the twists and turns and the falls are easy.
And, of course, headaches, back pain, and leg pain.
Urmet says visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes and that's what causes problems.
Doctors have also had to help a few more seriously injured visitors - some panic attacks and one leg injury.
We have also made mistakes when a person has broken a hand or a finger.
We'll take the smaller ones here, send the bigger ones to the hospital.
See if the ceremony doctors are asking for painkillers to treat the condition.
Coe extended an honest apology to the Russians for the doping scandal.
International athlete Sebastian Coe said he praised Russia's "Honest Apology Thursday" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not the time to allow the sport back into the country.
Russian athlete Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships that the ban on his country is correct and that he has a strong goal to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the lightweight athletes who have won gold and silver medals in the competition".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to lift the competition ban imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation", IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself acknowledged that they had been through quite difficult times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the Federation".
Coe also said that he was pleased that Russia accepted its own criteria for reproduction.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the working group's proposal that this is not the right time to take back Russia", Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can in the next couple of months to normalize the situation.
We have always taken the principle of separating pure athletes from the corrupt system", he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the IAAF's strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the World Championships in Athletics starting in London on Friday.
IAAF Working Group Chairman Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia did not meet the multiple criteria for repeat.
After a report to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping controls were still inadequate and that banned coaches were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution is significantly changing the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution fundamentally change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say they win and lose at one point, it doesn't help for smaller mining companies.
Glencore now makes its money from coal and oil, but in the future, in the age of electric cars, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel will increase.
This year, the UK, French and Norwegian governments have increased their stakes in the distribution of electric cars, allowing for a ban on the sale of new fossil fuel vehicles in the coming decades.
Sestap has already announced that Volvo plans to discontinue its internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car to market.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, electric cars will sell more than diesel cars within two decades.
"In some metals, this changes everything", said Simona Gambranini, a raw materials analyst at Capital Economics, to Bloomberg.
We've already seen a huge impact on metals like caves and lithium, which have been in demand for years.
Electric cars have about three times as much copper as a regular car, Glencore reported.
More copper is needed in the charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that this will increase the demand for copper by around 5 percent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from the growing trend of electric cars from the rise in copper prices and from being the world's largest producer of coal, the Jefferies Group forecasts.
According to the brokerage firm, the second winners of the electric car competition are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, the London Stock Exchange has fallen 70 percent in price.
The price of Mullune was up 37 percent.
Copper has also been up 14 percent this year, mainly because of economic growth.
Glencore's shares in London rose 20 percent, having surpassed rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American by a price increase.
On the losing side are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine, who have to adapt to the new era.
The primary end use of the plug is the battery powering the starter of petrol and diesel-powered cars.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is used for other purposes to overcome the decline in demand", said Michael Widmer, head of metal market analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The effect of the downward trend on the price trend is not yet apparent.
This year, the price of lead has risen 17 percent, making it the best metal in London for rising prices.
Investors see problems with the metal in the distant future.
"I'm not sure that's so bad for the lead because cheap oil keeps regular cars in competition", said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at Triland Metals.
If the demand for lead drops, it's going to happen slowly.
Maybe it'll happen in about ten years.
However, so far, stricter emissions standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, which rely on lead-based batteries developed when starting their engines frequently, is increasing, according to the International Lead and Zinc Research Organization.
Light metals like aluminum replace steel, because lighter cars can drive farther with less electricity.
This explains the additional minimum demand for aluminium of 1,6 million tonnes already for 2013-2016.
It accounts for 2.7 percent of the world's total aluminum production.
Widmer said the trend is likely to worsen.
Aluminum has risen 13 percent this year as increasing demand from automakers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers are not sleeping.
AK Steel Holding is cooperating with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce car seams.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also working to develop a lighter alloy of steel to withstand the aluminium minimization.
"Excellent steel should be the answer to this development", said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil age could also bring suffering to platinum.
About half of this precious metal was used to catalyze diesel cars, said Johnson Matthey, a metal refiner.
"Many currently in high demand for raw materials such as oil and platinum may not have high demand in the future", said Natix raw materials analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance changes within 15 years.
Platinum producers believe there is a continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore CEO Marc Grynberg said that in 2025, there will continue to be more hybrid cars than full-electric cars sold.
The high prospect for platinum manufacturers over the next 10 years is hydrogen-powered cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motor that rely on platinum to generate electricity from hydrogen.
However, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"The diesel appears to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars", said Brunet of Exane BNP Paribas.
In July, German automakers were involved in a major retaliation because a court in Stuttgart banned diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche's hometown.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the uncontrolled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from making a world-record move from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body of the European game, which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League, are yet to come for Paris Saint-Germain.
The UEFA Fair Play Finance Rules (FFP) established in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar's move was financed without substantial losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy out the Brazilian, and Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to the French club.
PSG is undoubtedly able to spend such money to recruit Neymar and add to its roster, given that the team is financed by the ruling family of the Qatari energy crisis.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot to recruit players, but they have to balance that with the legal revenue sources that allow them to make their way in the football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA President in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fell into high debt in pursuit of success were actually engaged in fraud and risked bankruptcy if banks or owners were to waive their support.
Since 2011, FFP has focused on tracking club losses rather than club debts.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 at Chelsea - buying a potential club and then spending heavily to make the team better and build a global brand - is harder to implement.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor that is not a market economy investor.
And despite Platini's shameful rejection as president in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing overspending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules", Andrea Traverso, UEFA FFP observer, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar's purchase for the purchase clause in one full payment, they are able to break that amount down for accounting purposes into parts for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, which makes it possible to show a transfer fee of EUR 44,4 million per annum over the next five years.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a formal investigation into the alleged infringement of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
The club was fined EUR 60 million ($82 million at the time) which was later reduced to EUR 20 million and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-15 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may attempt to overthrow the regulatory financial institutions by raising their revenues through companies linked to the club's owners.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor in the form of a private investor.
The Commission also notes that the aid granted by the State to the airport was not compatible with the internal market.
It has been reported that a part of Neymar's PSG service may come from Qatar through the 2022 World Cup organising committee payments.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could be removed from the World Cup and claim that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a move.
The previous penalties imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in regard to any attempts to break the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed Neymar's move to PSG in advance.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they are not allowed to discuss the situation at PSG.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor in the region.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a positive impact on sponsorship deals, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club expects a turnover increase of at least 30% following the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football clubs, tried to prevent Neymar from making the transition, claiming that PSG was violating the FFP.
"This is a clear 'money doping' case with the club and the country", La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, citing that PSG is mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is part of the American sports giant, shares La Liga's concern that the country will fund the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the whole football scene over the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the fair game, because countries may have other ways or other interests to have such a great player represent the country".

Today, 50 years ago, a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia tore apart roofs and windows.
The storm of the century, which struck the mine on August 6 and 7, caused extensive damage to the West, Harjuma and Raplama.
In northern Estonia, winds were over 30 m/s during those days.
My old man ran from one tree in the garden to another, trying to support them with his hands.
It was all dark and raging, like the end of the world.
In Denmark, roofs were already flying off houses, recalled elderly Mrs. Linda Kurova Haapsalou in an interview with the magazine Eesti Loodus in 2002.
Linda's husband saw her planted garden fall apart.
But what are you holding with your hands, where can you stand a storm like this?
The sea came down the window, water poured through the windows", said Mrs. Linda Toona, who lived on Haapsalus Kalda Street.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station had flown 20 to 30 meters [20 to 30 feet] away, Linda saw, as did most of the shrapnel, only the next morning.
Locals say the trees behind the Paralepa were logically down, some completely down, some half-down.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm was going through the beautiful old trees ragin' and ragin' like war.
The West Virumaa was not particularly severely affected by the August 1967 tornado compared to the West Estonian one, but the damage was also considerable, Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
The Lossi Park and the Padis Park were cleared of the land, but our candy parks suffered greatly.
Wind speeds of up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour, were measured in Tallinn.
On the evening of August 6 in Tallinn, on the Sea of Galilee, a little girl screamed: "Mommy, mommy!
The birds are in the air and can no longer come down!"
The building at the FÃ¼lli Manor on the farmland was so damaged by the storm that it was later demolished.
The Tower of August was not able to withstand the construction of the mound of the mouth of the Pyrenees, which was later not restored.
On August 12, 1967, the newspaper Red Star reported that the cleaning of cities and towns from fallen trees and their branches was slow, and that residents could participate in the cleaning.
The storm also affected crops, and the newspaper reported that "party organizations must be both an inspiration and a guide in the repair and harvesting of crops".
Hurricanes can be described as having average wind speeds above 32.7 m/s.
The record of wind gusts in Estonia has been held since 2 November 1969, when the Ruhnul was measured at 48 m/s.
The wind speed measured there was not accurately recorded.
The Secret of Clean Water: Night cleaning and Bad Beach Weather
The colder summer conditions also mean less cleaning effort on Tallinn's beaches.
"If it's weather, there are people on the beach, and if it's not, there are no people", says a beach cleaner.
The beaches of the North Tallinn Stream are teeming with caiacs.
They are offered melodic competition by a tractor that slides at low turns and trips down the beach.
In fact, the last one creepes through the sand at a depth of seven centimeters, picking up seaweed and human debris - bottle holders, cigarette butts, and so forth.
People always come to the beach, whether the water is hot or not.
When the weather is nice, people are on the beach, and when they are not, there are no people", says Alexander Usov, the director of beach cleaning at the Habert Management, a subsidiary of the company.
It's 6:30 a.m. and there's a cleaning on the beach because at 8:00 the place needs to be clean for people.
Faith's at work as early as 4:00.
Besides the stream, he keeps an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, KakumÃ¤e and the Pikacari beaches of the Pale Islands.
Waste has been reduced.
Years ago, it was much more.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them", says Usov, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
It used to be that if something new was put up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're keeping what's on the beach.
Price of the clean beach
One of the biggest jobs on Estonian beaches is cleaning the beaches of the dried seaweed.
For example, on Pirita Beach, 400,000 tons of this must be removed after the seasonal season.
"This is an incredible amount", notes Usov.
The second big category is the core, or everything that people leave behind.
There are eight large garbage cans on the Straum coast, three times a week to clear.
That's a lot of garbage.
However, the colder summer weather has meant that there is less waste by a fifth than otherwise.
The third kind is the abandoned stuff.
Mostly children's games.
This time, Usov has a dozen model cars that have been rolled out of the sand.
They'll be waiting for the owners on the shore leading frame.
"They usually come out more, but this is a normal catch". The believer already knows that he will soon find them again in the sand.
The kids come to the beach and they take the toys to drown them back in the sand.
The beam is scattered
Erika Scholler, representative for Haabert's administrative services, admits that the tractor's handling is disrupting the local community.
The noise, which lasts from late into the morning, disturbs the sleep of the people living in the neighborhood.
But during the day, that's impossible.
You have to go to the beach twice a month.
"If we don't, the city will fine us", notes Scholler.
However, the aim is to make the beach of Stroom, like Pirita, Pikakari and PÃ¤rnu, an international blue flag.
"In Estonia, there is a lot more work to do to maintain the beaches than in Europe", says Scholler.
We have more mud and rocks and more sand to grind.
But there's less garbage on our beaches than anywhere else in Europe.
Hearing rumors of garbage on the beach, Martin, who lives near the Strait, unwillingly enters a conversation between a journalist and a cleaner, highlighting the current narrow spots on the beach.
There's a picture of the dirt everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle-keepers who have pulled up trash bags", Martin reports.
While it is hard to imagine that people will be able to change their past habits, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about garbage cans, such as putting blankets on them, at least to prevent birds from preaching there.
Overall, Martin is happy with the development of the Strom Coast.
It's obvious the city's taking care of it.
With paved, illuminated and freshly paved roads, it has become more pleasant.
Once upon a time, there was only one way to ride a roller coaster", notes Martin.
The inventory of the treasure in Stroomis: coins, only coins
The morning's measurement period has come to be used by 40-year-old Dimitri, who, as a treasure hunter, is combing the coastline with a metal detector.
He doesn't think he'll find anything of value today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough.
"I've been dealing with it for a year and I haven't found anything of value yet", says Dmitri.
As a hobbyist, Dmitri's wallet contains some euro coins, bottle cases, and even dangerous pounds, which he later throws into the trash can.
Usually there are coins.
"Gold, rings, and the like are not usually there", says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at their previous levels as weak growth and the slowdown in inflation have softened speculation on the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain flat because the perpetual income of households has put interest rates on hold.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6:2 in favour of keeping the rate at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for a rise this month as slow growth has weakened support for the rise.
The Bank also noted that the Bank's financial position was not in line with the Bank's expectations for the financial year 2017.
The Bank also noted that the increase in rates is necessary to control Brexit-related inflation over the next few years and that financial markets may need higher than expected increases in borrowing costs.
Members also voted a year ago to partially withdraw the economically viable mammoth package triggered by Brexit.
The Bank will end a fixed-term financing scheme in February, offering banks cheap funding, although it said it now expects a Â£15 billion increase in the scheme to reach Â£115 billion.
The Bank stated in the minutes of the decision on the rate: 'The mid-term MPC forecast is that the gross domestic product (GDP) will be invalid in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to affect consumption in the future.'
The figures show that a 'slightly higher level of leverage' is needed to alleviate inflation than expected in the markets.
The stock exchange is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any leaps were gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and the following year are comparable to the forecasts for May of 1,9% and 1,7%.
The forecast for growth of 1,8% in 2018 remained stable.
After the news, the pound's price against the dollar and the euro dropped.
The Nail fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes was prompted by recent disappointing growth indicators that have dampened growing expectations of growth - GDP rose in the second quarter from 0.2% to 0.3% over the previous three months.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up a bit towards the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice to families suffering from rising inflation and unwelcome wage increases, saying that the situation would worsen a little before it improved.
It added that monetary policy could not prevent a major income shock over the next few years, but a marked recovery in wages is expected by the end of the three-year forecast.
The weakness of the pound also stimulates the growing demand for British production, which partially compensates for the lower consumption.
The decision comes a year after the rates were moved to 0.25% last August following a shocking EU referendum that caused the pound to suddenly weaken.
The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully absorb prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's final decision, there was growing demand for a rate hike as inflation had increased pressure on households in tight conditions; in July, three policymakers demanded a 0.5% rate hike.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared with 2.9% in June, although the Bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess growth compared to the 2% target was due entirely to weakness in the Nail.
Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: 'Given the recent decline in interest rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive again as lenders are eager to work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock market appears particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are beginning to close, as refinancing, often at a free and low rate, has become increasingly popular.'
The NHS is prescribing a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people.
Patients will have access to 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment since September following a Supreme Court battle over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England has reported that NHS England is now making available to an estimated 10,000 people, during the initial three-year clinical trial, a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablet, which is given before intercourse and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection in high-risk people of around 86%.
The NHS agreed to finance the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court's decision last year that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite the Authority's own claims that the medicinal product should be financed by local authorities instead.
NHS England's chief executive, Simon Stevens, hailed the move, made public on Thursday, as a "new major intervention", while the National AIDS Foundation (NAT) described it as a "turning point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics to be added in October before the programme is widespread in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a set of HIV medicines taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trial results show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people with HIV infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that a person' s body has a sufficient amount of certain medicines to prevent HIV infection.
These medicines can be taken daily or at least two hours before intercourse.
Suitable candidates include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV infected and cannot receive treatment.
Clinicians will identify suitable people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transsexual people and those whose HIV-positive partner cannot receive antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate in the programme at the local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs Â£10 million and NHS England has signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week after an international procurement.
The objective of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and administered in large doses.
Stevens said: "This new, wide-ranging intervention should complement and intensify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against HIV transmission.
This is another milestone in over three decades of fighting one of mankind's greatest health problems".
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted to those who need it and are at risk, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at high risk for HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool, which can be managed individually and not depend on negotiations with a partner, through this NHS-funded clinical trial, thus improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement".
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The priority now is to ensure that the clinical trial is quickly pushed across the country and that no HIV risk group is left out.
Now that the drug for the PrEP clinical trial has been found, we're on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.
Deputy Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the clinical trial of PrEP is very welcome and has been greatly delayed after months of delays and government foot-trumpets.
Evidence shows how much this medicine can change the way HIV is prevented and the way it stops the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial brings us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that clinical trials are rolled out across the country as quickly as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society".
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia, but fell in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in the next day's electricity exchange rate between the price regions of Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to EUR 1,94 compared to EUR 7,71 in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the discrepancy is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
The average market price for electricity in Estonia last month was EUR 34,33 per megawatt hour, and the price rose by 12% compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36,27 per megawatt hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34,17 and the system price of the electricity exchange Nord Pool was EUR 26,37 per megawatt hour.
Prices increased by 12 percent and 7 percent, respectively.
The electricity between Estonia and Finland was 75 per cent of the hours spent in the previous month in the direction of Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours spent in Estonia and Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries were not spent on the next day.
The electricity between Estonia and Latvia was 99 percent of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 percent of the hours were in use.
The Nasdaq OMX market, which was trading on the last trading day of July, could be trading at around EUR 34/MWh in August and EUR 37/MWh in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the electricity industry rose last month and the transactions were carried out at a price of EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
High-rise residential, half-floor, and clever designs have made this little Earls Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate investor, traded her large Knightsbridge home for an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger plot of land", Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would match the price I was offering.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high tides.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day".
Since our first visit, this 93-square-meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Originally a single bedroom and a complex apartment, the kitchen was a walk-through to the bedroom, and Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half-floor to make use of the high bays.
"I wanted high bays, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands", he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed, an architectural and design studio in Notting Hill, to use the 3.8-meter-high creek to build a home that would not be just a development but a place where Joanne could live.
The deck was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half-floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
"The metal structure is quite complex", he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they would sit on top of each other without having to bow down.
It was not just a platform, but a steel structure to make the height of the upper and lower chambers right".
This arrangement enabled Erfan to create two full-sized rooms in the room, one on top of the other, with a wealth of dramatic elements.
The half-floor opens with an ancient bronze light to the glamorous living space under the retrovirus window.
The golden furniture with a mirrored surface, silver details, and the retrograde lighting of Serge Mouille emphasize the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatrical, spacious and light-reflective characteristics.
There are mirrors on either side of the short corridor to make it look longer.
The back of the kitchen mirror leaves the impression of a window opening into the other room.
The mirror box at the entrance provides storage for all of Joanne's food and glass supplies.
The living room adds the magic of the ability to close the kitchen when not in use, creating the imagination of a glamorous room.
Flexible kitchens are nothing new.
But the unique feature of this kitchen is that it is a garage-type lifting door.
"It was a little design trouble", explains Erfan from the steel-powered MDF door.
"It has a resistance, so it slides very easily when pushed up".
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne now has 16 square feet, an additional bedroom, and a better apartment plan.
"In the end, the floor is what you sell - or what gives the property value", says Erfan.
"A realtor steps into a room in an outdated form and calculates based on the floor area".
Here they have been able to increase the floor area using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
"Materials are what you touch and that help to build an emotional bond with the home", says Erfan.
"You don't like the electrical wiring in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the heart ring".
It shows that good design and increased surface area help make a fairly ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even make you want to keep going, as Joanne did.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a Chicago skyscraper hitman competing with his colleague for a promotion.
It's all about the money you make, and then you forget about any ethics.
He only sees his wife and three children in the early morning and late at night.
In the first half of the movie, I think it's a business version of the House of Cards -- even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler have a similar speech style.
The more the film progresses, the less the plot element remains, and the moral intent of the filmmakers is increasingly evident.
A life-changing experience for the protagonist is when his son gets cancer.
Now we have to choose between work and family life.
A son who dreams of an architectural firm makes his father walk into the great buildings of Chicago to think about the truly important things like faith, kindness, love... even the twin-tower disaster will not go untouched.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father's eyes, the filmmakers feel that they have moved on from the goal of making the audience cry, for even the most heartbroken viewer cannot help but cry as he sees the suffering of a beloved cancer-stricken boy.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, the father finally realizes the morality of his job and turns to an old man seeking a job of charity.
Now I bet myself that if the movie is happy, I'll be sure to get my transparency with coffee after the movie, but if I'm wrong, the writer can thank you for at least one surprise.
For a moment, I suspect I'm gonna miss a coffee when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and he slowly storms down the hallway to the palace.
However, the son has miraculously recovered, and although his father has just lost his job, this is also a positive result, since now is the time to take care of the family.
I can feel myself, too. I can predict the end of the American drama pretty well.
To the truth, the film is well constructed, with all the necessary elements.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morals are beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I think this movie will bring in a lot of good stuff.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's use of media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually handle it.
Then he'd be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information, including news, to President Trump in the hope of keeping his boss in the water.
Here's the breaking news reporter Josh Dawseylt:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with senior officials on his first day of work, he brought out a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to solve -- the passing of bad information into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the officials that information had to be passed through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he shared good information with him".
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it, and they've failed to track Trump's media use.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habits haven't gone away.
"If candidate Trump was upset about the unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was honestly portrayed in influential publications as well", said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, in February at Politico.
Politico's Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "six former campaign workers say the key to controlling Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media use also consistently includes praise songs".
- I'll see you later.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaigners know something the rest of us don't -- that Trump's whispers would have been even more inflammatory without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about any whispers Trump hasn't posted.
If his assistants were able to save him from trouble either or a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from continuing to stir up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the competing cliques of the White House, people are trying to advance their own interests exclusively by conveying to Trump material that supports their worldview, but may not always be reliable.
The Politico, which covers the whole story, wrote in May about the willingness of the advisers to provide the president with information of strategic value.
One example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is:
"Today's and former Trump officials say Trump may react to negative pressures, especially damaging news reports, in an explosive way, making it a hoax to reveal their source.
That's what happened in late February when someone happily gave the president a printed copy of an article on the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson's GotNews.com website accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the source of "a lot of information" in the White House.
It doesn't matter whether Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of the allegations, or whether he hasn't offered any concrete evidence, or whether he has made and withdrawn false allegations in the past.
Trump read the article and started to get his hands on Walsh".
Goldmacher added that then-Chairman of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Chief of Staff Rob Porter "has tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that reach Trump".
How did you do that?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still competing for influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians coming to the capital from abroad do not get permission to perform.
In the center of Tallinn, foreigners play a lot of music.
Those who spoke to the Nightclub admitted to playing in the Old Town without city permission.
First, we found three street musicians near the Viru gates who had brought with them as many dogs.
It was clear that musicians in rastafarian and cracked clothes were backpackers who would need a shower to get their fill.
Despite her appearance, the only woman in the group played a funny rhythmic song on the accordion, while a man was juggling her with three balls and inviting passersby closer.
A third man was sitting next to them in a backcoat and smoking a folded plunger in his own heart.
These three dogs wouldn't let the people pass by disturb them.
Naomi, who played the accordion, and Bob, who juggled balls, said that they played music on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the Society's performance was to raise the ticket money for the ship that was leaving for Finland that same evening.
When asked if they had asked the city for permission to perform in the old town, they shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Second, we never stay in the same city for more than a day or two, and we usually get permits for a month or something.
There is no point in paying for it", Bob explained.
When we got back to the Viro gates about 20 minutes later, we saw two women standing by the musicians and driving them away.
The community moved backpacks and dogs to the intersection of Viru Center to try their luck.
Also on the street were three young Poles, one of whom played the violin, the other the clarinet, and the third had a purported electronic piano.
"We are here to provide entertainment, to spread music and joy, and to make money for fuel and living", explained trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they know that to perform, they must have the permission of the city government.
"Of course we don't have it", she said with a laugh.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there's no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we'll go elsewhere, but we have to try", he added.
The Bank of Estonia purchased bonds in July for EUR 149 million under the Eurosystem central banks' public asset purchase programme, bringing the total debt portfolio of the central bank to EUR 4,36 billion.
The central bank will not disclose any more details on the purchases.
In response to a report by the members of the National Council, the President of the Bank of Estonia, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained that the Eurosystem central banks' asset purchase programme includes three different purchase programmes: financial sector covered bonds, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank shall buy bonds from the market to encourage investors who sell the bonds to invest money elsewhere.
The impact of the purchases will reduce the yield of lower risk assets and motivate investors to take higher risks.
In general, under the public sector bonds purchase programme, each central bank purchases government bonds of its own country, and the bonds of other countries are not purchased.
Since the Estonian State has not issued the bonds, the Estonian Bank shall make the so-called replacement purchase within the limits of the amount allocated to them.
The replacement transactions are also carried out by central banks in countries where the supply of the relevant bonds is restricted.
The Bank of Estonia will generally purchase bonds of European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank, upon Hansson's approval.
The Bank of Estonia will purchase bonds under the asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, the Elering bonds were also purchased, but as of June 2016, Eesti Bank no longer buys Elering bonds.
From June, the central bank of Finland will buy both Elering and Estonian Energia bonds on behalf of the euro area central banks.
Travelers ignore the order and return to the "millionaire district"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have again found themselves in a furious confrontation with determined travelers who have disobeyed the council's digging drawers to reclaim the field far from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 trailer-mounted villas outside the "millionaire district" of the wealthy near Salt Lake Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks since they were only thrown out of there in May, without being disturbed by the tie that the force had dug to prevent their invasion.
The tactical team found a weak spot on the defensive lines, pushing their vehicles through the unblocked area that had been left to run.
The Marouhas have complained to the Sollihul's parliament, saying the parliament is "useless in dealing with the problem".
An unnamed resident said: "They moved there Monday night after their assault on Bentley Heath, where they were throwing stones at passersby.
The board must be embarrassed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were kicked out, and now they're back.
They came last night, probably more today".
He added: "The Birmingham Legislative Council knows how to handle such matters by procuring long barriers to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to have to keep paying the electricity bill if the electricity bill can't even stop this".
One local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: "It's ridiculous. We just saw the last of these travelers leave, and there's already another attack.
This time the number has increased and the grassland has even been seen to remember the horse".
A representative for the Sollyhulli Legislative Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite on the land near Streetsbrook Road and we are working with the Sollyhulli Police to take the necessary legal measures to move them as quickly as possible.
The gathering of evidence is very helpful if as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help to create a court image of the situation when we present the case to them".
The weekend festival is also visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased that the real world's top names have been brought to Estonia.
When asked why Weekend Festival is so important to Estonians, Saar replied that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the three days of the festival.
But he's telling me there are real people in their field who have come to PÃ¤rnus.
"Given the level of artists that have been able to bring to Estonia, bringing home the absolute top names of this music genre - this is not often the case in our country", says the Minister of Culture.
But what festivals do the artists perform at that time talk about most of the island?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for grandparents like me, there's certainly one of the most experienced artists, Armin van Buuren, who took the stage last night.
"I think we all have been on our own at some point", he says.
But he's gonna come up with a few more names, like Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, we also have our own Estonian makers: starting with NOÃP and there are a whole bunch of them.
In fact, this concentration of known names is very high", he says.

Audi updates up to 850 000 diesel vehicles amid criticism from carmakers
The day before Audi announced it, BMW said it would offer software development for more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the BMW Chairman, the company believes that 'there are more sensible options than road restrictions', referring to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, which have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would renew three million Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engine emissions.
No company described these transactions as recalls.
European carmakers have been vigorously promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with carbon dioxide regulations.
But the nitrogen oxide extracted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment to be installed to neutralize the exhaust emissions of diesel vehicles for automotive manufacturers is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of lighting up powerful automakers and ignoring the signs pointing to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which silenced the use of so-called fraudulent devices that allowed the emissions sample to be adjusted to meet regulations during vehicle testing, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics unit of Audi's engine development division was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when authorities accused Audi of installing the system to circumvent European emissions requirements, expanding the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could be a major advantage for Volkswagen - the luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The European Union flag is being purchased for EUR 20 000 for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy the flag of the European Union for the Estonian schools to mark the Presidency by 1 September.
In total, 570 educational institutions will receive the European Union flag measuring 105 x 158 cm.
The banners are intended for display in interior spaces, they must be printed in high-quality printing techniques in interior spaces, including with tunneling, reports the ERR news portal.
The flag sign reads: "Give to the Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of the 570 flag is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education, or EUR 35 per flag.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect on the latest chaos in Sinaloa State, sown by organized crime, corrupt officials and the relentless drug wars.
But today, they've gathered under the cover of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They're told it's important to change their routine.
Two parents are discussing which seems safer: bringing the children into the office that was the target of a bomb attack in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board in front of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters to name every column -- no evidence needed, enough impressions and instincts.
Drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists are suspected of being hired by the government or cartels - a whole list of villains who make it dangerous to portray the chaos that prevails in Mexico.
The violence has no respite and the more bodies are accumulating across the country, the more journalists they make up - according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25,589 journalists have been under state protection since President Enrique Pena Nieto was sworn in in December 2012 and at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states so far this year.
The latest deaths include their editor and inspiration, Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist", Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug trafficking.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be felt everywhere -- a large picture of Valdez with a middle finger hanging on the facade of the Riodoce building with the letter "Justice", and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts depicting his smiling glasses-wearing face or his signature Panama cub.
The meeting is less than two months after her death, and reporters are discussing her trauma, her nightmares, her nightmares, her paranoia.
Although a separate public prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, the Committee to Protect Journalists has only prosecuted two cases.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organized crime murders, which number in the thousands, journalists' killers rarely get to court.
The Riodoce editorial board continues to reflect the violence that prevails in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data on the murderers and justice, Ibarra says a security meeting is of little use.
"It is very foolish to waste your time in this meeting", he says.
"Until the cause is known, you'll confuse everyone".
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He was only able to drive a few blocks before two men stopped him in a red Toyota Corolla, forced him out of the car and shot him 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates to "the 12th river".
The gunman drove Valdez's car away and crashed nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors are spreading freely in Culiacan.
But the subject of Valdez is mostly silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in the country as rival cliques battle to fill a power vacuum.
It doesn't matter if a few people are killed on the streets of Sinaloa every day or if the deadline is filled with lavishly decorated double-drug kingpin mausoleums, larger than many living houses.
For a moment, let's forget that peacetime refers to when a seaborne state with valuable ports and narcotics-related routes to the United States is run by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was thoroughly aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce co-founder and director Ismail Bojorquez (60) feels enormous guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes facilitated the killing.
The first of these was the publication of an interview in February with Guzman's sons, rival and wartime cartel boss Damaso Lopez.
This letter may have infuriated his son - the suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newspaper stores.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid on another newspaper that reported the same story took place.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be forever.
He worked for the newspaper Noroeste as a veteran reporter in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to form Riodoce, selling $50 worth of shares.
Bojorquez said Sinaloa "was impossible to handle the press without touching the drug problem".
The newspaper gained a reputation for its courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters enjoyed publishing high-profile investigations without fear of censorship and attracting readers to print stories that no one else dared to portray.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Caboti Prize for its Latin American coverage.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) for his courage in following Mexico's drug trade wherever it leads.
He openly admitted to being afraid.
"I want to live", he said, accepting the AKK award.
Last October, he told Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to take on the job of journalism - the other option is to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on".
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a comedian who crawled like a madhouse, a friend who kindly shared praise and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his coat.
He went across the street from his office to the bar in El Guayabo and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love was meant for him.
His death has also made them question how best to do their job and survive.
"They don't like you trapping their wives, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs".
"These things should not be touched", said Bojorquez.
Even at the best of times, the result is strong self-censorship and self-esteem.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's what happened with the Javier".
He and others say that Sinaloa no longer has the old rules, just as they do not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero or any other state that is home to toxic combination of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is changing all the time.
The room where Riodoce staff gathered for security training suddenly was no longer allowed cell phones; days earlier, it was revealed that only government-owned hardware was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers outside the house were looking for relief from the 40-degree heat in the shade of a tree.
The government assigned them to guard the Riodoce office, which is located in a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiaca.
Some reporters, in part, wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself has made unreliable.
It's been months since reporters drove to the mountainous countryside where the de facto control is in the hands of drug cartels.
This week's edition of Riodoce covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had a story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were abducted from the D.A.'s office in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was time to be careful when it came time to write what everyone in town knows -- the restaurant is a hot spot for drug dealers and the authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered with the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in a wide range of cases.
Villarreal asked a reporter to write about previous incidents at the same location, including how the son of Guzman, who we called El Chapo, escaped from the military.
Every few months earlier, readers would have looked up Valdez's column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known what happened", said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose modest bodybuilding has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels with our sources have been cut off".
The Valdez office has been given a storage space for banners and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff has been given something they never expected -- activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of posters and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning to protest another reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared in western Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
A burned body was found and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists have become a national voice, criticizing the phrase "SOS press" on the streets and buildings as an organized protest.
On that day, Director Bojorquez is out in Washington, D.C., trying to raise international support to bring the Valdez case to justice.
The day after Valdez's death, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of beating and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He then asked to be diverted from reflecting governmental actions, worried that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "confined in" by organized crime, state officials and the general public.
In his latest book, "Drug Times", he wrote that not only do drug addicts kill reporters, but they are also killed by politicians and security forces who are organized in the city.
The media monitoring group Articulo 19 reported more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and state officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you silenced", Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously bloodthirsty.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macia in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter, presumably signed by the Los Zetas cartel, that said, "I'm here for my news reports".
Next to his severed head lay a computer keyboard and earphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of their correspondent Miroslava Brech in March.
Others are going on like El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their boss in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed a drug cartel with the front page caption "What Do You Want From Us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
This is a nervous breakdown decision.
The exiles have a hard time finding work and they still have to guard the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes they are hunted, as was probably the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in 2015 in an apartment in Mexico three months after he fled Veracruz.
Those who stay and keep working have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, confesses that he is terrified of the drug trade.
"Mexico is on its way to hell, and that's why I started as a reporter", he said.
One late Friday at midnight, when the latest number had already been locked, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer when suddenly everyone's phones started vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were confirmed dead in a shootout between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued, as promised by several messages left by cartels found in the area.
On the side of the road, reporters posted the news on their mobile phone to the Riodoce website.
The next day, the front needed a change.
Sirens were rocking by... another round of gunfire in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the police on guard to see if they were awake.
If they were afraid, they wouldn't have shown it.
Under a massive portrait of the newspaper's founder, whose middle finger is visible throughout the Sinaloa, Riodoce staff edited his tracks.
"How could you even think about closing", said Bojorquez, "if the same day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send him to the streets to do a report?"
Dinosaurs used protective paint to ward off enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though it's quite scary.
Scientists have now published the first findings on the incredible presence of a tiny nostril found in a chicken quarry, which has survived so well that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
It has survived so well that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered in his fins was reddish brown and that his past had been somewhat "smooth".
A report in Current Biology described the creature as "the best-preserved dinosaur of all time" and "one of the best dinosaur species in the world".
The fossil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredible preservation was a shock to scientists who describe it as "truly remarkable".
This finely-covered vegetable-eater is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was discovered on March 21, 2011, by Shawn Funk while he was mining at the Suncor Millennium mine near Fort McMurray, North Alberta, Canada.
He found something that didn't look like the surrounding rock, and he decided to look closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrhenian Palaeontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was done to extract the animal from a 2,500-pound (1,100-kilogram) piece of land.
After all this hard work, the final result is finally ready for public release.
"A little eye-catching almost makes you think he's asleep", said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrhenian Museum, where the creature is on display.
"It will go down in history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur statues in history, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
Researchers examined his skin and found that the carnivorous, feather-covered, and walking tank-like plant-eating dinosaur was likely threatened by the large carnivorous dinosaurs.
This large-footed dinosaur used red and white protective paints to hide from predators and used a technique called counter-shelter, which is also used by many modern animals.
This enabled the dinosaur to better blend in and avoid enemies, experts say, since larger dinosaurs were likely hunting it.
This 110-million-year-old creature of the Nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrhenian Palaeontological Museum.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it Borealopelta after Mark Mitchell, a lab worker at the Mark Mitchell Museum who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exposing the animal to the harshest of conditions.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the personality, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the finch in the animal's body.
They discovered a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper half of the being was darker than the lower half.
Although shelter has become widespread, the findings come as a surprise, because the Borealopel is much larger than the shelter animals that live today.
This suggests that dinosaurs were hunted so actively by other carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred hiding as a survival tactic over a counter-attack.
However, most modern-day shelter animals - such as deer, zebras, and armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable to prey, suggesting that the nodosaurus had to struggle to survive.
"The intense hunt for the incredibly large, abundant fin-covered dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous could be", Brown said.
Chemical analysis of Finnish organic compounds also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was a red-browned crane.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the contents of its genitals, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur died in the rivers, reaching the ocean with its current, where it sank to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans likely extended farther inland than they do now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with the preserved finish skin, while remaining three-dimensional, maintaining the original shape of the animal", Brown said.
"As a result, the animal looks almost identical to the cretaceous age today.
It doesn't take much imagination to reconstruct it - just a twinkle in the eye and it feels like he's asleep".
The Cretaceous period was a time when the Earth was watched by two giant, moving flesh-eating dinosaurs - terrapods.
Although the king of all of them, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopel, this finch dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its fearsome predecessors.
Among them is the 38-foot-tall, six-tonne-tall monster Acrocanthosaurus.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was threatened after the Dead Sea and mummified in mud.
The existence was discovered on March 21, 2011, by Shawn Funk while he was mining at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved Finnish dinosaur in the world, including its skin and fins, and it is complete from the cones to the trunk.
These creatures were, on average, 18 feet [five meters] long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch-long squirrels came out of that shoulder.
Scientists believe that this fin-covered herbivore ventured through what is now Western Canada until a flooded river threatened its open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial site helped preserve its finer details.
The fossilized remains of this particular individual have survived so well that the skin remains still cover the mucous membrane plates along the dinosaur's heads.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: "This level of retention is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The stony skin remains still cover the mucous membranes of the animal's fur.
The right foreleg lies next to him and five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the Finnish possessions".
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was in a state of complete shock.
For the entire day after traveling to New York, this St. Louis resident was sitting in a room rented out of Airbnb in his bed, browsing Facebook on his phone.
He got the job after his old schoolmate.
It said, "A 18-year-old boy was just killed by police and he's still lying on the street".
He was confused why no one else had posted this information to his feed, so he shut down Facebook and started Twitter.
The @TheePharoah user's posts were repeatedly shared on his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area broadcast a live rumor about the death of an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body lying in the street, staying there for four hours.
"This is crazy", Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put his phone down, but later that night he saw another rumor, this time about a crowd on Canfield Drive.
Photos of police records and screaming people were shared, and a man claiming to be Brown's father held a sign that read, "The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He was watching a real-life stream where a police officer was standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In the second video, another cop reportedly grabbed a gun and shouted, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals".
Ferrell remembers thinking to himself, "This is unusual".
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to and what we might call typical".
I felt a little scary at that moment.
I was angry and I cried".
He booked a return flight and went home the next day.
Landing at 11 p.m., he went to his father's for his six-year-old daughter and decided to drive to Ferguson the next morning, both of them alone.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is central to the new documentary "Whose Streets?" that will premiere in cinemas on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the perspective of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets with answers.
As Ferrell and his daughter, wearing a floral dress and a crown that matched the crown, drove to Ferguson, they again discussed a subject they had heard many times before that morning - black experiences and living conditions.
"Remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right".
"I couldn't help but take her", Ferrell said later.
"What is happening now is... a culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow up in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activism and organizing, and at the same time, he needs to know the different layers of black experience and living conditions and what we need to do to be free and free.
Even if I manage to raise her so that she doesn't experience personal racism, she's no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would make a bear out of him if I could protect him from this world".
The first stop they made with Ferguson's forces was on the South Florissant Road, a stop across the street from the police station that had become a kind of campground where activists waited for news of Officer Darren Wilson, who was ultimately not charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunch.
They packed up the food bags and helped the protesters distribute them.
For Ferrell, a new kind of activism was slowly taking shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9", he said, noting that while a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Minority Student Union and focused on food rights and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organizing experience.
It just went away".
Weeks later, during an evening protest, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, co-director of a film.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were just trying to document what was going on.
Ferrell was asked, "Are you trying to document what's going on or find a story that can be used?"
Such skepticism was caused by the countless cases of people - often white - coming into the community and trying to profit from the pain and perseverance.
In a recent interview, Folayan explained: "We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not heard, and we wanted to do it differently".
Folayan had already shaken hands with co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row inmates.
His involvement made the project a boon for Ferrell and six other locals who were watched by the crew of "Whose Streets?" for years after the Brown shooting.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves", Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people were portrayed because that's how I was portrayed".
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement was not "led by a visionary but a community gathering", as Folayan put it - he became the most open-minded part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" surprisingly documents personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked", said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw the finished linseed.
"But I realized that doing this job and humanizing black people must come with a certain vulnerability".
Furthermore, Ferrell's story emphasizes and re-emphasizes the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who came up with the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media after the 2012 murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin are gay.
"In a very important role, black gay women have generally kept the movement in the field", said Ferrell, "and that's precisely because we have to constantly fight on multiple fronts.
Black homosexual women have to carry all that burden".
Folayan agreed, noting that "black women are indeed keeping the movement alive, and many of them are black homosexual women".
He also claims that "it is not about creating equal opportunities" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the film's focus because of his identity.
"He was a man with the right energy", she said.
"But it's no coincidence that she was right on the chest line, because as a black gay woman living at such junctions is a lot of risk.
Her energy can be felt through the screen".
Meanwhile, the cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
Ferrell's suspended sentence for blocking the road during the protest will last another two and a half years.
He describes the socio-political airspace in the area he calls home as simply "the food frenzy".
Yet he still holds the mantra to be important, which he has been remembering ever since he went to Ferguson's streets three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains".
7 Tips on How to Get Over a Difficulty After a Weekend Party
Some hardened men find that after a party with a sunburn, there is a problem, and that helps.
Or they're based on the saying "go out on a limb, stay drunk".
But it's just an inevitable setback and a healthy issue.
What can you do to make yourself feel better and recover from the grief as painfully as possible after the weekend trolley - or other party - this morning?
- Drink the water.
Alcohol down and up, after a big party in the morning... or even instead of alcohol if possible.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when it drinks alcohol, it has to be recovered.
Mineral fluids are also released from the body along with water, and a good source of drinking mineral water is the water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after drinking, it is especially good if the food is free of moisture or only slightly gassed.
Go for a walk.
Surely it would not cost to go to your grandmother with a hammer to cut down trees - a fateful mistake.
But a light walk helps the body recall what it feels like to be alive.
Laying on the stake and pulling out the stake is the most time-consuming way to heal.
Give your body energy back in a gradual and careful manner.
If you're still vomiting after drinking yesterday, there's no point in trying to load a big fat brown chicken with a stick.
For example, start with fresh juice that contains fruit sugars that are quietly marketed to your body.
If the southern area is already in poor health, you might want to try a pudding.
And a little later, the back.
- Avoid coffee.
This diuretics will rid your body of the last bit of water.
As I said, water and salt are your friends.
Don't bet on pain medication.
If you take a painkiller to prevent dandruff at night, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and lose its performance.
You're gonna ruin your liver even more, and the next time you get sick, it's gonna get worse.
Plus, the pain reliever doesn't last long in the body.
If you take painkillers in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach - it irritates your already sore stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you can handle yourself.
It works about the same way as walking, but walking doesn't give you an orgasm.
Avoid over-active pace and crazy spots - during the stretch, exercise should be moderate.
- You got to be kidding me.
Spend time talking nonsense to fellow carrier friends, do simple nonsense, and laugh friendlyly at yourself and others.
Nails and laughter may not make you feel better, but they certainly make it more fun to deal with the aftermath.
One day, the grass will pass anyway!
A Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are wanted for murder.
Police say they're looking for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee who became a suspect after a body of a man with fatal stab wounds was found in a Chicago luxury apartment.
Cook County court documents show that warrants were issued Monday for the arrest of Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for first-degree murder in connection with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Documents indicate that the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died of multiple stab wounds.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police got a phone call and found the victim, who was stabbed multiple times, on the way to the Grand Plaza apartment building.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators are considering the stabbing to be murder, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an email, Vice President of Public Affairs Alan K. Cubbage said Lathem is now suspended and barred from entering Northwestern University's campus.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is working with investigators", Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant in the finance department at Oxford University.
A representative from the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist the US investigating authorities in any way possible".
And the statement said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmo, the communications director of the Chicago Police Department, urges the suspects to turn themselves in.
"The police have a clue where they are, but we are working more and more intensively to identify the exact location", Guglielmo said.
According to Guglielmo, local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
Guglielmo said the police got a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic clue that something had happened in apartment number 1008.
According to police descriptions, it was a magnificent view.
According to Guglielmo, it is not clear whether the incident itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship", added Guglielmo.
Grand Plaza's management wrote to residents: "Police are currently working to determine the timeline of events and the background of the victims and are investigating various motives, including the possibility of a family meeting".
Businesses that help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the polls were in.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or, worse, misleading.
And even though he promised anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
"The system just wasn't consistent and objective", said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company that sells hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called out outside help.
There are emerging new types of startups that are human resources, helping companies figure out what their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software with a specific objective of measuring employee engagement, they enable companies to conduct quick inquiries, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with a hotline for anonymity and complaints, and in some cases allow language speakers to go past C-level executives and directly to the board.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your business?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint, a startup company in Redwood City whose software analytics tools companies use to measure employee engagement.
Errett says that in the three years he's been using Glinth, he's gained a much better insight into what his employees think and feel.
In addition to the sudden surveys and surveys targeting specific teams, it offers a company heat map that provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to explain the reasons.
Companies are beginning to realize that they need to stay up to date with their work culture so they don't become the next Uber, which has been mired in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing a harassing environment where those who dared to speak out were punished.
For startups like Glint, the desire to have a vision is a profitable business opportunity.
The global management, regulatory and compliance sector could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments, a financial technology statistics website.
Convercent, a Denver, Colorado-based startup that helps businesses prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a surge in interest and activity this year, fueled by Uber's dubious reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent lets companies send customized impulse queries, collect real-time confidential answers, and view heat charts from problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous message line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, the complaints go directly to the board.
"The public opinion has been harassed by regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to be mistreating its employees or behaving unethically, it could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee layoffs and legal proceedings, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the telephone number or e-mail address of the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday general counsel James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
But now that a company uses Convercent, there are potential problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices that previously hadn't been detected, addressed and addressed more quickly by executives in offices in other cities or states.
"I can get closer to a holistic 360-degree employee experience", said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees".
Quinlan said companies began to take ethical behavior, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, perhaps after the audit firm Arthur Andersen went bankrupt due to ethical violations in the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media got mature" that companies realized they couldn't stop their black laundry from being publicly laundered online.
"Before the use of technology to track ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a periodic fee for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has been approved by venture capital investors who have been supportive of both startups.
In February, Convercent was financed by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital for a total of $10 million, bringing the capital raised to a value of $47 million.
Glinti invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments are not surprising given the interconnectedness of enterprise, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that today's workers expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and exciting projects are just bets on the table.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and to dedicate their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in a company, they feel that they're being heard and that the work they do is rewarding, they're more committed to ensuring the success of the company", said Nina McQueen, vice president of the public benefit and employee experience division at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glinth.
Investors make a profit when the companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and involvement, it is no wonder that they are supported.
Employee participation data is important, according to work culture experts.
But that data is useful if the company's surveillance team doesn't start doing anything about it.
In fact, when a company asks its employees for feedback, it can create expectations that changes will be expected.
And if changes are not made quickly enough or not at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be ready for 4,000 conversations", said Russell Raath, president of consulting and business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying on too much data collection.
"Because when things don't work out, the employees think, 'Did you really listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts a staff survey once a month, was able to implement the measures on the same day the problem was reported via Glinth.
And after receiving feedback from employees who were disappointed with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams at the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays is gathering new data on employees and hopefully in the long run will bring with it a long-term commitment of employees to an industry known for its high workforce flow.
"If you're not committed to transparency, you're losing people", said Vitrano.
"And when you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses".
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltic: revenue is growing rapidly
While the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have affected the Baltic states, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the income of the richest countries in Western Europe, Bloomberg reports, citing a report by the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, GDP per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Success is driven by low debt, rapidly improving institutions, and business- and liberty-friendly policies.
'The Baltic States, together with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where real GDP per capita purchasing power is significantly closer to the EU average,' the central bank said.
Although the objective is to achieve a GDP per capita of Western Europe, in 2015 GDP per capita in the Baltic economies represented only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that were members of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement.
Low wages have led the Baltic people to seek better wages abroad.
While the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, the locals are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvians and Lithuanians estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather doing well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of the respondents felt this way about their countries' economies.
The NCAA's decision to cancel two-day training makes the Bruins' days long.
It's almost 11:00 when a trio of UCLA football players stop to chat at the edge of the team's new training ground on campus.
Some of them have been wearing shirts to expose their sweat on their backs from the first day of training camp.
For most of the team, these powerless guys offer a midday break.
After three hours of training, players will return to the gym for their final exams before returning to Wasserman Stadium for a 6:30 a.m. meeting the following morning.
"The next three days are a real test for them", said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel two-day training sessions to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least until they're halfway through the finals on Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three training sessions were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to fit the tight schedule of players.
The transition from two training sessions per day to more than one training session per day - the start of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season, and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons, training sessions are held during summer courses.
They have 18 practice sessions scheduled for August 20 before the official preparations for the opening game against Texas A&M in September.
Mora says he's in favor of the NCAA rule change, although it adds one more item to the tight schedule of players.
"They have a huge load in three or four days and it's a serious challenge", Mora said.
"And they break through this temptation; they strive, they are beautiful young men.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really fun".
Once camp is over, UCLA will shut down the practice, which is not an easy task given the clear views of the parking lot and downtown Luskini, a high-end hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have passed through the defensive grid around the gate.
Since this weekend, the Bruins have been hiring players at the hotel, but Mora admitted that there may be problems with the rooms being available during the season.
"We're putting in security measures", Mora said.
"It's a real concern, and it's not an exaggeration to think that people can rent a room and film a training session.
If you have a recording of a training session, it could be a pretty good deal.
But we're using a security team there and in the 8th parking lot.
We'll make the best of what we have.
I'm trying not to worry about it too much.
We have a plan".
The Savisaare-Ivanova electoral union, which was born in the Centre Party, formed in return for the union of the forces of Kristiina Ojulandi and Maria Kaljuste, who were expelled from the Reform Party, and the ECRE, which was forced to leave the ECRE, Our Tallinn and the party's constituent businessmen's union Acted in Tallinn - it seems that the electoral unions created on the initiative of the party's dissolution are participating in this year's local elections at least as much as the party.
But the tubes are counted in the fall, and the key question is whether they all have enough disappointed voters.
Who's staying with Savisa?
If Edgar Savisaare's support has dwindled to a small extent, you may notice his campaign for the union.
One member of the National Assembly, some former and current middle class and many unknown faces - can this be the constituency of the electoral union?
And can the reason why some of Saviasa's loyal supporters and friends in Tallinn are refusing to run for office be found in the fact that the "Saviasa's list of scammers" led by corrupt and suspected corruption offenders is becoming a reality?
Filmed on the roof of the city hall for a Russian-language pop song featuring an elderly LasnamÃ¤e townsman; and in every sense, the original computer game in which prime minister JÃ¼ri Ratas must ride a bicycle to avoid the bumps and squirrels that get in the way - is this the first time the Central Committee is seeking the votes of 16 and 17-year-olds allowed to vote in polling boxes?
Let's see what other parties think of a young campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 has been viewing a black box instead of entertainment since the beginning of August, there are two options: to accept that only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and France24 in English will be available for viewing in the future, or to hand over to some television operators on the tenth of each month.
There are probably those who, at first, publicly enjoy the free TV experience, but eventually - even if they are reluctant - pay for the telephoto and the ads.
The loud music, the loud crowd, and the noise left on the streets are just the unpleasant side effects of every major music festival.
If you don't want to be a part of the noise, it's worth going home and exploring the country instead of making a big noise.
Washington is changing the rules of the green card.
The media is quoting President Donald Trump as saying that a new immigration plan is in the works to change the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per year to 50,000, stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the president supports them.
The bill will be debated in both houses of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages, and saves billions of dollars in taxpayer money because it changes the way the United States grants green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce the honeymoon and replace the current program.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy", Trump said, according to US media outlets.
Young people from Siberia are moving to the city, retired people are returning to the country.
Yevseyev Anatoliy continues the tradition of the former gold miners of the famous Seto on the Mana River.
He works as a truck driver in a gold mine on the Kuwai River, 140 kilometers from his home.
It's hard work: two months straight without a day off, 12 hours of work, and then only ten days at home and back again.
In his three years at the Artel, Anatolia has only seen gold once.
"There is a tough time: you go in and you check to make sure you don't bring wine and you go out and make sure you don't bring gold", says Anatoli.
Mare Piho was talking to a local settler, Jan, in the village of Haida, who has told her a lot about her family's memories in Siberia.
The surviving archaic culture of the Siberian settlements is also beginning to affect the home settlements, because it is simply so amazing, says Piho Mare, who has studied the most distant settlements.
It's 30 years since his first expedition to Siberia.
During that time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many settlers still migrated to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
It's an unresolved issue.
I'm saying 8,000.
I figured it out from the stories of the Siberian satyrs who've thought about it themselves.
It's hard to say exactly, because up to 30 people could have been in a group back then, but the pass was only given to a man.
Pass was only given to one, but he had children, sisters, etc.
Look at the size of this territory!
It was many times larger than the historic Setoma.
It had to be taught, managed in some way.
The Setos came here as farmers, but their lives changed because they were in areas that were not only about agriculture, but also about rivers (salary savings), gold mining, industry.
For example, in New Petersburg, many sets later went to work in the secret city of Krasnojarsk-45 (which was built by the Soviet power as a uranium depleted city - J.P.) when it was formed.
Did the set make up the majority of the population in this area at that time?
Yeah, they lived in compact.
Moreover, the tradition of intermarriage and of having many children persisted for a long time.
Seven or eight children in a family were common.
How different and different was the culture of the Siberian set from that of the motherland?
They're different, even though what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of folk costumes.
They did it themselves, but they always distinguished between what was brought in and what was done here.
Climate change has greatly affected the traditional dress of the settlers, since it is colder here.
The food has changed.
Like, the meat salad in Setoma, but it's just frozen.
Where are the villages of the Siberian settlements and what kind of life is there? / Graph: Alari Paluots
The bond with her mother was strong spiritually, and it was considered very important.
I think now it's going to give Setuma back to them, affect them.
These girls who have lived here in families have heard amazing stories.
Piho refers to the delegation of Estonian Setos who came to Haida in early July for the day of the Seto Kingdom and stayed in their homes for four days.
What's left here is amazing.
"It's super easy to come and go because the city is a great place to be: at the crossroads and railroad junctions", says Reigo Tamm, an opera singer from Tappalo.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have plenty of nature, sports and culture, and pizza is everywhere.
Kill is the top city!
There's a small island by the White River that runs through town where killers tend to throw a party.
"This beautiful place does not look like a train window", Reigo says.
Anyone who's not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
On the river side, you can have a picnic and just have a romantic one - you can face the flow of the river and think about life before and after.
I've been out there with my daughters.
In addition to his work on three bridges across the river, Tamm, an opera singer, has also been practicing his areas: "Because this place is just outside the city, no one will come to meet you if you're telling your stories".
"The terrain offers a wonderful view of the Dead Sea, but there are also health trails where you can run, swim in winter and now play disc golf - golf is done, chains can be borrowed from the sports centre", says Reigo.
Old professors go there with their guns, of course, but I haven't gotten to play there yet.
I think we should invite our colleague Rasmus Kulle Kalla to visit because he's an experienced disc golfer and he has chains.
He's borrowing from me!
Reigo and the Mansion were inseparable from the childhood of the opera singer.
At least in the opening hours.
There's a lot of tears and disappointments left on this mountain and you can win my sporting life.
Not to mention broken wrists and mouths.
"The whole city center is now full of construction, and it's all going unnoticed", says Reigo.
But the old, tired, dead-end vault is a very attractive place to play summer solos.
I'm glad that in 2012, R.A.A.A.M. Director MÃ¤rt Meos accepted my idea and came to make his theater a summer theater in a waxy forest.
Although the theater season of "Aleksy Karenine" is just over, there's "Awakening" at the train station on August 11th, when you're moving around an old wax house in the 1980s.
"From August 11 to 13, Tapa City Days are open to the public, with a wide variety of cultural events, including a national fair, taking place in addition to the vacation hall", says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city on those days.
In a small yellow cottage on the 1st of May flower bed, the museum has been open since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are very large and the information is huge", says the Reigo site, which is steeped in history, with a focus on railroads and warfare.
Reigo hopes that if Tapal goes through all the recommended places, the stomach will be empty, but fortunately the small town is full of coffeehouses.
"We have such good restaurants and coffee shops, and sometimes you feel like you're out of the country", he explains.
Educated and young soldiers who come to the killing spends a lot of time in pubs and cafes, and sitting there is a strange feeling of being in Estonia and your hometown, but around you is such an international community.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from French or Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we have a lot of movement!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
The bTV channel quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying that two Bulgarians were being held under surveillance for illegal camping in Greece.
On the morning of August 1, police arrested two Bulgarians, including a group of people who had been camped illegally on the Sithonian Peninsula.
They were released the same day, but they're currently under investigation.
The Foreign Ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing strict penalties on anyone who is caught in a resting place not intended for that purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry says the court may impose a fine.
Puppies teach wolves to break sheep.
After a year's break, fish farmers must give the wolves "training material" from their herd again - probably the wolves who have trained puppies have already broken many sheep.
This year, wolves have broken sheep three times in Hiiu County, injuring 23 sheep and injuring eight, reports Hiiu Leht.
Mullu was only number three, 124 a year earlier.
The breaches also coincide with the Environmental Agency's data that no wolf pack was born on the soil of Hiiuma and the Hiiuma Hunting Council's information that two wolf pack have been recorded on the island this year.
On Monday night, wolves broke into 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in the Emmas Valley and injured 18 of the surviving sheep.
Early on Tuesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in the grazing area of the village of Reheselja and severely injured another, who had to be killed.
The rules for the handling of genetically modified crops shall be clear
The Ministry of Agriculture has sent to the coordination circle the draft law on the introduction of GMOs into the environment (GMOVS) and the amendment of the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment of the Act excludes the creation of a separate database for both GM crop sites and operators, for which the Plant Health Register will be used in the future.
In addition, the obligation of the GM crop operator to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in beekeeping in the intended radius is amended.
Although no GM crops are currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops.
This is at least until Estonia has decided to declare it GMO free", said Sigmar Suu, head of the Ministry of Agriculture's plant health department.
'At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors,' added Suu.
The Bill repeals the provisions relating to the GM crop location and operator data collection and handling training in the GMOVS, establishes GM crop handling and start-up requirements.
Specifically, in relation to beekeeping, the obligation of the GM farmer to notify the beekeepers of the start of the GM crop cultivation is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of the cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult the draft information system and to submit their views to the Ministry of Agriculture if they wish.
The planned changes will affect in particular the persons involved in the planting sector, the beekeepers and the Agriculture Authority.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop is allowed to grow, MON 810 maize.
However, so far no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
This is because there is no cornmeal in Estonia, a European sub-species resistant to the MON 810 maize line.
This corn is also cultivated in southern regions and is not suitable for our climate.
In order to ensure the safety of nature, the Ministry of Agriculture commissioned in 2015 and 2016 studies to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in the seeds of various varieties of suvirapse, maize and soybeans grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples showed that the seeds did not contain a foreign agent and the study concluded that the seeds of the varieties of rapeseed, maize and soy grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
The foregoing, in turn, can be concluded that no intentionally GM crops are grown in Estonia and that no accidental contamination has been confirmed.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United was recruiting a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has recruited "genius" Nemanja Matic after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The Â£40 million Chelsea player started in Dublin United's last preseason game before a 2-1 home win against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressing the defensive side, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were given free rein.
But after missing the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was barely out of the game and only lasted 45 minutes, which Mourinho said must be fixed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a genius mindset - he has a passion for football", Mourinho said.
"Let's help him get in shape as soon as we can".
Like Matic, other new recruits like Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at Aviva Stadium in the opening round and Mourinho quietly began to put his one-man starting line-up in place for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three more footballers, but he confirmed that the club had already done a "great job" by signing three of his four top-rated selections.
"I am grateful to the club for being able to make three out of four", he added.
"I'm even happier if they can do four of four, but they've worked hard for me".
Another hot kid got his foot in the GSM transmitter on August 1st, this time in the mouth.
According to the Ring's resident birdwatcher Matt Martinson, the first son of a bitch was equipped with a messenger in the Ring, and this pack is already flying around, has left the nest and joined the large nightlife pack of the Mullutu-Grandpa.
That's because there is no seed in the Ring, says the Voice of the Islands.
That Tuesday, relatively late for the roaring of the trumpets, another son of a bitch came to the sender and he was on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the deployment of the senders is actually an international project being carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Mullu was fitted with a motherfucker named Matt's GSM transmitter in the Ring of Turkey.
"Everyone can see what he does on the Internet: he goes to Spain for the winter, returns for a while at the German-Polish border, and then comes to the Isles", Martinson said.
The British inventor had a microchip installed in his body to get into the house and car with a handkerchief.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microphone so that he could just wrap his forehead open, get into an office, and even start a car.
Steven Northam, 33, had a small chip installed between his thumb and index finger, and now through his company BioTeq, he is offering this service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the installation procedure is in compliance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also exchanges the locks of houses and cars to match the cabin, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This married father of one has installed the technology now in both his home and his BMW Z4 that starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit went to pay taxpayers thousands.
According to military documents released to TIME, the White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South for an American production event last month cost taxpayers a reported $24,000.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the President's visit, was the centerpiece of the event to introduce American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials announced the manufacturing products of all 50 states on their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was displayed along with a Maine-based fighter, a Wisconsin-based fire truck, and a Mississippi-made cable car.
According to documents from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House war cabinet requested the presence of the helicopter, or FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern outskirts for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high-profile event", commander HMX-1 said in an e-mail to his commander, the deputy chief of naval operations in the aviation field, the day before the event.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the south yard on July 17th at 7:00 a.m. for the event, starting at 3:15 p.m. and would remain there until the yard was cleaned between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. that same evening.
The fact was added that if the departure from the White House is to be delayed, due to working time constraints, a second crew is required for the return flight.
The original flight crew was on the helicopter at the time of the incident and the crew security team remained close to the aircraft for the duration of its grounding.
The documents given to TIME magazine were not able to tell whether another crew was needed or not.
Hatch's law prohibits federal employees from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 was investigating whether this event might violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and we were told it did not violate", wrote the commander.
"You seem to have no choice", replied the deputy chief of staff.
The White House declared the event "Made in America" an official event, and Hatch's law would not cover it.
But even official events have political bastions.
The President supported the efforts of the Senate to reform health care at the time and praised the efforts made to keep government regulations in check.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for political gain is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents have to use them for travel.
But the requirement to use them for pure photosensing is unusual.
Trump came to the attention of the public in February when, at his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, a presidential plane crashed into the background, and his Twitter account was rife with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the presidential plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the 'Made in America' speech, which featured products from all 50 states made from American materials by American workers", said Lindsay Walters, White House press secretary.
HMX-1 teams frequently test flights around Washington and the South Rim to practice a one-centimeter drop-off at the White House for the President of the United States.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 hosted 58 trials in the White House.
According to the official, the flight was considered the norm for the "Made in America" flight crew for that month.
The squadron's helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-president-related support missions".
According to the White House, no other exhibit of this event was loaded into a taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky's representative, the company was not involved in the organisation of the south wing exhibition of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep budget documents for the presidential flights and the exact costs of the event are difficult to determine.
But according to the Department of Defense's 2017 annual hourly rates, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
The squadron's documents indicated the flight time from this base, Naval Air Station Quantico, Virginia, in both directions was 30 minutes.
The White House claims the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
'The calculation of taxpayer costs on the basis of the estimated compensation rates is very misleading,' Walters said.
'These estimated compensation rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs which are taken into account for annual appropriations.'
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to show this week the stuff made in America", Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
So of course, it's the right thing to do to bring it up".
It's unclear if Trump touched a helicopter while doing a tour of the South Side, but he was sitting behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to Sikorsky's representatives, making fun of the company's products in his personal jet fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the president, "I have three of their products".
Grit Shadeiko - Through Tears Peace and Joy
In the 2011 World Cup in Daegu, Shadeikot was hit in the final, running a 800m and being kicked out of the stadium with a candle.
Just before that, he had received a distance jump to zero at a university in China.
In 2012, he was injured in a car crash in Helsinki, but he finished 23rd at his debut Olympics in London with 6013 points.
The misfortune continued.
At the 2013 Moscow World Cup, Estonia's record record was set after the opening day with a thigh injury in the long jump.
Two years later, he finished 15th at the Beijing Olympics, meeting the Olympic standards, but he wanted more than disappointment for the athlete.
The heaviest cadillac was only in the ground when she failed to score a result at the Amsterdam EM.
I just want to put together a proper multi-race one once.
"Once", Shadeiko whispered.
Even worse was to come: A month later, his Olympic career was cut short by a shoulder injury in Rio on the first lap.
Time to take it down. Should we keep the seven-game series?
Is two days worth it?
She thought for a long time, but she found peace.
I was able to clear my head.
It's a pretty hard experience to describe, but I've been thinking that the last season and the Rio Olympics were just something that had to happen.
Fortunately, I had time to heal and clear my head.
"I knew I wasn't going to get my picture in my bag", says Shadeiko about her self-cleansing.
I was able to turn the page and move on to the next chapter.
According to coach Anne Berg, the suffering of a caregiver was very difficult to watch, but she understood that the athlete must first and foremost find out for himself.
He was so beaten down by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he would not give up and wanted to prove himself", says Mt.
He's got some peace now.
He's doing it for his own pleasure.
The competition returned in May when Å adeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the GÃ¶tze multi-race.
In high-level competition, he improved his personal best by nearly a meter (13.89) in the shot put and ran a record-breaking time in the hurdles.
Then the multiracial felt that it was not a skill set at all, but that it was only the first race hunger that was erased.
The mountain that has been coaching him for years says Shadeiko is a model student.
He's a ready athlete, he's good at training.
If something goes wrong or is wrong, he says it right away.
He knows his body and trusts his senses.
We have to start from there.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and we'll follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the type to train to the maximum", he says, adding that the most important thing is to get the right feeling because it also ensures good results.
The Happiness of a Neighbor
Good emotions have also brought happiness to Shadeco's loved ones.
Both her former trainer, Maris Berg, and her sister, Grete, recently became parents, and the multi-athlete has received support from new climatologists.
"It's been really interesting", says Shadeiko.
One alcohol that drinking is equivalent to training the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes wine can train the brain better than anything else in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
He did not say that alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts were the main thing, but that we were "very active" in the process of tasting wine.
When we sniff a glass, turn the wine in our mouth, enjoy it, and sense the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create the taste of wine.
Shepherd says wine molecules don't actually contain taste, but taste is created by the way wine stimulates the brain.
He compares the way the brain sees color.
"Taste is not in wine, taste is in wine", says Sheperd.
Other factors that affect the taste of wine include our age, sex, and even the amount of spices a person makes.
Shepherd, of course, remembers that wine is not for drunkenness.
"There has to be more to it", he says.
If you take too much of a stick, the system is overloaded.
Drinking too much wine can harm the brain rather than benefit it - a 2004 study found that people who drank more than three glasses of wine were at risk of memory loss, loss of balance, and mental impairment.
10% of Estonian ICT workers receive less than their colleagues
Data from the staff search firm Fontes reveal that 10% of Estonian ICT workers are paid less than their colleagues.
Ten percent of wages are between men and women, writes the portal Genius.
The remuneration survey of Fontese's ICT sector involved 59 IT and telecommunications companies.
A total of 8 577 posts were under review.
63% of the jobs were filled by men.
"While only three companies claimed that the wage gap was for men and the rest did not believe that there was a wage gap, in reality, men's monthly basic pay is on average 10% higher than women's and men's annual total pay is on average 8% higher than women's", said Fontese analyst Ilmar Pohjjala.
Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Cali cartel is in the middle of Netflix's hit list.
Despite the fact that the second season of Narcos revealed Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first of them has already been made to promote the new villains.
In season three, the DEA turns its attention to the world's richest drug-trafficking organization, the Cali Cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful Crusaders, "like Fortune 500 companies", simply with more government subterfuge and more violence.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz of London (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
A newly released commercial shows Pedro Pascali returning Javier Penana, a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement to help fight the war on drugs.

The UN says that the role of Afghan democracy in politics is up to women.
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN relief agency, said hundreds of women are running for local council elections, three women are running for vice-presidents, and more than 30 percent of recent registered voters are women.
"The importance of women's roles cannot be overstated", she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The Afghan local council elections and the presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have threatened to overthrow the electoral process, which will coincide with a transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes acceptable.
This year's election marks the first time that power has been peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women will increase the progress of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million women are among the 3.6 million registered voters.
The joy of sharing makes everything great for both the big and the small.
There's always too little time, but training with enthusiasts gives you a good opportunity to combine meeting, play, closeness and load.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you cruise in the summer, live lizards are always with you, impatiently reminding you with their tiny voice, "Let's get some exercise done now!"
Start with the warm-up - it's a good idea to play a regular gold game or to hang out on the beach.
The crib is the foundation for staying in the shape of feet and ash - who would want to take the shape of a sandbag that is worn out by waves during the summer?
It's great to use kids instead of a gang!
First, it's safe and comfortable, and the weight is increasing at the same rate as the strength of the trainer.
The advanced can also do the big ones.
The child exercises balance, reads repetitions, and enjoys the opportunity to be heard and to be important.
Older kids can do their own stuff at the same time.
The range of motion is achieved by touching the ground and stretching out your hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the miniature to hold it properly.
A kid can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
The plank is superfluous, but hopelessly boring for the child.
But it's easier to have fun!
Game board: take a long plank column from which to pass the turntable.
It's actually harder than usual, but it's a lot more fun when you can shake hands with a friend.
To add to the load, you can stay on the plan, on a small platform, and walk around in that position.
An extra exercise may be to put a younger child on the stumps, but this exercise is fun for all children.
While crabs are sibbing in the sand, triceps, scabies, and abdominal muscles become infected.
The child will step on his feet so that his body weight is evenly distributed in front and behind.
For safety, you can hold hands.
Bend your legs and stretch straight up.
The joy of flying, of having fun, of balancing, of being difficult.
A little coach's life is an extra-long, if he gets a little kiss every move.
The extra load is due to the stretching of the legs.
Make sure your back is in a neutral position.
Kids have a lot more fun doing their stomach muscles in pairs and plaques.
Hand-to-hand and pulse-to-be.
Keep the baby safe, kneel, and keep your back neutral.
All the kids' favourite and fun!
But for the parent, it's really effective whole-body exercise.
The sports equipment included the Ott (10), the Shade (8), and the Happiness (4).
From the Philippines, a journey to the heart of the world
Fall-weighted bags are a classic of summer, which in recent years have become a hot item that a right summer sailor must hang on his hand and which traders have been able to add to the hot price tag despite its modest origin.
A bag of falling water is probably one of those things that has existed in every single one of our lives and that has never caused any special emotions.
It just exists, and if it doesn't, then nothing's broken.
But now shoulder bags are making a real triumph, and fashion fans have traded their fine designer bags for simple shoulder-weighed bags for summer months.
Not only is it a beach bag, but it is now as popular as a street bag, and even more courageous women walk into offices with it.
But before we know it, it's worthwhile to make sure that the boss still has a summer suit or a notebook and push the laptop into a slightly more formal sumadan.
But the wealth of change has made the shoulder bags the true summer love of women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing you notice is that when you go on a vacation, you are attracted to the local market and you buy a pair of shoulder bags that you can then be loyal to for the rest of your vacation, and that goes along with the beach, the marketplace, and even hanging out with your friends in the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a larger quantity of bags from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is noteworthy, however, that the demand for bags is so high among readers that in the real world women (and men!) would likely go hand in hand to one another in order to become happy owners of some bags.
In some ways, this madness is understandable, for there are few times in the fashion world that you can buy a hit for just a few hundred euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple way to make money here, and thus the finer luxury brands sell beer bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably just so the richer customers don't feel like they're being a simple whore walking around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a shoe bag for Dolce & Gabbana for over â¬1000.
However, the interpretation of the Channel shoulder joint may cost around EUR 6000.
Unlike most fashion models, shoulder bags do not originate in any major fashion, but their story began much further.
Rather, shoulder bags are said to have originated in the Philippines, where they have spread widely.
The burden of the bags is on the exporters, and the locals are not seen walking around them very often.
The brewing technique is said to date back to the 14th century and is quite similar to ordinary cask brewing.
But since a beer bag does not have to be as heavy as a basket, it can be embedded with patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and thus more attractive.
For example, recently, bags with colored paints or leather pens have become particularly trendy.
Shoulder bags can be sent first, but most of all, to actress Jane Birkin, whose biggest weighted shoulder fan has never been seen before.
She was able to fit a beer bag into all kinds of clothing sets and didn't even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
The popularity of these bags today is not only diminished by the fact that they are a heap of care, but also by the fact that unlike other bags of any kind, they do not need special tools to be kept in place, and that they are also washed away by water and a wet towel.
As with trendy news, there have been brands that have come out with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you want, you can buy a shoulder-wrapped skirt or a small shoulder-wrapped bag.
But it's worth remembering that a classic beer bag never goes out of style, but it does go on the shoulder.
But what's a classic beer bag?
For centuries, a shoulder-drawn bag that resembles a basket in style has been considered a classic, with a wide opening and short shoulder-drawn trays.

On the island, a man who disappeared three days ago was found.
Aare left his home in the KÃ¡rla library on Wednesday night unknowingly.
Aarega was last in contact by phone yesterday, Friday night, and the phone's location gave the man his location on the West Island's Bay, the village of Pleasant, where he was searched by helicopter until midnight and dogs until early morning.

GMB is concerned about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The company expects confirmation from the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie of its long-term production plans at its Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent on the future of the investment in the Tollcross facility.
The Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies and other products are produced at the plant, which employs more than 500 people.
McVitie's owner, Pladis, said they've invested more than Â£5 million in the property over the past couple of years.
There were hired workers and union leaders who "are the first to hear" when something changes in the factory.
In a letter to the company's head of facilities, GMB Scotland addressed McVitie's request to 'resolve concerns that the funds will not be used to modernise production lines'.
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy commented: "The fact that we do not receive clear information from the facility's chief executive on Tollcross' business needs and future investment plans deeply concerns our members.
The workforce is made up of a large number of local communities and people from the Glasgow area, which is essential to provide more decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social exclusion.
The East Glasgow region therefore needs a firm with a strong growth in productivity in McVitie, in terms of jobs, wages and wellbeing, and in the context of Brexit, rising living costs and a chronic decline in production.'
A representative from Plade said: 'The Tollcross head of the facility received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company replies directly to it, as we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between employees and GMB representatives took place in Tollcross, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with the staff that, like all other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain economic environments, we are continuously reviewing our activities - and this applies to all our businesses and facilities - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: 'Over the past few years we have invested over Â£5 million in the Tollcross facility, most of which has been spent on production lines and operations improvement.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility and if there are any changes to the operation of the facility, the employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it.'
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about approaching Neymar?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up trying to lure Neymar into their ranks by making a Â£189 million buy-out offer, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record-breaking invasion?
This tough approach has opened the summer transfer window and the Ligue 1 club is poised to break more than double the current world record set last season by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for Â£89 million.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, who will be paid over Â£500,000 a week by PSG after his payment.
Barcelona are known to be angry at both the approach and Neymar's release, although a source close to Catalan's management says the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world about this possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs considering recruiting some of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will meet them and contact them", Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with any of our players, they'll have to face the consequences".
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave on any condition and that Barcelona could retaliate by losing one of its precious assets to Neymar.
Prime Minister: After Brexit, Ireland wants to build a bridge, not a border.
"Brexit seriously threatens to strike a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the UK and Ireland", Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland since his resignation in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it", he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects have made it possible for the free movement of people and goods to exist today, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders", he stressed.
According to the investor, he would prefer Britain to remain in the European Union and, since that cannot be done, to remain in the single European market.
It would preserve the existing free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The second option to make Britain's departure more smooth would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish Prime Minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could certainly have one with Britain".
The alternative would be to return to customs, which would herald a historic break-up and political failure.
"Go to trade, prosperity and peace", said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that the outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily life.
The Irish prime minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland on a visit to Belfast.
After his first semi-final, Martin Avand, Ironman, anyone can go.
Today, the Winter Olympics were held in the Baltic States, hosting the largest triathlon festival in the world, with nearly a thousand athletes from over 30 countries competing in the semi-finals of Ironman.
The 70.3-mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, MÃ¤rt Avandi finished the first triathlon of his life with a victory.
"I thought it was going to be difficult and it was going to be difficult", Avandi said in the finale.
Despite the complexity, Avandi has proven that triathlon is actually a rich head for everyone.
"No distance kills, but the pace kills", he said, implying that with a pace that is within reach, everyone can reach the finish line.
Except for Ott Sepp: "Oti is fine with physics, but unfortunately he can't swim".
Avandi had been training hard since February.
At first, four or five hours a week, but later, it's been ten hours a week.
With a time of 5:34:12, he finished 270th overall.
Although Avandi lost to Raio Piirola (time 04:59:53) and JÃ¼rgen Ligue (time 05:06:37), he won other competitions in the so-called "prominents class".
Last year, Tanel Padar, who was a "good example of a person", lost to Avandi by seven minutes (5:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan by 16 minutes (5:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm by about an hour (6:31:53 and 06:45:18, respectively).
The overall winner of the men's event at the Otepapi stage of the Ironman series was the German Johannes Moldan with a time of 3:58:27, the Estonians best time of Ivo the Great was 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Danish Helle Frederiksen won with a time of 04:24:01, while the Estonians Maria Jannese, who lost to Frederiksen by almost half an hour, finished with a time of 04:58:58.
The opening took a 1.9-mile swim in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in position 410.
