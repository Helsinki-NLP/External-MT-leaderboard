The total number of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) increased rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The overall number of new coronavirus (COVID-19) infections in the European Union/European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom indicates that, although the prevalence varies from country to country, the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on the Italian experience, countries, hospitals and emergency departments should be better prepared to handle the large number of COVID-19 patients that will require care, especially in the intensive care setting.
On 31 December 2019, a case of pneumonia caused by an unknown agent was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the infection was caused by a novel coronavirus now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Current evidence suggests that approximately 80% of people infected with COVID-19 develop mild respiratory illness, i.e. respiratory illness that may or may not be associated with pneumonia, and most of these individuals recover.
In approximately 14% of patients, COVID-19 results in severe disease requiring hospitalization while in the remaining 6% it results in severe illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we assess the overall incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to the incidence in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK with those in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 has continued to spread to other countries and the global trend of COVID-19 has been similar to that of China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri and colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO patient definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were confirmed in France on 24 January 2020 in people who had travelled from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been reported in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), resulting in 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths between this date and 31 December 2019, of which 17,750 cases and 1,4441 deaths were reported in Italy alone.
Determining the overall number of COVID-19 cases and the overall prevalence
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the COVID-19 case numbers reported by country worldwide, which are only provided by official sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 am.
This data was used to analyse the status of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare it with Italy.
To provide an overview of the current status of COVID-19 infections, we have aggregated the number of COVID-19 infections over 14 days, focusing on the natural transmission pattern of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also show the number of cases each country has reported as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 compared to Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
The status of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
The overall trend in COVID-19 infection rates in the EU/EEA and UK has been stable for 14 days, similar to that in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
In general, in the EU/EEA and the UK, COVID-19 cases began to rise around 21 February and will peak around 28 February 2020 (Additional data).
This was mainly due to the sharp increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK, which saw an increase in COVID-19 cases (Additional Notes).
Figure 2 shows the average number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK and Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
This shows that, as of 15 March 8:00 am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported total cases equal to or less than Italy's total cases 3 weeks earlier.
Our conclusions suggest that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases will increase rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Changes in the overall number of COVID-19 cases suggest that the epidemic is spreading at the same rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries have varying test standards, varying healthcare practices, the definition of infection may vary from country to country, and there are different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including testing those who have failed to be tested.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy explained that up to 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already received an insufficient number.
Data on hospitalized or intensive care COVID-19 patients currently available at EU/EEA level is currently only 6% and 1% of patients (data not reported).
However, it needs to be collected in a comprehensive manner to aggregate the data for the current follow-up focusing on the number of patients diagnosed and the number of deaths.
A 201011 study found that the availability of intensive care units and intensive care units varies widely across Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less facilities than Italy (they had 12.5 emergency and non-emergency beds per 100,000 population in 201011).
The sixth update of the ECDC's COVID-19 Rapid Reviews provides examples of the number of patients over capacity, accompanied by a comparative estimate for each EU/EEA country and the UK of COVID-19 patients in hospital and a 90% estimate of the number of beds in intensive care.
As some areas in the EU/EEA and UK are still the most affected areas, and hospitals and emergency rooms are typically only receiving patients from a specific area, information on patients and emergency rooms should be available in the Regional Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) database.
The Italian case and the situation in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care facilities should be prepared for the continuing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring care, especially in the intensive care setting, as is the case in the affected areas of Italy.
As outlined in the recent ECDC rapid response assessment, it is important to adopt a rapid and early public response strategy to contain the spread of SARS-COV-2, and thus replace home-based prevention as a preventive measure, as the expected increase in patient numbers could leave decision makers and hospital administrators with insufficient time to analyze, agree on appropriate measures to take and take action if not taken early.
A quick assessment of the issues indicates the public health measures to be taken to mitigate the impact of the outbreak.
There are few opportunities for countries to improve their response to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its health impacts.
If this is not done, it is possible that healthcare providers in other EU/EEA countries will face a large number of serious cases in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, thus posing a threat to humanity.
Like other similar viruses, SARS-CoV, which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by ticks and has similar symptoms and symptoms.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and less lethal than SARS, although it is more transmissible and more common in older people than in younger people and more common in men than women.
Due to the rapidly increasing number of reports of this new disease, this paper attempts to provide a comprehensive and useful overview of this emerging research topic.
We focus on basic knowledge such as the disease's identity, cause, virus, diagnosis, treatment, transmission, and prevention.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this test will help identify and eliminate this life-threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has already made history as Chinese people were asked to stay home for the entire holiday and for several weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the new virus.
This virus has many similarities to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; the World Health Organization (WHO) therefore named it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the resulting disease is now called CoV 19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and has since spread nationwide and to some 50 other countries worldwide.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed, of which more than 40,000 have been discharged and more than 3,000 have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the world's No. 1 public enemy and that its impact could be even greater than that of terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 have been published, including on the virus, its etiology, its origin, diagnosis and treatment since the first report was published on 7 January 2020 describing the viral patterns of various patients.
This review attempts to summarize the current research on this emerging and highly researched topic.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-borne diseases, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, which emerged in 2012).
We will review lessons learned so far on how to contain the spread and the cause of the disease as well as some of the urgent questions that remain unanswered.
CoVs, which are generally considered non-lethal viruses, are the most common cause of influenza A with a prevalence of about 15%.
However, in this century, we have experienced two major human-causing CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused epidemics in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and subsequently spread to many other countries with numerous infections and deaths.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third most recent CoV pandemic in human history.
As shown in Figure Figure 1.1, cases of influenza of unknown cause were first reported to the China National Health Commission in Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the first description of the CoV was published.
The first death in Wuhan was reported on 15 January 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has spread rapidly to other cities, counties, and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that some doctors had been infected, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted between humans.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed under a quarantine and all public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had arrived at the Wuhan sea-based treatment facility where the suspected infection was from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of publication of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and to approximately 50 other countries worldwide (Figure (Figure 2).2).
Due to the rapidly spreading epidemic, the extent and impact of the outbreak is uncertain.
As of 11 February 2020, a multi-institutional study of 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 has provided a more up-to-date picture of the epidemiological status of the disease (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infections are of various ages, but are most common in people between 30 and 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50 years old, a small number were under 20 years old, and only 14 cases were under 10 years old.
Men were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 is most prevalent in Hubei and surrounding areas.
On average, COVID-19 has been observed for approximately 5 days (2-9 days) from the time of detection to the time of diagnosis.
It took an estimated 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) for the symptoms to appear.
The first death was estimated to have occurred 9.5 (4.8-13) years after the first case.
The baseline infectivity value (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the baseline R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases increased significantly before January 23, 2020, coinciding with the peak of travel before the Spring Festival in China.
The rate of confirmed infection was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the overall mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main outcomes for COVID-19 were gender (men), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a large class of single-stranded viruses that contain a single strand of RNA.
They can be classified into four subtypes, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.In this subtype, alpha and beta CoVs are the only ones that can infect humans.
The head glycoprotein (S) binds to the ACE2 and DPP4 molecules in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the cells are then fused.
The viral RNA genome is transcribed into the cell; once the viral genome is copied, the genome RNA together with the glycoproteins bind to the nucleocapsid proteins and form the nucleotide bonds that bind to the plasma cells to produce the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was identified on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new strain of beta-CoV with a gene homology of 99.98% in 10 genomic samples collected at the outbreak site, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 has a much more similar genome to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
In the electron microscope assay of infection, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the thin surface of human respiratory epithelium.
ACE2 in humans is the gene that is found in both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 gene much less than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the observation that SARS-CoV-2 infects patients less severely than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also be a new short protein produced by orf3b and a newly discovered protein produced by orf8.
The orf3b protein in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 protein does not contain any known structure or structure.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou and colleagues reported the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) model of the full-length human ACE2 nucleus at a depth of 2.9 Å in the amino acid B0AT1 transitioning membrane.
They found that the complex, which has an open and closed structure, is assembled as a double chain and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins, which is a sign of CoV viral transmission.
B0AT1 may be targeted in the testing of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The animal from which it was first isolated
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans from donkeys and camels.
Using the comparison of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, it was determined that the two strains are SARS-CoV-2 derivatives because the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-like CoVs derived from the strains bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the first animal infection that allowed the virus to become multi-species has not yet been identified, and the mode of transmission is not yet fully understood.
Ji and colleagues suggested that snakes may have transmitted the parasite-borne virus to humans via S-protein binding.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, reported that the leopard, a long-beaked mammal that is a major source of infection for Chinese medical practitioners, may have been the first known case of SARS-CoV-2 due to the 99% genetic variation identified in the leopard CoV virus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference observed in both genomes is still large; therefore, conclusive results are expected (Figure (Figure 33).
Many of the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses can survive in the open air for up to 48 hours in a warm environment, and up to 5 days in an environment with temperatures below 20 °C and humidity between 40% and 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar features.
It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to exposure to sunlight and to temperatures of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, cholera disinfectants, peracetic acid, choroform, and other oil-based solvents, but not cororegisidine, can effectively kill the virus.
The general population is not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this novel virus.
Currently, there is no extensive research on the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 response.
Therefore, we only base our findings on previous studies of other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4).4).
Generally, once the virus enters the infected person, it is first detected by the immune system via the proliferation-receptor (PRR) complex, which includes C-type reginine-like receptors, TLR receptors, NLR receptors, and RLR receptors.
In various ways, this virus causes fever, inflammation of the immune system, and accumulation of intracellular protein I (IFN) produced as a response to the virus that reduces viral spread and increases the infectious virus's resistance.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus develop immune defenses.
After a short time, the immune system begins to fight the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play a key role in the immune system.
CD4+ T cells complement B cells to produce antibodies that can fight the virus, while CD8+ T cells immediately kill the infected cells.
T helper cells produce cytokines that help to protect the cell.
However, CoVs can degrade the T-cell function causing T-cell death.
The intestinal immune system contains receptors such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies extracted from a recovered patient have inactivated MERS-CoV.
Furthermore, the overwhelming resistance of the immune system leads to a large number of disabled cells in the body that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst case, the failure of various organs and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was first identified in the infected population, is more common in elderly people with a variety of underlying conditions and in pregnant women.
People who are highly infected or have a weak immune system are often at higher risk of infection.
The average duration of incubation for SARS-CoV-2 is between 1 and 14 days, with a peak incubation of 3 to 7 days based on a study of the first 425 patients in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 patients showed that the time to symptom manifestation is 3 days in general and ranges from 0 to 24 days.
The most recent study, as mentioned above, showed that the time to onset of symptoms was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a sample of 8,866 patients.
It is important for health authorities to determine the appropriate time of day based on the actual time it takes for symptoms to become more apparent, thus preventing people who are infected but not asymptomatic from infecting others.
Normally, people who have been exposed to or infected with the virus are required to quarantine for 14 days.
What if the gestation period is extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first serious symptom of COVID-19, which may be uncommon or accompanied by other symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, sore throat, diarrhea, headache, sore throat, frequent colds, chest pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and vomiting.
Some patients have experienced difficulty breathing or low blood oxygen levels weeks after the onset of the disease.
Severe patients were more likely to experience severe respiratory problems, low blood pressure, and metabolic and blood clotting problems.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even if they do not exhibit any signs of pulmonary problems, should be screened for the virus early.
A patient-group study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the overall symptom response was 98% for fever, 76% for chronic cough, 55% for oxygen deprivation and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients requested ventilator support.
Similar findings were presented in two recent studies of familial transmission and asymptomatic transmission.
Similar to this study, a 2012 study of infections showed that MERS-CoV patients also reported fever (98%), whooping cough (47%) and oxygen deficiency (55%) as primary symptoms.
However, 80% of them required ventilation than COVID-19 patients and the mortality rate for MERS was higher than for COVID-19.
Throat pain (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
Among SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), whooping cough (29%-75%), oxygen problems (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the most common symptoms and patients who required ventilators accounted for approximately 14%-20%.
As of February 14, the overall incidence of COVID-19 was 2% while the global confirmed cases were 66,576.
As with this virus, the mortality rate for SARS was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases in November 2002.
For MERS, based on the June 2012 infection survey, the fatality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies have shown that the baseline infectivity ratio (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47, the 95% infectivity ratio (CI) was 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptom, mortality and R0 is shown in Table Table 1.1.
The reported data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal.
The presence of the virus in the intestine is not a cause of infection.
The virus is often found in the same family or in the same gathering or vehicle as the boat they travel on.
Patients are usually either previously travelled to or living in Wuhan province or other affected areas or have been in contact with infected or sick people in the two weeks prior to their diagnosis.
However, it has been shown that people can be infected with the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who recover and are discharged from hospital may still have the virus, suggesting the need for an extension of the quarantine period.
Patients have a normal or low white blood cell count (mostly stem cells) in the first few days.
For example, the low white blood cell count was &lt;4×109/L including the platelet count &lt;1×109/L, and high levels of aminotransferase (AST) and viral load were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver proteins and chemicals and myoglobin were increased in the blood of some patients, and the accumulation of liver proteins and erythrocytes was increased in the blood of many patients.
In severe cases, D-dimma, a marker of the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, was elevated, and the number of cells decreased.
Problems with bronchial filtration are seen in many COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral obstructions or GGO pulmonary embolism.
Patients often develop severe asthma, acute pulmonary ulcers and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), heat, fluid accumulation and pulmonary edema are the major limitations to airflow.
Type I and II pinemosytes decrease the volume of fluid and increase the volume of fluid between the lungs, thereby decreasing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of pulmonary failure.
Therefore, adverse radio-frequency reactions are often associated with the severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first analysis of COVID-19 virus detected pinemositis, inflammation of the pulmonary veins, respiratory cytoplasm, and polycystic heart disease in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, which coincided with the origin of viral infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as in SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by laboratory RT-PCR was used as the primary target in the COVID-19 assay.
However, due to the high rate of false positive results, which could potentially increase the spread of the disease, the test was introduced (no longer limited to RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
This was also the case with the SARS test.
Therefore, the combination of the medical history, symptoms, laboratory tests and ultrasound results is important and necessary for a successful diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, a team led by Feng Zhang described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK method to detect SARS-CoV-2, which isolates the SARS-CoV-2 RNA subunit at a rate of 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of the enzyme) using a vacuum tube in less than an hour without the need for sophisticated equipment.
There is hope that this new approach could significantly improve the quality of clinical trials.
Due to the lack of familiarity with new CoVs, physicians may primarily be in close contact with COVID-19 patients while testing various prescription or preferred therapies to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral infections (Table (Table 2).2).
These medications include active and potentially active antiviral drugs, immunosuppressive drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, plasma extracted from healthy patients, Chinese herbal remedies, and psychological supports.
It is expected that plasma extracted from recovered patients will be used to treat the virus.
Pharmaceutical companies are developing the drug to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is primarily pathogenic to the liver and can also infect, at low levels, other ACE2-producing organs such as the liver and kidney.
However, respiratory malfunctions and dysfunction are the most common health risks and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential for symptomatic relief and survival and includes general ventilation, high-level ventilation, moderate ventilation and ventilation due to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be treated with ECMO, a cardiopulmonary bypass system used to treat patients with severe cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of renal function, prevention and treatment of other diseases and low blood pressure, maintenance of vital cell function are also beneficial for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that increased cytokines are caused by an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine surge is a mechanism of the inflammatory immune response characterized by the release of various cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to release large numbers of neutral proteins, which are the main causes of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is useful in the treatment of cytokine deficiency, especially in chronic patients.
Corticosteroids and tossilizumab, a single-coronation antibody that is anti-IL6, have been used to treat cytokine buildup.
Other immunosuppressive agents for treating cytokine deficiency include: suppression of the immune response to T cells; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; anti-tumor; inhibition of cytokine signaling; and inhibition of HDAC.
Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of the immune system's effects.
However, the use of high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs did not affect the severity of lung ulcers in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it can cause serious complications, particularly osteoporosis (AVN), which can have a significant impact on the outcome of the disease.
However, it is desirable that low and moderate doses of corticosteroids be administered to patients with severe COVID-19 for a short period of time and with reasonable risk tolerance.
At the time of writing this report, a new antibody had been identified in a healthy individual.
However, the injection of remdesivir, which is similar to nucleotide, has been shown to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg virus infections.
Subsequently, remdesivir was also shown to inhibit other RNA-dependent viruses including MERS and SARS.
Based on the above, Gilead has provided China with the vaccine for two human studies of SARS-CoV-2, with highly anticipated results.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been shown to be effective in treating patients with symptoms of severe respiratory distress.
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and other serious complications may occur with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with other medications used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma extracted from recovered patients by immunostimulation
The collection of blood from people who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat others with the same disease or to prevent the transmission of the disease to non-infected people has been a long-standing practice.
Yes, healthy patients usually have higher levels of antibodies to the virus in their blood.
The immune system is a globulin (Ig) immune system that is produced by B cells to fight viruses and other foreign substances and to identify and destroy only the viral molecules.
Based on the above, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and then injected into 10 patients in critical condition.
Their symptoms began to improve within 24 hours, accompanied by a decrease in inflammation and viral load and an increase in blood oxygen.
However, further analysis is required to develop a model for use in a broad population of patients while the development of specific therapies is ongoing.
Furthermore, due to the effects of the drugs, some of the adverse effects associated with plasma should be considered with caution.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune system and thus trigger the production of cytokines, which can be life-threatening toxins.
The number of antibodies in the blood is usually low and more plasma is needed to treat patients with severe disease.
It is not easy to develop specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global pandemic.
It is therefore necessary and desirable to extract B cells from healthy patients to either encode the genes of the active antibody or to test the active antibody against the essential proteins of the virus.
In doing so, we can actually restore the function of the immune system.
For thousands of years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to treat a variety of conditions in China.
However, its mechanism of action is largely based on the combination of different drugs in a variable manner due to the disease profile based on the techniques used in TCM.
Many of the effective drugs are unknown or poorly understood because of the difficulty of obtaining and monitoring the drugs or their metabolic activity.
Currently, due to the lack of a specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the most prominent complementary therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients who have already experienced improvement.
For example, the drops of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been shown to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
These high rates of recovery for COVID-19 patients were observed in several Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87% of their patients, such as Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), and Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, with the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is an unbiased estimate as many other factors such as the number and severity of patients must be considered in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of WM with TCM using only European and American therapies.
They found that the time required to return to normal body temperature, symptoms and hospitalization were significantly shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
Interestingly, the rate of symptomatic severity (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (7.4% vs 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM is still subject to further extensive research in a larger population and in many institutions.
It is also desirable to provide a description of the mechanism of action of these drugs and to clarify the components of TCM that are effective in either alone or in combination, if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 often have a higher risk of infection and death, and those in isolation are more likely to have a poor response, isolation and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, respiratory problems, cough and adverse drug reactions such as insomnia due to corticosteroids may contribute to anxiety and psychiatric disorders.
During the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a variety of psychiatric conditions were reported including chronic depression, anxiety, panic, panic attacks, fainting, depression, and suicidal tendencies.
Contact tracing and quarantine enforcement as part of COVID-19 response by public health authorities may lead to increased anxiety and guilt over the impact of infection, isolation, and discrimination against family and friends.
Therefore, mental health services should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases and contacts, and to other people who need help in general.
This emotional support should include the establishment of a multi-agency mental health team, a clear and regular exchange of up-to-date and accurate information on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the management of the patient and the use of digital tools and applications to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are important to prevent transmission between animals that are in contact with the virus and infected humans and other animals or humans that may be infected with the virus and often complement antiviral drugs in the fight against infections caused by new viruses.
Efforts are underway to develop vaccines based on the S-protein to develop long-term antibodies to the virus or to enhance the body's resistance to SARS-CoV.
Vaccines using weakened viruses have been tested in animals for SARS.
However, the efficacy of these vaccines in healthy elderly and critically ill animals or humans and in protecting against animal-derived viruses cannot be determined until clinical trials are conducted.
This may be because 17 years after the SARS outbreak, there have been no new cases.
On the other hand, a few cases of MERS have been reported in the Middle East and the virus has spread to other regions due to the continued animal-to-human transmission in the region.
Immunization strategies for MERS using engineered viruses, DNA parasites, viral vectors, microorganisms, virus-like particles and self-replicating protein particles have been developed and some of these strategies have been tested in animals.
The development of an effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for people with compromised immune systems is a necessary and urgent part of the response to the pandemic.
However, this is difficult to address due to the long time (approximately 18 months) required to develop a vaccine against mutated CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has begun to show a remarkable recovery in the thousands of cases.
Patients can usually recover without any side effects.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also highly contagious and fatal in patients with severe disease.
Therefore, the development of a cure for this disease is necessary to ensure that hospitals and clinics can effectively use their services or in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted to date, the following factors may influence or be associated with the development of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33)):
Age: Age is the most important factor in the assessment of the progression of SARS, and the same is true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was most prevalent in those aged 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% being over 50 years in the 8,866 patient study described above.
Patients who requested intensive care were more likely to have other medical conditions and were significantly older than those who did not (average age 66 years vs. 51 years), suggesting that age is a factor in the mortality of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: According to the latest data, men are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
Multiple complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to have severe, severe, and convulsive heart failure.
Cardiac failure was also a major cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 can also infect ACE2-positive lymphocytes, which may cause liver complications in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and disease are strongly linked and can affect each other.
Laboratory findings were unusual: The level of circulating protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of tumours or joint ulcers and has been identified as one of the potential factors in disease progression, drug response and recovery.
A link between CRP levels and the severity and progression of COVID-19 has also been demonstrated.
In addition, high levels of LDH, AST, ALT, and CK can also predict the outcome of treatment.
These tumors are most common in various organs, especially the heart and spleen, and are released when organs are damaged.
Therefore, they are the most common indicators of heart or liver problems.
Critical symptoms: Chest piercings and transient symptoms should be considered along with other issues in the planning of COVID-19 outbreaks.
Anti-inflammatory drug use: As mentioned above, anti-inflammatory drugs are anti-immune drugs that are commonly used as adjuvants in the treatment of infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of the immune system's effects.
Because the high dose of corticosteroids was used extensively in severe SARS patients, many patients who survived developed osteoporosis with a combination of permanent disability and poor health.
Therefore, when necessary, patients with COVID-19 should take low-dose anti-inflammatory drugs for a short period of time.
Mental fatigue: As noted above, during the COVID-19 pandemic many patients experienced extreme fatigue due to prolonged isolation and severe depression and the loss of close family members and loved ones.
It is important to provide immediate counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from severe depression and return to a normal life.
Based on the patient studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have a different manifestation from SARS.
In addition to infection of the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also enter the respiratory tract of the throat and nasal passages and cause mild to no symptoms in the first days of infection, as with other common influenza CoVs.
Therefore, patients who are infected in the first days or while taking precautions to prevent symptoms may have a higher viral load than normal, making the response to the disease more difficult.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV has been shown to occur in patients who are in advanced stages, as most cases are diagnosed in the early stages.
This is why the COVID-19 pandemic is more severe and more resistant than the SARS pandemic.
Currently, there are several measures in place in China, including a quarantine in Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuing quarantine of almost all residents to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have severely affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating that the epidemic is slowing down.
The most optimistic forecast is that the outbreak will end in March, and the population will return to normalcy in 3 to 4 months.
But some experts are less optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues found that COVID-19, which appears to be more infectious than SARS, will not be eliminated by 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues developed a model for predicting the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in chest and throat samples from recovered patients 2 weeks after discharge from hospital, suggesting that the new virus could be reappearing as a common cold.
But there is some encouraging evidence in China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that the measures may be working.
Initial estimates of the number of Ebola cases were one million and 500,000 deaths.
But due to strict quarantine measures, the disease was contained.
As with SARS-CoV, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 infects fewer people and then becomes either a deadly or a less deadly human-to-human virus.
A comparison of COVID-19 and SARS and MERS outbreaks is shown below (Figure (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and can also be acquired through contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been found in the urethra, suggesting that there may be a new transmission pathway to the oral contact of the urethra.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of patients may have been infected by hospital-acquired infections, including 17 patients with a history of other diseases and 40 physicians.
Therefore, greater vigilance is needed to protect individuals, especially physicians, social workers, relatives of patients, co-workers, and even travelers who may come into contact with patients or infected people.
The first preventive measure that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of medical masks and N95 (type # 1860s) masks help to prevent the spread of the virus.
Medical masks help prevent droplets from a potentially infected person from traveling through the air or onto surfaces, and then spreading to others.
However, only the N95 mask (class # 1860s) can protect against the airborne virus at 10 to 80 nm, with 5% of the virus being able to penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are at 85 nm.
Since some parts can pass through five adjacent medical masks, physicians who frequently contact patients should wear N95 (type # 1860s) masks instead of the standard medical masks.
In addition to wearing face masks, physicians should wear specialised clothing to further reduce the risk of exposure to the virus.
Viruses can also be transmitted through the faces.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; this means the virus may have entered his body through his face.
Therefore, physicians must also wear protective eyewear or special glasses when they are caring for patients.
For people generally living in areas that are infected or at risk of infection, it is important that everyone wash their hands frequently with antiseptic soap, try to self-quarantine by staying indoors and avoiding contact with people who may be infected.
The recommended distance between the patient and the patient is one and a half meters.
These practices are an important way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered humans as a novel virus, the fact that it has many similarities to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have prompted China to take a cautious approach given its recall of the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured the public that the new virus is highly contagious and that human-to-human transmission is low, so controlling and preventing the disease is not a problem.
This message greatly reduced public anxiety, especially as the country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the chances of containing the disease in Wuhan were diminished.
China's disease control agencies can learn from this difficult lesson and make major changes in the future.
For example, institutions should (1) be more careful in providing public information as citizens take note of each word and then change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive to special information provided by hospitals and make appropriate decisions rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorities; (3) take more measures to prevent any emerging epidemic than to try to reassure the public; and (4) regularly organize special events to help the public become more aware of epidemics and to try and improve response strategies in different situations.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it had spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries worldwide at the time of this report.
Since the virus is highly similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar to those of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has been mistaken for a SARS relapse.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in preventing the disease and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people and is more likely to affect men than women, and the age and mortality rates are also higher in older people than in younger people.
SARS was more lethal than COVID-19 (10.91% to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even when they are asymptomatic and SARS patients often spread the virus to others when they are in their final stages, making the containment of COVID-19 more effective than SARS.
This is one of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and over a larger area than SARS-CoV.
A validated RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may not be positive in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be recovering from the virus.
All of these factors significantly increase the risk of viral transmission.
Despite this progress in COVID-19 research, several key questions remain unanswered:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 originate?
Although there is a 96% similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and the two SARS-like CoVs from the bat, it is not possible to confirm that SARS-CoV-2 is from the bat.
What animal first infected the virus from its original animal, say a tick, and transmitted it to humans?
Without the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the spread of the virus, and the epidemic could return at any time.
Although molecular and molecular analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory system and cause subsequent pathogenic mutations?
Does the virus bind to ACE2 receptors in other tissues?
Until we have clear answers to these questions, we cannot rapidly and accurately diagnose this virus and provide adequate treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the nature of the virus change as it spreads among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it become a pandemic like SARS or will it recur like the flu?
Finding answers to these and many other questions is important but can take time.
But, whatever it takes, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normalcy.
Animals have infected humans with coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have allowed coronaviruses (CoVs) to evolve in both human and animal populations over thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human-pathogenic CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild disease, such as influenza.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed the landscape of the HCoV's potential for serious and life-threatening infection.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 caused a resurgence of CoVs in the media due to their highly contagious but less virulence than their SARS-CoV counterparts.
The HCoV is a zoonotic disease and therefore identifying the zoonotic origin of HCoVs would also be helpful.
Most HCoVs are derived from bacteria that are not pathogenic.
The animal hosts of some of the HCoVs are also unknown.
Knowing the animals that live with them has direct implications in preventing human disease.
The study of animal-to-animal interactions with CoVs may also be useful in determining the pathology of CoVs in humans.
In this review, we provide a summary of the current knowledge on the seven HCoVs, focusing on their history of discovery and their animal ancestry and how they spread between different species.
Importantly, we compare different HCoVs by focusing on how the virus mutates and how the genome is rearranged.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is being studied in this framework.
Furthermore, the requirements for viral replication and the effect and the mutations of the virus on the severity of the disease are also outlined.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of RNA viruses that have a host and a receptor.
These viruses contain large genomes with 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses called CoVs because they are corona-shaped in the electron microscope.
In terms of structure, CoVs have a genome that is not segmented in a similar fashion.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome consists of two large, adjacent, and highly conserved sequences (ORF1a and ORF1b), resulting in the proteins pp1a and pp1ab, which have different functions.
The protein is then recycled to form 16 different proteins, known as nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome contains homogeneous protein ORFs, including the head (S), the axon (E), the nucleus (M) and the nucleoprotein (N).
Several related gene proteins are also produced by different CoV families.
Based on the differences in protein structure, CoVs are divided into four subtypes (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delita-CoV), with the beta-CoV subtype containing the most HCoVs and divided into four families (A, B, C and D).
Evidence suggests that fleas and ticks are the source of most aloe-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the most common source of both gama-CoVs and delita-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have been common to many species and some have been identified as potentially virulent viruses that can cause disease in humans.
The human-to-human ratio (HCoV) is currently seven.
The HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are included in the alpha-CoVs.
The five other beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
On the other hand, the newly identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic viruses, causing severe chest respiratory infection in many patients at increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and peripheral pulmonary syndrome.
The first HCoV-229E-derived strain, B814, was identified in nasal fluid from patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, there has been a lot of knowledge from extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause infectious symptoms.
Indeed, it was widely accepted that infection by HCoVs was generally non-infectious until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the worst outbreaks in recent history, affecting 8,000 people and causing an estimated 10% of all deaths.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak became the most common epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula and occasionally spread to other parts of the world.
The novel HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which as of 2 March 2020 had killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000.
It is time for the world to prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
All seven HCoVs are derived from bats, mice or domestic animals.
The HCoVs are a subclass of the highly pathogenic HCoVs, which are not related to the disease, but have a different genetic make-up.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major health, education, social and behavioral challenges in China and globally.
Identifying the animal species from which HCoVs originate provides insight into the natural history, causes and barriers to the translocation of the species.
This could also facilitate or facilitate the detection of the host animal of SARS-CoV-2, the original infector and the source of the outbreak, which could have a significant impact on the prevention of future outbreaks.
In this review, we provide an overview of the animal ancestry of HCoVs, how they spread between different species, and their pathogenicity.
In particular, we propose and examine the commonly held view that viruses that cause HCoVs do not normally cause disease in their animal hosts but do cause disease in humans or newly infected animals after transmission across species.
We also investigate the evolution of HCoVs where high proliferation is often accompanied by reduced pathogenicity.
In this context, we also examine the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs infect animals known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first detection of the HCoV-229E, B814 strain, in nasal mucus from patients with previously unknown influenza, a wide variety of CoVs were identified from various infected animals, including rats, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The historical overview of the discovery of HCoVs (Table 1) has provided information on the human response.
The first HCoV-229E derived strain was identified in the respiratory tract of patients with nasopharyngeal respiratory disease in 1966, and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have experienced the usual flu-like symptoms, including headache, coughing, nausea and sore throat, as well as fever and cough, which occurred in 10~20% of patients.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was detected in tissue and expressed in the brains of infected mice.
The clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 are similar to those of HCoV-229E, and cannot be distinguished from infections caused by other respiratory viruses such as avian influenza viruses and common cold viruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both globally distributed, and are most prevalent in autumn with a mild onset.
In general, the time to develop symptoms for both viruses is less than a week, followed by a period of about 2 weeks.
According to voluntary population studies, people who are not infected with HCoV-229E have a mild case of influenza.
A small number of patients with immunological problems developed severe chest respiratory disease.
SARS, also known as the "extraordinary influenza", was the first HCoV-related outbreak to be extensively studied in human history and was caused by SARS-CoV, the third identified HCoV.
The first SARS case was reported in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
The SARS outbreak has resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths, spreading across multiple countries and continents.
Except for highly contagious cases, it was found that each patient could infect as many as two other people, with symptoms appearing between 4 and 7 days after infection and the virus reaching its peak on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced joint pain, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by shortness of breath, difficulty breathing and severe respiratory distress as later symptoms.
Decreased gene expression, poor serum tests and increased creatinine levels are the main problems SARS presents in the laboratory.
Severe respiratory tract (DAD) damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased immune cell counts are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and resuscitation.
In addition to the chest airways, various organs such as the lungs, liver and kidneys may also be affected in these patients, often leading to increased cytokine levels, which may be fatal, especially in patients with chronic autoimmune disease.
The virus was first identified in a lung swab from a patient who had first been diagnosed with the virus in Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, there have been many advances in HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was detected in a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first seen in young children, adults and in patients with chronic respiratory disease.
Nasal congestion, eye redness, eye infection, and bronchiolitis are the most common causes of HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study identified the virus in a nasal swab from an 8-month-old male with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has appeared in the Netherlands, it is actually found worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to cause about 4.7% of common respiratory tract infections, and is most common in early summer, autumn, and spring.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with a severe infection of the throat and nose.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was detected in a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to the presence of a genetic component in the presence of asthma and bronchial infection, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to increase the risk of developing asthma in patients with severe asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.
All four HCoVs are virulence-dependent and generally do not mutate to become highly infectious viruses, although there have been outbreaks of unknown cause such as the rare and highly virulent HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe chest infections in China.
In general, when these HCoVs have the potential to spread widely and persist in humans, they have little or no pathogenicity.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and pneumonia in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-diagnosed cases are from the Middle East, occasional cases of cross-contamination have been identified in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another mild outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive thrombosis.
In addition to SARS, patients with MERS also developed severe renal impairment, thus making MERS the most common HCoV-related infection to date.
Over 30% of patients develop symptoms of neurological disorders, such as dizziness and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory tests have been performed to confirm the presence of MERS-CoV, with a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most lethal viruses known to date.
From mid-2019 to late December, cases of the previously known strain of SARS-CoV-2 were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern, designating it as COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, a mortality rate of 3.4%.
In this category, the mortality rate in Hubei, China is 4.2% and outside the province is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe flu-like illnesses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are associated with fever, cough and respiratory distress.
Some patients have had diarrhea.
Asthma is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to severe respiratory problems.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a number of nucleotide sequence homologs in the ratio of 82%, they have different sub-branches on the gene tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but has a higher transmission rate compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There have been cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and may therefore be contributing to its rapid global spread.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveals similarities and differences that should be considered.
First, the time to onset and duration of HCoV infection are closely correlated.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between that of SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs that are considered to be endemic (namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits symptoms that are more common during infection with locally adapted HCoVs, such as non-specific, mild, or no symptoms.
Also, a very small number of people with COVID-19 infection may also be present during SARS-CoV infection, although the incidence is somewhat lower.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also indicates a cautious pattern of HCoVs adapting to the environment of SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the HCoVs that infect the species depending on their habitat.
On the other hand, it is still necessary to investigate whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after entering humans as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the urine.
Future studies should determine whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the oral cavity and oral fluids is as significant as that of SARS-CoV at least in some locations.
It is also important to consider in particular whether SARS-CoV-2 can be expressed in a variety of circumstances as HCoVs are expressed in a variety of locations.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its mode of transmission, infectious capacity and long-term human-to-human transmission will play a role in the eventual outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
HCoVs take on a specificity because all four are mildly symptomatic and have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it is also possible that humans may actually have adapted to the four HCoVs.
In other words, both could have survived past HCoV outbreaks.
HCoVs cause severe human disease and people who have severe HCoV-induced disease have died.
To survive, human coronavirus (HCoV) can generate enough subunits to mutate and destroy the antigen that prevents the virus from replicating.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 infection lasts and the more people it infects, the greater the risk of it becoming a human pathogen.
If it is well-established, transmission to a larger population will be difficult to prevent by quarantine or other measures.
Over the years, four strains of the extra-hospital CoV have been transmitted to humans, causing cough in normally immunised individuals.
These viruses do not need to be present in animals.
On the other hand, the major disease-causing viruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to the human body, making human transmission less likely.
They need to maintain their reproductive cycle in animals where the virus is expected to reach people with a weak immune system, via one or more host animals and in which they will be most active.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar structure to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs that are transmitted outside of hospitals.
It is highly contagious in the same way as the HCoVs that are transmitted outside of hospitals, at least so far.
However, it is more infectious than the HCoVs that are not highly infectious such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it will adapt to humans and move safely among humans remains to be seen.
Before discussing the origin of HCoVs, it is worth discussing the definition and characteristics of the species in which HCoVs mutate, coexist, colonize, and are most common.
The animal-associated HCoVs are closely related to the host species and share many common genetic traits.
The animal-borne virus is usually adapted and does not cause the animal disease.
The HCoVs are also known to have a high level of virulence, which is why the HCoVs are often associated with the HCoVs of the host animal.
In both cases, the infected animals are infected in the same way as the HCoV or the host virus.
On the other hand, when HCoVs are new to the host animal shortly before or near the time of infection in humans, they are less well-tracked and are more likely to cause disease.
This host is likely to be the most contagious and susceptible host for the virus, allowing it to multiply rapidly and transmit the virus to humans at a higher rate of human infection.
The HCoV may be non-infectious when it is not mutagenic in the host.
In contrast, HCoVs can adapt to their host and remain there for a long time.
In this case, the host animal becomes a genetically engineered animal.
Epidemic reports suggest that the first case of SARS was transmitted during a game of hunting.
Subsequent blood tests showed that the animal traders had a higher level of immunity against SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Dogs and cats in the animal-food market were first found to carry a SARS-CoV-like virus that is very similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that SARS continued to be reported after killing all the bees in the markets.
However, it has been reported that wild or feral mice that have not been exposed to the laboratory market are free of SARS-CoV, which means that mice may also be susceptible to SARS-CoV but are not able to co-exist naturally.
In particular, while 80% of the various animal species in the markets of Guangzhou have antibodies against SARS-CoV, it is undeniable that many species of small mammals are susceptible to SARS-CoV and are highly susceptible to it.
These all appear to be resistant to SARS-CoV.
Subsequent animal studies of SARS-CoV viruses have shown that the CoV is very similar to the bat CoV, called bat SARS CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the Chinese bat.
The bacteria have antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genome sequence of SARS-Rh-CoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share 88-92% of the SARS-CoV genotype.
This study confirmed the new hypothesis that the insects contain viruses that are not yet mature enough to cause disease in humans.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified in the subshell, but none other than WIV1 is considered pathogenic.
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 was isolated from a sample of a small intestine and used ACE2 in the liver, lungs, and human body.
Surprisingly, the serum of SARS patients was able to deactivate WIV1.
Currently, WIV1 is highly sensitive to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of its specificity with only bats.
Although the two viruses are closely related, it is generally thought that WIV1 is not the parent of SARS-CoV and that the larvae are not the host of SARS-CoV.
The analysis of viral mutations classifies MERS-CoV into the same group as the CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 viruses in the mouse.
Both the HKU-CoV4 and MERS-CoV are receptors for the same DPP4 protein, which is used by the virus to enter the body.
The RNA polymerase-specific protein of MERS-CoV is very similar to its parasite-infected beta-CoV cousins found in Europe and Africa.
To date, no MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and another highly similar virus in the subfamily CoV-HKU25 have only 87% homology in the mouse.
Thus, the mosquitoes may not be the host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels have immune systems that specifically inhibit MERS-CoV, as do camels native to the Middle East from many African countries.
The complete virus of MERS-CoV is similar to the virus found in humans from camel nasal swabs, further indicating that camels are the true host of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that the overall trend is mild but suggests that the virus has matured and evolved from the previously observed high incidence in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
In particular, infected camels have released the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the intestinal tract, which is the primary route of transmission from the ticks.
However, concerns remain that many confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have not been in contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, that it could be a human-to-human transmission or that the source of the infection is unknown and that it is possible that an unknown animal species is infected with MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% molecular weight relationship to the bacterial CoV RaTG13 from the same species.
For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the genetic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are so large that they cannot be considered as a direct co-infection.
The bacteria may not be a host for SARS-CoV-2 unless a similar CoV is found in the bacteria in the future.
The possible host animals for SARS-CoV-2 are wild animals traded at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where many of the first cases of COVID-19 originated, suggesting that the animals may have infected humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that the endangered group of small primates known as the pygmy monkey may also be the source of the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV virus.
The genome of these novel CoVs is composed of 85-92% of the genome of SARS-CoV-2.
However, their affinity for RaTG13 is approximately 90% at the molecular level.
They belong to two subgroups that are genetically similar to SARS-CoV-2, one of which has a receptor-binding protein (RBD) that is 97.4% similar to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of its amino acid structure.
In particular, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although they are highly similar in terms of genome relatedness.
Previous studies of pneumonia also reported the identification of viral isoforms from pulmonary swabs, which are related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used a variety of sequencing and selection methods to determine one genome sequence that accounts for 86.3% of the total viral genome.
In addition, it is possible that the beetle is one of the hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is indirectly related to yellow fever because the structure between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is different from that of yellow fever-receptor beta-CoV.
Also, the interval between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 with beta-CoVs that are more susceptible to yellow fever.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, rodents and other animals needs to be elucidated.
While strong affinity patterns were observed in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and the mosquito, SARS-CoV-2 and related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 shared strong genome-wide affinity patterns.
It is widely believed that the high concentration of intermediate RBD of SARS-CoV-2 virus associated with beta-CoVs that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 is due to selective mutation.
Another project aims to genetically modify SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs that infect the vertebrae and RaTG13 that is recovered from a third wild animal species.
In terms of mutant pathogenesis, gene mutation is most commonly performed in beta-CoVs.
The team is still investigating the animal host of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the most pathogenic HCoVs, the animal derivatives HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Signs of viral mutation suggested that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while viruses that resulted in HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in monkeys.
It has been reported that the APACoV.2 (Appalachian CoV) identified in the North American trilobite has shown close affinity to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another mosquito CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaOct/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while the camel strain was suspected to be the host of the virus.
In particular, the available knowledge on the known animal hosts of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Analysis of viral genomes has provided evidence that there has been historical cross-species transmission of HCoVs.
When HCoV-OC43 originated from a single strain of HCoV that infected humans from domesticated animals around 1890, an outbreak of respiratory illness was observed.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.
The influenza alpha-CoV similar to HCoV-229E has been identified.
Among these is alpha-CoV that infects arupaga.
Considerable evidence supports the possibility of viral transmission from bats to humans.
First, non-Aryan people meet many of the same people in common.
However, humans are the most likely to come into contact with aropaga.
Second, HCoV-229E is not associated with the mosquito alpha-CoV and does not infect mosquitoes, whereas the mosquito alpha-CoV is associated with the respiratory infection in animals.
Finally, arupaga alpha-CoV was detected in the hive.
Thus, it is unlikely that the arpacas were transmitted by HCoV-229E in association with alpha-CoV and humans.
In short, the parasite is responsible for transmitting the human rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Thus, it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
In contrast, where alpha-CoVs are the gene cluster of HCoV-229E, the arthropods and camels may have been the source of the virus and transmitted the virus to humans, similar to the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is a classic example of cross-species transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The mutation of the MERS-CoV in the mosquito genome was known at the time of its initial identification and was confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is clear that the parasites are a major group of zoonotic viruses in gene transfer and animal-to-animal transmission.
The longevity, homogeneity, proximity and high flight capacity are the factors that make the fly a powerful 'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, it has been several years since MERS-CoV first entered camels.
He has successfully adapted these camels from a grazing animal to a safe and natural habitat for the virus.
MERS-CoV causes mild and slowly mutating disease in these animals.
Human transmission is risky and MERS-CoV does not transmit to humans due to its low transmissibility.
The role of the parasite in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different from that of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, and the role of the parasite, if present, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the mosquito beta-CoV is the most pathogenic in mosquitoes.
They may contain SARS-CoV-2 viruses associated with beta-CoV but are not as transmissible as SARS-CoV.
The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animals to humans may or may not be confirmed in future studies.
First, the parasites may be a strain of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses that is only distantly related to SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Humans can share habitat with the primates through mining and coal mining.
Second, the spider monkey may be one of the most prolific viral hosts recently infected with SARS-CoV-2 related viruses.
Humans are infected with the virus through contact with and consumption of wild animals.
It is likely that many mammals including domestic animals are suspected carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies in domestic and wild animals have found that they have anti-viral antibodies.
Third, the proposed genetic mutation and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species of animal exposed to worms and camels.
The search for the pathogen that causes SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to the variety of host species, three aspects of the viral domain are also important in facilitating CoV transmission.
First, it is the highest rate of change in the synthesis of RNA molecules.
Compared to other single-gene RNA viruses, the mutation rate of CoVs in the host or host cell is ~10-4 per year per 2 genes, depending on the stage of adaptation of CoVs in the new host.
CoVs with enzyme-modifying RNA, which degrade its components, undergo extreme mutation and become weak or non-existent.
Interestingly, for the molecular part, Remdesivir is known to inhibit CoV replication via enzyme-gated RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is almost one million times higher than that of the host organisms.
And, mutations are usually higher when CoVs are not well adapted to their hosts.
In comparison to the highly variable SARS-CoV, the mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is at a lower level, which makes it more familiar to humans.
It is said that he had already adapted to another animal that was very close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this includes MERS-CoV, which has been well adapted to camels.
Thus, it is unlikely that a mutation would cause vaccines and antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 to be rapidly weakened.
Second, the large genome RNA in CoVs uses additional genetic mutations and mutations; thus, increasing the probability of mutation in the host, which is an advantage in the development of new CoVs when appropriate.
This is supported by the structure of the protein-derived RNA and its complex function of the 3rd genome.
Third, the CoV is able to mutate and replicate RNA through the process of mutation of the target gene.
In the host animal, genome editing typically occurs when CoV RNA is transferred to the host cell.
Highly similar RNAs and their associated genomes can be genetically modified to produce new CoVs.
The natural mutation of the virus was found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in zoonotic CoVs such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 that are resident in the bat.
The relationship between the virus and the animal in which it is transmitted
In addition to the three viruses mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host is another factor that contributes to the transmission of the virus between different species.
Thus, mutations in SARS-CoV are considered a possible model, and have been shown to selectively target the region of the body through which the virus is transmitted between animals.
Based on comparative analysis between human-infected SARS-COV and mice, it is thought that SARS-CoV is more adaptable to different host strains, specifically the RBD mutation of the S protein.
In general, the RBD of the CoV S-protein binds to the receptor and is selected for resistance by the invading immune system.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located at 318 to 510 amino acid positions on the S1 subunit, making it a binding to human ACE2 and the virus's entry site.
SARS-CoV RBD can detect ACE2 receptors in a variety of animal species, including bats, bats, mice, and rats, allowing the animals to transmit the virus.
In summary, only 6 amino acid residues were tested and found to be different from those of humans and mice with viral RBD and 4 of them have a binding site to the viral ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV in the monkey has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity for the S protein and human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, altering these two amino acids may be critical to allow the virus to adapt to the human body.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 is receptive to the same gene as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 subunit of the S protein indicates that the S protein is related to human ACE2 and may be mutated.
In fact, studies on cryo-EM suggest a 10 - 20 times greater affinity for the binding of human ACE2 to the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It is of interest to confirm whether there is a viral receptor for SARS-CoV-2.
The HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but on a different part of the S protein.
The presence of HCoVs is also a risk factor for the development of HCoV-CoVs, which are not susceptible to infection.
This may explain how CoVs adapt to human exposure to their host animals.
In addition to the viral response, the transmission of HCoVs by the host is also controlled by the host and the anti-viral proteins.
Differences in the viral growth medium between humans and animals that have been harbored by HCoVs such as bats, camels and mice may inhibit transmission of the virus between different species.
HCoVs modify the host's genes and destroy anti-viral proteins to allow them to infect other hosts.
Thus, the molecular components of this complex viral-host relationship need to be further identified and elucidated.
Genome sequencing of the viral growth medium and the SARS-CoV-2 antigen by advanced CRISPR technology may be successful.
The symptoms of the novel HCoV: its origins
Many bat CoV strains offer a high probability of emergence for novel HCoVs.
Thus, the bacterial CoV is the source of the HCoV genes.
The rapid mutation and gene editing that cause HCoV mutations are two important steps in this process.
For example: the detection or loss of a gene that makes a protein has the potential to significantly alter the viral surface.
In SARS-CoV, the ORF8 receptor is thought to be important for adaptive immunity, while isolated SARS-CoV-related virus strains appear to express a different ORF8 receptor.
The 29th variant of SARS-CoV was identified in January at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This gene is a transcription factor that cleaves ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be adaptive to mutations that allow it to be translated to other animals.
And SARS-CoV is known to mutate genes of the alpha and gamma-CoV strains, with a large number of mutated genes being encoded in RNA protein polymerase.
The most commonly occurring transcript is found in nsp9, most in nsp10, and some in nsp14.
In some cases, the MERS-CoV outbreak appears to have been caused by a mutation between two different virus strains in camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mutation activity has also been observed in other HCoVs, with HCoVs mutating the genes of other animal CoVs into their own specific genes.
It should be noted that unnatural selection may contribute to unintended changes in the viral genome, allowing the virus to be isolated from the targeted site, such as the host animal's immune system.
An example of this is the absence of the normal ORF4 gene in HCoV-229E resulting in a double-stranded antibody.
While strong ORF4 was found in the bat and llama viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the arupaga alpha-CoV exhibits single-gene entries, resulting in mutations.
Finally, mutations in new HCoVs are also associated with long-term survival problems in hosts.
No or only mild symptoms have been identified when the bacteria are infected with CoVs, suggesting interactions between CoVs and the bacteria.
The bacteria are clearly genetically adapted to the CoV.
For example, the inactivation of antibodies in mosquitoes effectively reduces the risk of infection by CoV.
And the natural killer cells in mice have been deactivated due to the addition of NKG2/CD94 receptor cells and the low expression of the type I interacting molecule.
And, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from multiple host reactions can inhibit CoV from replicating and have an effect on gene-modifying enzymes, thus selecting for more pathogenic viruses when introduced into new host species.
Other CoV disease genes are mutated, producing new proteins or subunits that allow the animal to adapt to the virus.
Thus, it is not unlikely that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs do not cause disease or mild symptoms in higher animals such as deer and camel.
They are highly modified with no major resistance from the host's immune system.
This is the reason why animals with the virus do not show symptoms and why humans get sick more often.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the increased activity of the immune system and the release of more cytokines, the more resistant the immune system is to the disease, the more lung damage is likely.
This is in contrast to asymptomatic animals, where the immune response to the CoV is altered.
Isolation of the antibodies may be useful in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The anti-viral protein is highly conserved in the larvae.
Thus, the provision of type I antiviral proteins would be beneficial to at least one person infected with SARS-CoV-2.
The NLRP3 anti-viral protein is also inactive in the cells.
Based on these assumptions, inhibition of the NLRP3 protein with MCC950 activity would be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the sequence of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses.
While the beta-CoV from the moth has been found to share 95% of its genome with SARS-CoV, it also shares 96% of its genome with SARS-CoV-2.
While it is known that monkeys and other farm animals have SARS-CoV-like viruses, no SARS-CoV-2 virus has been found to develop in them.
A mosquito beta-CoV has been identified that is highly similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that mosquitoes may be hosts or mosquito beta-CoV is one of the gene-coupled sites of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite some speculation, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally introduced into humans.
CoVs have been recalled due to the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the role of animal hosts in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Strong evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are of mosquito origin and are transmitted to humans through their hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection is caused by human contact with animals in animal markets, closing animal markets and killing animals in the markets would effectively stop the SARS outbreak.
Similarly, leeks should be removed from animal markets to avoid infecting other animals, according to a study of the origin of leeks beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to mammals and other mammals needs to be clarified in the study.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been present in camels.
The camels are important animals for transportation and for providing meat, milk, wool and wool for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, camels should not be sacrificed for the MERS response, as was done in Chinese animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrence of MERS, strong measures must be taken in conjunction with other disease control measures and the development of a vaccine against MERS-CoV.
If we are unable to eradicate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause disease.
Various coviruses infect animals that roam in the wild.
In particular, the CoVs from the fly have a variable potency.
In the near future, it is very likely that the zoonotic CoV will mutate, leading to the emergence of a new strain of CoV that is more transmissible or more lethal.
The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China must be stopped by avoiding unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Due to the ongoing threat of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a clear response plan is needed.
In short, the world has been a place of many viruses for a long time.
They remain in their natural habitat until they have a chance to emerge.
Although ticks have a number of ways to transmit viruses, the risk of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are trained to avoid contact.
Continuous mammal monitoring is important for better understanding the source and host of CoVs, which is important for preventing animal-to-human transmission and preventing future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the only way to prevent zoonotic viruses is for humans to understand the interactions between these viruses and their hosts.
There are still many animal species for which SARS-CoV-2 is not known.
First, if the fleas are infected with the parasite that causes SARS-CoV-2, it is interesting to see why the fleas and the parasites coexist.
Second, if the parasite is directly responsible for the transmission of the virus to humans, the human exposure to the parasite should be documented.
Third, if the third mammal is indeed a host, how it interacts with different species of animals such as humans, insects, and reptiles must be understood.
Finally, since many mammals include domestic animals that may be infected with SARS-CoV-2, tracking and monitoring of infection should be performed.
In the case of the larvae, the larvae of other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its highly pathogenic co-infection virus will be found in the host animal in the near future.
Further animal studies will further clarify the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will play a key role in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Revising the criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis in suspected and confirmed cases is necessary
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid guideline that contains recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (2019-nCoV), and the guidelines provided us with experience and provided better guidance for the global response to the epidemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge of it is gradually increasing based on ongoing research and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously being updated.
In this letter, we have revised one of our guidelines and provided new criteria for the diagnosis of "suspected" and "confirmed" cases according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (seventh edition) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic, now officially called 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic.
In response to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, our team developed an emergency advisory guideline and it was published online in the Military Medical Review on 06 February 2020.
Since its release, it has attracted a lot of attention.
However, it is important to recognize that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge is gradually evolving based on ongoing research and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, published seven editions with some significantly revised sections.
Our guideline then took the idea of Zhou et al. and developed a simple scoring system based on clinical experience.
Their actions add new evidence to our guidelines and provide valuable insights into this global epidemic.
We support their great work and are grateful to them.
However, their work also needs to be updated in light of the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (Phase VII trial) and recent research.
As outlined in the seventh edition (3 March 2020) to confirm a suspected case, one of the following two epidemiological characteristics must be associated with the disease to allow a full analysis, or three if the epidemiological history is unclear:
Epidemic-related information: (1) Travel to, or residence in, Wuhan and surrounding areas, or elsewhere where a COVID-19 case was reported in the past 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) Contact with an infected SARS-CoV-2 case (with a nucleic acid test); (3) Contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas, or elsewhere where COVID-19 cases were reported in the past 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (4) Contact with a local patient (more than 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms in the past 2 weeks in a confined space, home, office, school, etc.)
Symptoms of the disease: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) and signs of COVID-19 infection; (3) overall white blood cell count indicating normal, no increase or decrease in the baseline.
A confirmed case should be based on a suspicion of disease with one of the following symptomatic or blood-based outcomes: (1) A real-time PCR test that detects SARS-CoV-2 infection; (2) a viral genome sequence that shows a similarity to a known novel coronavirus; (3) a positive expression of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG proteins in serum testing; or a mutation of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG proteins in both healthy and infected individuals, or a 4-fold increase in the same site over the course of a severe infection.
We note that the levels of respiratory nucleic acid or blood samples were taken when added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) volumes.
Diagnosis by blood sample was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020); and blood-based signals were added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing efforts of researchers to better identify the presence of nucleic acid for rapid testing, and respiratory tract samples including blood samples, which allows for more diverse samples, and support the identification of specific antibodies against established criteria.
In addition, there are numerous signs to be aware of for both non-symptomatic and symptomatic cases.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. scorecard should be revised, as they classified as "low risk" a person without symptoms.
The quality of the scores should also be checked in other clinical and research applications.
Finally, we hope that more indirect evidence will emerge and invite readers to contribute their thoughts.
With regard to the screening of "suspected" and "confirmed" cases, we ask that you follow and comply with the latest national guidelines.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest number in a single day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Centre for Disease Control, Research and Prevention (IEDCR) reported that the number of cases included 114 active cases and 33 recoveries at home.
The total number of deaths is 17.
In an online statement, IEDCR Director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two of the deceased were over 60 years of age, two were between 51 and 60 years of age, and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local newspaper, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the Chairman of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
In a video announcement on Sunday, Bangladesh's Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport was suspended for longer than originally planned until Saturday.
The travel ban was scheduled to begin on March 26 and end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of basic goods including medicine, firewood and food was still allowed.
The first COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh were identified on 8 March, in two people who had returned from Italy and one of them was a woman.
By March 9, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has already infected more than one million people worldwide
As of Thursday, the total number of confirmed cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 people died from COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The number was announced on the same day that Malawi announced its first case of coronavirus and Zambia's first death from the virus.
On Thursday, North Korea declared itself one of the few remaining coronavirus-free countries.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, of which 79,332 were reported in the 24 hours before 10:00 CET (08:00 GMT) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, of which 5,900 have died.
Citing data from Johns Hopkins University, CBS News reported that 1,000 people died from the coronavirus in the United States on Wednesday.
Globally, countries have announced strong measures to contain the spread of the epidemic.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the curfew to May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would continue to receive paid sick leave until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament extended the state of emergency for 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 against and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to a full day; previously it was from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to introduce a curfew between 22:00 and 04:00.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that his state had extended the state's curfew to May 1.
Australian shops set a limit on the amount of toilet paper that can be bought
On Saturday night, Woolworths and Coles in Australia reduced the number of toilet paper to two and reduced the number of toilet paper to one pack in all of their stores nationwide.
On Monday, ALDI also announced that the maximum number of packages per person should be limited to one.
The limits were announced as a message on the payment platform and on the Facebook pages of the stores.
It was reported that customers were buying the toilet paper in bulk due to the threat of COVID-19 when quarantine was required.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also reduced the amount of toilet paper it sends to its home delivery products to one pack per order.
The change followed the four-pack ban that was imposed by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March.
In a March press release, Coles announced that following the standard policy of no more than one four-pack of paper, "many stores are running out of goods after one hour of processing", and announced that the purchase "has never happened", while ALDI on Tuesday announced on Facebook that it was "unanticipated".
Sales have "surged" in the past week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco in Canberra also reduced the toilet paper limit to two packets last week.
To further reduce the shortage of toilet paper, Coles ordered larger packages from its distributors, increasing the frequency of delivery, and Woolworths ordered more toilet paper, while ALDI brought in stock for Wednesday's promotional sale earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, said retailers could increase sales, but the trucking regulations imposed by the local government made it difficult.
He believes that prices will rise, as retailers try to meet customer demand, and offer them a limited promotion.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to early stock-out, some stores may not be able to offer Wednesday promotions.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a business expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores were stocking up at night.
He also noted that paper towels are a commodity that is packaged, which makes them scarce in the store, and when they are sold out, they leave a lot of space on the shelves, which makes people feel that the product is lost.
Russell Zimmerman of ABC News: "Coles and Woolworths believe that having more products on their shelves, such as toilet paper and pesticides, would reduce public fears".
Who Gives a Crap, which recycles used toilet paper, said it had sold out of its warehouse last Wednesday.
News.com.au reports that Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex cleaning products, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent cleaning products, have insisted that they will be open 24/7 to supply.
Domain.com, a real estate website, announced that real estate agents were offering free vouchers to first-time home buyers at the Melbourne auction, which was a limited auction because buyers had a Labor Day holiday that coincided with the weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, Darwin's paper daily, added eight pages that can be cut and used as a clean sheet.
Stores did not want to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 ABC Australia report, which said they had no plans to impose restrictions on consumer purchases.
Other products that were also heavily marketed included masks, insecticides, dry foods, hand soap and nephrins, Zimmerman said.
It was similar outside Australia, where on Sunday night the UK online retailer Ocado reduced Andres's paper to no more than two packs of 12.
The WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 to be a pandemic.
While the term "pandemic" refers to the extent to which the disease has spread to many countries, not specifically to its severity, the WHO has highlighted the importance of government involvement in the response:
"All countries can change the direction of the pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General: "Countries should identify, test, treat, isolate, host contacts and promote appropriate precautions", he said.
"We are deeply concerned by the rapid spread and spread of the epidemic and the lack of action to control it.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former CEO of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the epidemic "has never happened".
In his statement released by CNN in February, he said: "Except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has surpassed its own exposure and become a global pandemic".
Ghebreyesus also echoed this sentiment, saying, "We have not seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus".
He continues, "And we have never seen a disease that can be effectively controlled".
The emergence of the pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director General, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said: "It is clear that the pandemic is making things worse".
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that at least 126,000 people have been infected with COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 of them dying.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is the current outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
In December 2019, the outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China; it was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million people had been infected with COVID-19 in 210 countries and territories, of which nearly 97,000 had died.
Nearly 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is about 4% in China, while the global rate is between 13.04% in Algeria and 0.8% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Severe symptoms include pneumonia and severe respiratory distress.
The onset of symptoms is usually around five days, but can range from two days to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or treatment for the virus.
Primary care is to treat symptoms and help the patient to avoid illness. Preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining social distancing, and monitoring and self-isolation of suspected infected individuals.
World leaders have responded to the pandemic by halting travel, imposing quarantines, restrictions, containment of workplaces and closing establishments.
The pandemic has caused a significant disruption of economic and social activities, including the postponement or suspension of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and has led to a global shortage of goods caused by wholesale purchasers due to the threat of pandemic.
Schools and universities have been closed either nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's students.
Rumours of the virus have also spread online, with some reports of violence or discrimination against foreigners, especially Chinese, East and Southeast Asian immigrants, and others from areas where the virus is endemic.
Due to the decrease in traffic and the closure of major industries, air pollution and air pollution have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the Health Department in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and in early January 2020 the investigation began.
The cases are linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the virus is suspected to have originated from animals.
The virus caused a new disease known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is similar to the coronavirus found in flies, ticks, and SARS-CoV. The first known case of a person with symptoms was reported on 1 December 2019, and the person had no known contact with the animal market.
Other cases were first reported in December 2019, with two-thirds of them being related to the source.
On 3 March 2020, unconfirmed reports published by the South China Morning Post stated that the first case was confirmed on 17 November 2019, with a 55-year-old man in Hubei Province as the probable first case. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that new cases had decreased in China but were rising sharply in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be many unreported cases; in particular, those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, the lowest number of infections has been reported among young people, with those under 19 accounting for 2.4% of global infections.The UK government's scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the UK population could be infected before a vaccine is available.
Cases are the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19, and whose tests have been validated according to government protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, and several countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have set guidelines not to test those with mild symptoms.
A study published on 16 March showed that as of 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 cases in China had not been detected, with unreported cases accounting for 79% of reported cases.
Statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases in Italy exceeded the reported number.
The rate of new infections (R0) of COVID-19 would range from 1.4 to 2.4.
The study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure could be as high as 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
In the case of non-recovery, the time from the onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, but the most common is 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 people have died from COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, 80% of those who died were over 60 years of age, and 75% had other underlying health conditions including heart disease and diabetes.The official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic was mainly based on COVID-tested individuals according to government protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be higher than the reported figure, as it does not include untested deaths, e.g.: deaths at home, in nursing homes and elsewhere.
Some sources in Italy have suggested that the number of deaths during the current pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official death toll from COVID.
A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said: "We know that the reported death toll is not consistent with the actual death toll, which is consistent with previously reported data that the US has not counted all deaths from the virus.This counting of all deaths often occurs during epidemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.The first confirmed case of the virus was reported on 9 January 2020".
On 1 February, the first death outside of China occurred in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, outside of China, more than a dozen people had died in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are being used in various places to count the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the samples collected, the functioning of the healthcare system, the vaccination, the duration of the outbreak, and demographic factors such as age, sex, and overall health status.The mortality rate is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases over a period of time.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the overall mortality rate for the newly infected was 6.0% (97,039/1,617 204) as of 10 April 2020.
The numbers vary by region.
In China, the mortality rate for infections decreased from 17.3% (for those who were symptomatic on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who were symptomatic after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the proportion of people who died from the disease, and the infection rate (IFR), which indicates the proportion of infected people (whether or not tested) who died from the disease.
These estimates are not error-based and track specific individuals from infection to recovery or death.
Several universities have attempted to compute this number for specific populations.
The Oxford University Evidence-Based Medicine Center estimates the overall prevalence of the disease to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The high numbers for this group are in line with the results of the first COVID-19 randomized controlled trial in Germany and the study's mortality rate based on the test subjects.
WHO says the epidemic is preventable.
The duration of the outbreak and the extent of the spread are not known and may vary from region to region.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said:  Without control, pathogenic diseases often persist to some extent and begin to decline when the pathogenic organisms are no longer present.
But it is difficult to predict the future now.
The Chinese government's chief medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, stated that the epidemic could have ended by June "when all countries complied with the WHO guidelines to stop the spread of the disease".
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine reported that SARS-CoV-2  will move from one location to another, possibly for a year or two.
According to a study by Imperial College University's Neil Ferguson, population-based vaccination and other measures should be maintained "until a vaccine is available (within 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, because it's so highly contagious, will be completely gone and could become a seasonal disease, and then come back every year".
The recurrence of this highly contagious virus will be driven by the immune system and the mutations of the virus.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may not be specific and infected individuals may not show symptoms.
The most common symptoms were fever (88%) and whooping cough (68%).
Rare symptoms include fatigue, coughing, shortness of breath, shortness of breath, sore throat, sore throat, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, coughing up blood, sweating or blue skin. WHO reports that approximately one in six people will be infected with the virus and develop respiratory problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists symptoms of the condition as including respiratory problems, chest pain or itching, sudden fainting, difficulty in getting up, burning eyes or lips, and it is recommended that people with these symptoms seek medical attention immediately if they are not cured. Progressive symptoms may include shortness of breath, severe respiratory problems, vomiting, acid reflux, and death.
When some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, when they do not show symptoms but test results show a positive infection, the researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with confirmed infected individuals should be monitored and tested for infection.
China reports a baseline asymptomatic rate of as low as 44%.
The typical time to symptom onset (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is from one to 14 days; it is usually a few days.A more controversial example is the decline in the number of COVID-19 patients who lose their sense of smell from 30% to 15%.
Some of the details of the disease's transmission are still unclear.
It is thought that the disease is mainly transmitted by close contact with saliva that is produced when a person coughs, sneezes, or is in close contact with another person within 1 to 2 meters.
Studies have shown that a sudden cough can cause the fluid to travel between 4.5 and 8.2 meters.
Others suggest that the virus may be transmitted through persistent airborne fluids, which may be released when a person speaks. Respiratory fluids may also be released when a person breathes in during speech, which is primarily airborne.
These fluids may fall into the mouth or nose of people who are very close or inhaled and then into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as pulmonary resuscitation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause these respiratory fluids to enter the airways and spread the disease through the air.
It can be spread by contact with a contaminated area such as the skin and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it could be transmitted through fecal matter, this risk is considered to be very low.
The Chinese government has denied that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the saliva of an infected person and that the bacteria travel through the mouth of an infected person.The virus is most commonly transmitted during the first three days after symptoms appear, although it can spread before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
People who are diagnosed within three days of developing symptoms are more likely to transmit the disease before showing symptoms.
There are few reports of asymptomatic cases that are not only laboratory confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has also been detected in some countries during contact tracing testing.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) reports that it is unclear how easily the disease can be transmitted, with one infected person transmitting it to two or three others.Virus can persist for hours or days in certain areas.
In particular, the virus can survive for up to three days on a plastic (poropropylene) surface, 304 days on stainless steel, one day on cardboard and up to four days on copper.
However, the process varies depending on the temperature and humidity.Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK regulators recommend that people wash their hands after contacting animals and after touching potentially infected people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, isolated from three people who had influenza-like illness in Wuhan.
All of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus strains are identical to the coronavirus. When not present in the human body, the virus is killed by a household soap that disperses the virus and covers it. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the virus from which SARS-CoV originated.
It is thought to be of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus belongs to the same family as Betakoronavirus, which belongs to the family of Sariaboviruses (family B) both of which are derived from mosquitoes.
It is 96% identical to the genome of other strains of the bacterial coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found only one amino acid difference in the genome structure between a virus isolated from bats and a virus isolated from humans.
To date, all genome sequencing has revealed up to 92% of the genome composition of the mosquito coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to confirm that mosquitoes were the original source of infection.
Viral infection may be tentatively diagnosed based on symptoms, pending final confirmation by rapid rRT-PCR of infected cells or CT scans.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT is more accurate at detecting viral patterns than PCR, although it is not well defined, some of the features of this laboratory approach are similar to other tests for pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Diagnostic Radiology states:  CT scans should not be used for diagnosis or used as the primary diagnostic method for COVID-19.
WHO has published several protocols for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with the first one published on 17 January.
The test uses a real-time rRT-PCR technique.
The test may be performed on samples taken from the respiratory tract or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
The test is usually performed using a nasal swab, although a nasal swab may also be used.Many laboratories and companies are developing a blood test that can detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these methods has proven to provide accurate measurement for widespread use.
In the United States, the Cellex blood test is approved as a standard of care but is only available to licensed laboratories.
CT and MRI scans are used to screen people for symptoms including GGO and pulmonary fluid.
The Italian Association for Transmission Medicine is developing an international database of transcriptal test results from confirmed cases.
Due to the similarity to other infectious agents such as adenovirus, PCR-validated swabs cannot be reliably identified for COVID-19.
A large Chinese study compared the results of CT and PCR chest scans and found that while the MRI was not as accurate as the virus, it was faster and more accurate, and was considered a diagnostic tool for the epidemic.
The CNN method is based on the artificial intelligence developed to detect the viral patterns using a scan and CT scans.
Measures to prevent the spread of infection generally include good personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching the face, nose or mouth without washing hands, and coughing or sneezing with a hand towel and discarding the hand towel immediately.
Those who have been infected are advised to wear a face mask when in public.
Social distancing measures are important to prevent the spread.Many governments have banned or advised against non-essential travel to or from countries and areas where the outbreak is present.
However, in many parts of the world, the virus has become a citizen-to-citizen transmission.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community, and some members of the community do not know where or how they became infected. Health care providers who are treating a potentially infected person are advised to follow standard precautions, avoid contact, and wear face protection. Tracing contacts is an important tool for health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent further spread.
The government's use of mobile phone location data has raised privacy concerns with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing statements calling for an end to the surveillance.
Various applications were developed or proposed for voluntary use, and on 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert teams sought a privacy-friendly solution such as using Bluetooth technology to store data from mobile phones in transit.
Users of these phones receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Misinformation is being spread about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal sprays and oral hygiene products do not kill the virus.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, but several companies are developing one.
Hand washing is important to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds; especially after using the toilet or with obviously contaminated hands, before eating, and after coughing, sneezing, or coughing.
This is because when the virus is not in the body, it is killed by household soap, which has the ability to destroy the virus's covering.
The CDC also recommends the use of hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
The WHO advises people to avoid touching their face, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
The pathogens on the surface of the microorganism are most likely to be killed by the use of chemicals (within one minute of contact with a stainless steel disinfectant), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.27.5% povidone iodine.
Some drugs, such as benzariconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are not effective in killing insects.
The CDC requires that if there is a suspected or confirmed COVID infection in an office or daycare, all office, bathroom, public, and shared electronic devices such as tablets, charging cabinets, laptop, remote controls, and ATMs used by patients must be disinfected.
Health authorities require that people cover their mouth and nose with their elbow pads or a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and to remove the handkerchief from the affected area.
Medical masks are the best option for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask restricts the amount and range of fluid that is released when you speak, cough, or sneeze.
WHO has published guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask reduces the frequency of facial contact, which is a common source of infection when the hands are not properly cleaned".Masks are also used to care for a person who may be ill.
WHO recommends that healthy individuals only wear masks when they are at high risk of infection, such as when caring for someone with COVID-19, and also recommends that masks are worn to avoid contact with the face.
Many countries have begun to encourage their citizens to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical face masks for people who are not ill.In particular, China recommends the use of disposable medical face masks for healthy people, especially if they are within 1 meter of others.
Hong Kong requires people to wear medical masks when traveling or in public places.
Health authorities in Thailand are encouraging people to work at home and wash cloth masks daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out without a mask or face and mouth cover.
On 16 March, Vietnam required everyone to wear a mask in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Australian government has mandated that anyone entering a grocery store must wear a face mask.
Israel has required all citizens to wear face masks in public.
April 1: Taiwan, which produces more than 10 million masks a day, requires passengers on intercity trains and buses to wear masks.
Panama has mandated the wearing of masks whenever outdoors, and requires homemade masks for those who cannot afford to buy factory-made ones.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as social distancing) includes measures to prevent transmission to reduce the spread of the virus and social distancing.
These include quarantines, travel bans, and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shops.
Individuals can implement social distancing measures by staying home, reducing travel, avoiding crowded public places, using non-contact greetings, and maintaining social distance.
Currently, many countries are recommending or requiring social distancing for people in affected areas.
The limit of the number of people required by US government agencies and health authorities to gather together was quickly reduced from 250 (when no COVID-19 cases were known in the area) to 50 and then further reduced to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned social gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and a weakened immune system are at risk for developing disease and health problems, and are advised by the CDC to stay indoors as much as possible if they are at risk of being infected by peers. In late March 2020, the WHO and other health agencies began to restrict the use of the term "social distancing" to "personal distancing", to clarify the need to avoid physical contact while maintaining clear social distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to the idea that people should be isolated rather than encouraged to maintain social contact through other means.Some agencies have issued guidelines for sexual health during the pandemic.
The guidelines state that you should only have sex with a partner who is free of the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Home isolation is important for people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and are suspected to be infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed guidelines on the best way to self-quarantine.Many countries have mandated or required self-quarantine for all people living in infected areas.
Strict self-isolation instructions were issued to those in high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to countries or regions with high prevalence are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the last day they may have been exposed to the infection.
Control measures are measures to contain or stop an infection and slow its spread.
Prevention is carried out at the beginning of an outbreak and aims to monitor and quarantine the infected as well as introduce additional control measures and seek vaccination to prevent further spread of the disease to other populations.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of an epidemic, efforts are directed towards mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and to reduce the impact of the epidemic on healthcare and society.
Prevention and containment measures can be implemented simultaneously.
To contain an epidemic requires strong measures to contain the epidemic by reducing the number of new infections to less than 1.One part of the response to an infectious disease epidemic is to try to contain the rapid increase in infections known as the new infection rate.
It reduces the burden of overloading health services with the number of patients and provides enough time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmacological infection control measures include the management of the epidemic through personal prevention measures such as hand sanitization, mask wearing, and self-quarantine; community-based measures such as school closures and public activities; public awareness and response; and environmental measures such as heavy sweeping. Other strong measures have been taken to contain the outbreak in China when it becomes evident, such as the quarantining of entire cities and strict travel restrictions.
Other countries have also implemented a variety of measures to curb the spread of the virus.
South Korea has started mass testing and quarantining and announcing travel for those infected.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who self-quarantined and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has penalized those who steal medical supplies.The UK and US have also shown that containment (reducing the number of cases rather than stopping the spread of the disease) and containment (reducing the number of new cases) have been challenging.
Measures to reduce infection rates may reduce the number of patients requiring medical care by two thirds and the number of deaths by half, but they do not prevent thousands of deaths and the continuing high number of patients in the health care system.
Epidemic containment is the best option, but should be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in humans (or until a vaccine is available, depending on what has happened previously), and infections are not contagious, otherwise the virus may return if these measures are relaxed.
Long-term efforts to contain the epidemic pose social and economic risks.
There are no specific drugs approved to reduce the severity of COVID-19, but development is ongoing, including the evaluation of conventional antiviral drugs.
Taking over-the-counter flu medication, drinking plenty of water, and resting can help reduce symptoms.
Due to the severity of the disease, oxygen therapy, hydrotherapy, and respiratory support are required.
Steroid use can increase the risk of developing heart disease.
Several drugs that have been approved for other viral diseases are being studied for use in COVID-19.
WHO reported that: Traditional and home remedies may reduce the severity of symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and efficiency considerations for healthcare institutions to treat COVID-19 patients are defined by WHO as the primary measures in the response to the pandemic.
ECDC and the WHO's European regional office issued guidance for hospitals and primary healthcare providers to shift from the use of laboratory services to other services, such as focusing on COVID-19 testing, discontinuing unnecessary medical procedures, isolating and quarantining COVID-19 patients, and increasing the capacity of emergency services by training physicians and increasing the number of ventilators for patients and beds.
There are conflicting reports as to where the initial infection (first detection of the virus) originated.
The first known case of the new coronavirus was on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been increasing.
The infected were primarily associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live animals, and other sources suggest that the virus came from some of these animals; in other words, it was animal-derived. Patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were diagnosed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian of Hubei Provincial Hospital, reported to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On 30 December, a medical team at Wuhan Central Hospital informed colleagues of the existence of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were charged by the police for spreading rumours, and another, Ai Fen, was charged by his superiors for disclosing the matter.
The Wuhan Health Commission subsequently issued a public statement on 31 December and informed WHO.
Health authorities were informed of a large number of cases of an unknown strain of the virus in Wuhan, prompting the launch of a screening test in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, aided by the Chinese New Year travel and the fact that Wuhan is the hub and the main hub for interprovincial rail services.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The latest government data showed 6,174 cases on 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy as the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; over 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.
Nearly 200 countries and territories had at least one confirmed case.
In response to the pandemic in Europe, Schengen countries have restricted travel and implemented border controls.
Countries have implemented pandemic response measures such as quarantines (known as home quarantine) and others.As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people or nearly 90% of the population were under a similar lockdown in the United States, while more than 50 million people in the Philippines, nearly 59 million people in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India were under a lockdown.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in a home-based gum-like system, which grew to 2.6 billion two days later, almost one-third of the global population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was first reported on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; unconfirmed reports of the first case on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian followed up with people with pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26, his hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Preliminary genetic testing conducted on patients on 27 December 2019 showed that SARS was a coronavirus-like virus.
A public statement was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
In the reporting of the incident, Wuhan doctors were warned by the police for "spreading rumours" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially declared that there was no "evidence of human-to-human transmission".
In late January, the Chinese government announced the launch of a major campaign, which was later described by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping, as "the people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest mass lockdown in human history", the travel restrictions announced on 23 January suspend travel to and from Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting nearly 57 million people.

Some Chinese officials, including Zhao Lijian, have denied the early recognition of the coronavirus' origins in Wuhan, supporting the misguided theories that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has dubbed the coronavirus the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus" in a claim that China has suppressed data that would have made the virus more powerful and could have become a global pandemic, but this has been widely criticized by some as discriminatory and to distract attention from the administration's weakness in containing the outbreak.

The source accused Russia of trying to create a "political and diplomatic crisis" between the countries.
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and appeared to be praising Russia.

Chinese and Italian measures to combat over-consumption and illicit trade have been successful, preventing the expected food shortages in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, which is traditionally a major agricultural producer, has not seen a significant drop, but industry representatives warn of rising prices.
Food stores were empty for a short time, and even in Wuhan, Chinese authorities opened a pig feed warehouse to ensure that the population had enough food.
Similar laws in place in Italy require food manufacturers to keep their stocks in case of emergencies.

In January and February 2020, at the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, an estimated 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the 300 million rural Chinese workers are confined to their homes in the central provinces or in Hubei Province.As of March 2020, over 10 million Americans have lost their jobs and are seeking government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus pandemic could result in 47 million job losses in the United States and the unemployment rate could be as high as 32%.In India, the lockdown has left millions of Indian immigrants without jobs.A study by Angus Reid found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced unemployment.Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the lockdown began in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for access to the general credit scheme. About half a million businesses in Germany sent their employees to temporary state-sponsored schemes known as Kurzarbeit'.
The German short-term benefit scheme has been adopted by France and the United Kingdom.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic, as it has affected the functioning of institutions and individuals (both employer-owned and self-employed) globally.
Cultural and arts organizations have tried to address their (often publicly funded) responsibilities to preserve cultural heritage, to provide for the safety of staff and the public, and to assist artists wherever possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, galleries, and other cultural institutions were permanently closed and their exhibitions, events, and performances were either cancelled or postponed.
In response, measures were taken to expand digital services. Another recent major decision that is accelerating the pandemic's slowdown is the cancellation of all concerts, major sporting events, and other mass events including concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry has also been affected, and the Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which takes place during the last week of the Christian Penitential Season in October, has been cancelled.
Many dioceses have asked adult parishioners to stay home from church on Sundays; some congregations have held meetings via radio, Internet, or television while others have arranged to follow the meetings from their cars.
While the Catholic Church has closed dioceses and chapels and closed the St. Peter's Basilica to pilgrims, other faiths have suspended meetings and reduced the number of people meeting in churches, mosques, synagogues, and other places.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the suspension of Friday prayers in the affected areas and the closure of shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most severe disruption to the global sporting calendar since the end of World War II.
Many sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Club World Cup, the 2019-20 English Championship, the 2020 European Cup, the 2019-20 U.S. Handball Championship, and the 2019-20 NHL.
The pandemic also disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the Games would be "postponed beyond 2020 to no later than summer 2021".
This has led to a shift of gambling to the Internet, with many gambling sites reporting a significant increase in registrations. Entertainment has also been affected, with many bands cancelling or postponing their concert tours.
Major theaters such as Broadway have suspended all performances.
Some artists have sought to continue to produce and share their work online as an alternative to traditional live performances, live concerts, or web-based "events" that host artists and promote and promote their work.
Internet comics focusing on the coronavirus have become popular as many people have wanted to be entertained and entertained while not knowing where things are going.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, there has been a high incidence of prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as people from high-incidence areas in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
High levels of fear, prejudice, and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (when most cases were still in China) showed a racial sentiment emerging in various groups around the world, saying that the Chinese either deserved the virus or would have to face the punishment that was their due.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported that they had been discriminated against on the basis of their geographical origin.
There has been support for the Chinese, both physically and online, and in the areas affected by the virus.
With the spread of the disease to new countries, citizens in Italy, the country with the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Europe, may be more sensitive to the problem of alienation and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed a letter urging other countries to ban Chinese nationals from entering their countries in an effort to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been trending on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asian communities in the UK and the US reported increasing discriminatory harassment and attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for calling the coronavirus the "Chinese Virus", a term that critics consider to be racist and anti-Chinese.
Ukrainian protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian evacuees and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the northeast of India, which shares a border with China, and study in major Indian cities have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
The president of the West Bengal branch of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed the environment "and that is why God punished them".
This was immediately condemned by the Chinese embassy in Kolkata, which declared it to be "inappropriate".In China xenophobia and racism were exacerbated by the epidemic, with foreigners being called "foreign trash" and should be thrown away.
Many news sites with online subscription fees have removed some or all of their coronavirus-related news charges.
Scientific authors have published scientific papers on the epidemic and are available for anyone to access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their recent research findings with others on open source software servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses includes viral detection and detection of immune response.
The viral content of the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA.
It is used to confirm newly infected or recovered cases.
Antibody identification (blood test) may be used both for testing and for population control.
Immunological tests reveal the number of people who have the disease, including those with symptoms too mild to report to authorities or those who are asymptomatic.
The exact number of deaths from the epidemic and the level of immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to the low number of people tested, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was such a wide variation that testing was not done in all countries.
This mutation can also have a significant impact on mortality rates, which may be highly unpredictable in some countries.
With rapidly collecting and analyzing viral samples (rRT-PCR), diagnosis of the disease can be made from samples of respiratory fluids obtained by a variety of methods, including saliva samples or throat swabs.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR with a nasal swab is the only reliable method during the first week of infection.
The virus can then be absorbed through the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
For those who are found to be positive in the second week, it is recommended that a second round of multiple sclerosis tests be performed.
One of the latest PCR tests was tested at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using rapid rRT-PCR and 250,000 sets of samples donated by the World Health Organization.
The United Kingdom also scheduled a test by 23 January 2020.On 28 January 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical test kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the "E" genome of the human coronavirus, and the RdRp genome of SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to be approved by the National Institute of Medical Devices to use PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kits.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is deploying RT-PCR diagnostic kits for the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) in laboratories that have been tested by the International Reagent Resource Center.
One of three tests for the cell structure in an older version of the test suite has yielded unreliable results due to substandard drugs used, and testing limitations at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta; this has resulted in an average of 100 tests per day being accurately screened throughout February 2020.
The two-part test was not scheduled to be approved until February 28, 2020, and until then state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration with an emergency approval.Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that a nationwide RT-PCR-based COVID-19 assay had been developed.
Quest Diagnostics also developed nationwide COVID-19 tests available as of March 9, 2020.
No maximum number has been determined; collection and processing of samples must be done according to the requirements of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and is being administered by the State Institute of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the National Institute of Health (NIMH) began testing for the virus.On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a device that could test for COVID-19.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA to develop a test that would provide results in 3.5 hours at the most, resulting in a single machine that could test 4,128 people in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to test Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received emergency use authorization from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA approved a test that uses a thermal imaging technology on nucleic acid instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a heat transfer sequence, the method can provide positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbot plans to increase capacity to 50,000 tests per day. A test using antibodies that bind to the N-type coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, and it is hoped that it will provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to the rapid flu test.
In March 2020, research papers concluded that "in the early stages, chest X-rays are not very useful for diagnosis, and computed tomography scans may be available even before the onset of symptoms".
The characteristic features of a CT scan include a full-angle view of the lungs, with a clear view of the sides, center, and back.
The subpulmonary acute, acute emphysema of certain parts of the lungs increases with the severity of the disease.
A study comparing the PCR and CT scans in Wuhan to look for the source of the outbreak found that the evidence suggested that the outbreak was more severe in Wuhan, where it was associated with other respiratory diseases.
As of March 2020, the US National Academy of Radiology has recommended that "the Wuhan method should no longer be used to test for COVID-19".As of March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) requires PCR as the primary method of screening.
One of the body's most effective ways of fighting infections is to activate antibodies including IgM and IgG.
This can help detect infection in humans as early as day 7 or after the onset of the first symptoms, by monitoring the level of immunity and conducting community testing. Analysis of samples can be performed in a standard laboratory (CLT) or other PoCT (point of contact) setting.
The mass-testing assays in most clinical laboratories will be used for the analysis, but the availability of results will depend on the speed of the process.
In conventional laboratories, a single sample of blood is typically used, although successive samples may be used to monitor immunity.
At the other site of the test, the only blood sample normally seen was a skin puncture.
Unlike PCR, the pre-expression method is not required prior to testing.On 26 March 2020, the FDA announced 29 agencies that had declared as required and could now provide the results of their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA for emergency use.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostic received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The ability to test for infection can reach hundreds of test points in a matter of hours and is much faster than the PCR test commonly used to test for viral RNA.
Antibodies typically appear within 14 days after infection has started. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody kits it had purchased could be used effectively.
Congo introduced a system whereby anyone suspected of being infected could stay at home, be given a "special kit" by the emergency department, be cut up, and then be returned for a diagnosis. The UK's National Health Service (NHS) announced plans to introduce home testing for suspected infections, which would reduce the risk of a patient becoming infected when visiting a hospital, or requiring a disinfectant injection in the car of a patient. In the process of collecting a COVID-19 test, a Hong Kong doctor would do it professionally and follow all guidelines.
Vehicle-based testing facilities have enabled South Korea to conduct some of the fastest and most extensive testing of any country.In Germany, on 2 March, the Medical Health Insurance Association reported that it has a capacity to test approximately 12,000 people per day using emergency equipment and that 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The cost is covered by health insurance if the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the overall capacity to test 160,000 people per week.
As of 19 March, testing has been conducted in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive cases were reported.
An initial lab study reported that at least 483,295 people had been tested for the week of 12/2020, including the week of 12/2020, of whom 33,491 (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a system to test 64 patients at once, with a sample taken and retested if a positive test was found.In Wuhan, a 2,000 m2 laboratory for the treatment of blindness called "Huo-Yan" 火眼 in Chinese, or "The Eye of Fire" in Chinese, was officially opened on 5 January 2020 by the BGI, and more than 10 000 people could be tested.
The construction was overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and lasted for 5 days, the sampling showed that the incidence in Hubei would have increased by 47% and the cost of dealing with quarantines would have doubled if the current testing capacity had not been available.
The Wuhan laboratory was soon followed by the Huo-Yanmu laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in all 12 cities in China.
As of 4 March 2020, a total of 50,000 tests were performed daily. A rapid and accessible approach developed by Origami Assays can test 1,122 COVID-19 patients using only 93 tests. This experimental approach can be performed in a small laboratory without the need for robotic particle processing.
As of March, the scarcity and lack of available laboratory vaccines represented a significant barrier to large-scale testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
This has led some authors to write about the testing protocol which requires heating to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to produce tissue that allows retesting.On 31 March, it was reported that the United Arab Emirates had the highest capacity to test its population of any country, with the country having a test program for almost all of its population.
This was due to the integration of vehicle-based testing and the purchase of Group 42 and BGI (based on the rapid-testing Huo-Yan) multi-person test labs.
Built in 14 days, the lab can process more than ten thousand RT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first of its kind to operate outside of China.
Various testing methods for different components of the coronavirus genome have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has endorsed the German contribution to the production of equipment for developing countries that cannot afford to produce their own.
On 17 January 2020, the Germans announced their own version, which was not available until 28 January, and was developed by the US Centers for Disease Control, resulting in delays in the US testing. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of existing test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to meet the supply of existing kits and the recommendations of medical experts.
However, experts say that South Korea's extensive testing system has helped to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capabilities, especially in private laboratories, have been built up over the years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called on countries to increase testing and protocols as the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19.The increased demand for testing equipment due to the spread of the virus has led to many of these being outsourced to US laboratories, creating a critical shortage of medical supplies and vaccines.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the reliability of its testing equipment.
In the United States, the National Institute of Disease Control's equipment was found to be defective, and the government removed the barriers to independent testing.Spain purchased equipment from Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, a Chinese company, but found it to be defective.
The institute explained that incorrect results could be due to improper sampling or improper use of equipment.
The Spanish Ministry of Health said it would remove the devices that gave false results and replace them with those made by Shenzhen Bioeasy.Eighty percent of the devices purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million devices from China that were found to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič has called for the test kits to be dumped in the Danube River. Ateş Kara, the Turkish Minister of Health, said that the test kits purchased in China were of poor quality and should not be used. Britain bought 3.5 million test kits from China but recently in April 2020 they were declared unusable.
Testing, followed by quarantine and contact tracing of SARS-CoV-2 infections, has been successful.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first Italian COVID-19 death, double-tested the entire population of 3,400, over a period of ten days.
About half of those found infected were asymptomatic, and all those found to be infected were isolated.
The restrictions on travel to other areas effectively stopped the spread of the disease.
Due to strict contact tracing, movement restrictions, sampling and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in Singapore was relatively low compared to other developed countries and was avoided by the complete closure of restaurants and shops.
Many activities were suspended, and Singapore began advising people to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after the holiday on 23 March.
Many countries that have also dealt with the epidemic implement contact tracing, domestic travel restrictions, testing, quarantine, and stay-home measures but not strictly, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistical studies have shown that countries with high measurement rates, relative to mortality, have lower mortality rates, possibly because these countries have the ability to identify those with mild or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries that do not have the testing capacity and do not have sufficient and capable laboratories to test for COVID-19 submit their own samples from the first five confirmed cases and the first ten confirmed cases of COVID-19 to the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation.
Of the 16 model laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Infected as % of test subjects" may vary depending on the national testing policy.
A country that tests only hospitalized individuals will have a higher rate of infection in the sample, compared to a country that tests the entire population, symptomatic or not, if nothing else changes.
Hand washing, also known as hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands to remove dirt, grease, germs, or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing at "essential times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People can catch respiratory illnesses such as the common cold or flu, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their face, nose or mouth (i.e., genitals).
The five key times of day when handwashing with soap is important include: before and after a bite, after petting or changing a baby's diaper, before feeding a baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hands may be washed with ash.The United Nations Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing a baby's diaper or after cleaning a child's toilet.
After you cough, sneeze, or rub your mouth.
After handling, feeding, or cleaning an animal's excrement.
Medical hand hygiene refers to medical hygiene practices.
Handwashing before administering medication or before caring for a patient can prevent or greatly reduce the spread of disease.
The primary purpose of hand washing in healthcare is to clean hands of contaminated hands (bacteria, viruses, or other germs that can cause disease) and medications that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for those who prepare food or work in the medical field, but it is also a good practice for everyone.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing other causes of diarrheal illness; reducing respiratory illness;
It also reduces the mortality rate of home-born babies.
A 2013 study found that hand washing can improve the health and development of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple approach can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Encouraging handwashing could reduce about one-third of diarrheal infections and this is equivalent to providing safe water in middle-class areas.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea-related diseases can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory illness (ARI), and should be a standard practice at home, school, and in the larger community.
Pneumonia, the most serious form of respiratory illness, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, claiming the lives of 1.8 million children annually.
Both measles and mumps kill about 3.5 million babies each year.
Based on data from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), regular use of soap before and after meals and using a towel can save more lives than any vaccine or other treatment, and reduce by almost half the deaths from diarrhoea and by a quarter the deaths from severe respiratory illnesses.
Handwashing is often included in other hygiene activities as part of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against skin infections that are transmitted through contact with others.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to excessive dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause irritation, hardening of the skin, commonly called hand-nose disease, which is more common among healthcare workers.
Excessive hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five key times of the day when hand washing with soap is essential to reduce the spread of infection through the latrine and mouth: after using the toilet (sitting, coughing), after defecating a child (turning the diaper), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Handwashing should also be used to prevent transmission of infection, including before and after treating a wound or sore; after sneezing, coughing, or rubbing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after handling human waste.
In many countries, there is a low standard for handwashing with soap.
A handwashing study conducted in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households used soap to wash their hands.A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%; the United States had almost 77%; and China had the lowest rate at 23%.Today, there is a way to change attitudes to promote handwashing with soap in critical situations.Handwashing at the same time for schoolchildren at the same times each day is one of the most effective ways to teach handwashing culture in developing countries.
The Health Care Excellence Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is a good example of a program that aims to improve children's health and education.
A twice-yearly oral rehydration, combined with daily hand washing with soap, daily flossing with fluoride, is the basis of this national program.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of bacteria from the skin is enhanced by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main benefit of soaps and detergents is to reduce waste barriers and increase efficiency.
Water alone does not adequately cleanse the skin because fats and oils, which are more like soil, are not easily soluble in water.
Sanitation, which involves the use of sufficient water.
Non-water soaps, by being reusable, can retain infectious agents from previous users.
A small number of studies have examined the transmission of germs from contaminated soap and found that transmission is impossible because the germs are wiped away by the foam.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) still says that "water soap and its use without touching the soap is the best option".
The disinfectant soap has been highly praised by people who are concerned about their health.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of antibiotics or antibiotics is preferred over antibiotics for known antibiotic resistant insects.
However, disinfectant soaps containing insecticides such as triclosan, have a large list of resistant insects.
Thus, even if the antibiotics are not selected from the antibiotics, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to protecting the exposed surface and the skin, the products may contain acids (acetic acid, acidocyl sulfuric acid, lactic acid) such as hydrogens, benzoic acid, antimicrobial agents, and other skin protective agents (such as aloe vera, coumarin, menthol, and other herbal remedies). A study by the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that regular soap has the same level of antimicrobial resistance and antibacterial activity on the hands as antibacterial soaps.
The hot water that can be used for hand washing is not hot enough to kill the germs.
infectious organisms grow rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing oils containing soil and contaminated insects.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water is not effective in reducing microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a water-free hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand washing with disinfectant (commonly known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers) became popular and widespread.
Most is made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol which is produced by adding carbomer to a milk product or by adding a solvent such as glycerin to the product to make it more easily digestible and reduce the effects of alcohol.
The addition of free hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol may be effective in killing bacteria.
Hand sanitizers contain alcohol that kills bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinoviruses, smallpox, influenza, and hepatitis) as well as viruses that cause paralysis.
A 70% hand sanitizer kills 99.97% (3.5 decimals, equivalent to a 35 decibel decimation) of hand parasites within 30 seconds of use and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 decimals) of hand parasites within 1 minute of use. Hand sanitizers are effective against most bacteria but have little effect against viruses.
Hand sanitizers appear to have little effect against norovirus (Norwalk), the most common cause of gastrointestinal infections.Hand sanitizers should be used in such a way that they do not rub or spread on both hands.
The front and back of the hands and the middle and ends of all fingers should be rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until water, foam, or dry cleaning solution is applied.
It is important to wash the fingertips thoroughly by rubbing them together with both hands.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand sanitizing, especially if the hands are obviously contaminated.
Continued use of this method is based on its ease of use and rapid elimination of pathogens; however, this method should not replace standard hand washing methods unless soap and water are readily available.
Frequent use of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless the medications in the hand sanitizer soften or prevent skin dryness.
This alcohol-induced dryness can be reduced or eliminated with glycine or other skin moisturizers.
In clinical trials, hand sanitizers containing alcohol but also containing a skin moisturizer have been shown to reduce skin resistance compared to soaps or antibiotics.
Skin rash, rashes or irritation due to alcohol in hand sanitizer are rare.
The low risk of skin damage makes this method more common compared to hand washing with soap and water.
While effective, a hand sanitizer without water does not clean hands of all dirt, but only of the contaminated areas.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of most viruses, as the virus remains on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients, and in the past it has been less effective than alcohol and other alcohol-derived detergents.
More recently, benzalkonium chloride-based products have been shown to have a long-lasting antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease its effectiveness after repeated use, possibly due to its adverse effects on the skin.
Many people in low income areas cannot afford to buy soap and therefore use ash or dirt.
Using clay or soil is a better alternative to using only water, but it is not as effective as using soap.
One concern is that the ash or soil may contain microorganisms that can be infectious and thus increase the spread of the disease rather than reducing it.
Like soap, ash kills germs by reacting with water to form an acid.
If soap is not available, the World Health Organization recommends the use of sand or gravel.
The recommended handwashing practices by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of the disease are as follows:
Wash your hands with cold or hot, liquid water.
Liquid water should be used as the water in the basin can be contaminated, and the water temperature is not significantly affected.
Wash your hands with a foam, wipe them with plenty of soap, and wash the back of the hand, between the fingers, and under the elbow.
Soap removes pathogens from the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands more effectively with soap than with water.
Hold your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Squeezing the hands frequently produces a skin-to-skin reaction, which helps to remove pathogens from the skin, and rubbing the skin frequently removes the bacteria.
Rinse your hands thoroughly with running water.
Hands soaking in the bath can re-infect the hands.
Wash your hands with a clean cloth or with a blow-dryer.
Hands that are wet or dry can easily become contaminated again. The most common areas of contamination are the toe, the elbow, the space between the fingers, and even under the fingernails.
The spores or the colored spores can be a breeding ground for bacteria.
Skin lotion is recommended for people with dry hands; dry skin can be damaged and increases the risk of spreading infection.
Other simple methods can be used to facilitate handwashing when faucets or soap are not available, such as pouring water using a tree-mounted jar (sandbag) or a metal container with a special hose or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In cases of water shortage (such as in school buildings or rural areas in developing countries), there are cost-effective ways of collecting water such as with a handbag.
The water softener is a simple technique that uses a rope attached to a straw, rubbing water with the foot, rinsing a small amount of water in the hands, and soap.
Proper hand washing is an important part of hand hygiene, but there is still some debate about the best method of hand washing in public restrooms.
Many studies have shown that paper towels are cleaner than electric hand dryers in large bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London, with the support of The European Tissue Symposium, conducted a study to compare the hygiene benefits of a tissue, a hand sanitizer, and a hand sanitizer.
After washing and rinsing hands with a hot air hand dryer, the total number of pathogens was found to increase by an average of 194% on the fingers and an average of 254% on the palms.
Hand-washing with a hand-blower increased the total number of pathogens by an average of 42% on the fingers and by an average of 15% on the palm.
After washing hands and wiping them with a paper towel, the total number of germs was reduced by an average of 76% on the fingertips and 77% on the palms.The researchers also conducted studies to determine the potential for cross-contamination between people using the toilet and the surrounding environment due to each type of wiping method.
The device, which also emits air at a speed of 180m/s (650km/h; 400mph), could remove infectious particles from the hands and other parts and the ability to infect other bathroom users and to pick up the particles at a distance of up to 2 metres.
Using a hot air hand dryer will kill bacteria up to 0.25 metres from the hand dryer.
Our paper towels have been shown to be less susceptible to bacterial contamination.In 2005, a TÜV Produkt und Umwelt study evaluated various hand sanitizing methods.
The following changes were observed in the number of pathogens after handwashing:
There are many hand sanitizer manufacturers, and hand sanitizer has been compared to hand sanitizer paper.
Hand washing with a hand sanitizer is another method that can be used when traveling without water and soap.
Alcohol in hand sanitizer must be at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its usefulness (in 1846) for preventing disease in hospitals.
Electronic devices are used to remind healthcare professionals to wash their hands if they forget to do so.
Some studies have shown that their use has reduced the rate of infection.
Hand washing in the clinical setting lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or a special foam solution and rubbing both hands together.
The fingers should be folded in a very close position.
If there is dirt under the nail, a special brush can remove it.
Since the infected bacteria are able to stay in the water on the fingers, it is important to rinse thoroughly and thoroughly wipe the hands with a clean cloth.
After hand washing, a paper towel should be used to seal the water (and open the outlet if necessary).
This prevents the hands from becoming contaminated again from the affected area.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare settings is to remove germs that can cause disease and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing is still a challenge in clinical settings, where large numbers of doctors and nurses often forget to wash their hands before touching patients; this can lead to the spread of infectious diseases.
One study found that hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the incidence of bloodborne diseases by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a document that describes the safe practice of hand washing and the use of hand sanitizers in the health sector.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines issued by the institute can be found on its website for public comment.
The major revision was done by Whitby et al.
Commercial equipment can test and certify hand hygiene, if required to demonstrate compliance with the regulations.
The World Health Organization has identified "Five Times" for hand washing:
of contact with blood/fluid after
before the procedure, and
After treating the patient.Adding antibiotics to soap (antibacterial soaps) makes hand washing more effective at killing germs.
This method of disinfection may be necessary before surgery or in areas with high concentrations of antibiotic-resistant organisms.For a safe hand wash before surgery, it is necessary to have a hand-closure and unclosure tap, chlorhexidine or iodine hand sanitizer, a hand sanitizer with a hand sanitizer after washing, and a hand sanitizer with a hand sanitizer and a hand sanitizer with a hand sanitizer.
You have to take off all your makeup.
This method requires hand-to-elbow hand washing, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
Finger-waving for a long time (10 minutes) is not required.
When rinsing your hands, make sure that the water is not on your hands and reaching down to your fingers.
After washing your hands, wipe them with a clean cloth and put on a sacred garment.
To reduce the risk of infection, it is important to wash hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a patient.
In clinical studies of staphylococcal infections, it was found that most of the benefits of hand washing were obtained from the first 20% of washing, with a small increase in the benefits when the frequency of hand washing was increased to more than 35%.
Washing with plain soap produced a three times higher rate of foodborne illness than washing with disinfected soap.Comparing the use of hand sanitizer and disinfected soap for 30 seconds, both showed that the use of hand sanitizer reduced the incidence of infection by 26% compared to disinfected soap.
However, washing with soap and water is preferable to using hand sanitizers to reduce the risk of A/H1N1 influenza virus and other virulent organisms remaining on the hands. Hand hygiene improvement activities in clinics may include teaching hand washing to staff, increasing hand sanitizers, and providing written and verbal reminders to staff.
More research is needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in healthcare across a wide range of settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an important and inexpensive way to achieve good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of regular access to water, soap, or handwashing devices in private homes, schools, and workplaces is a major barrier to achieving universal handwashing practices.
For example, in many rural areas of Africa, hand-washing taps near public or private toilets are still scarce, although there are cheaper alternatives to building hand-washing facilities.
However, the low prevalence of handwashing may be due to the increased prevalence of handwashing habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and promoting handwashing with soap can have a positive impact on policy, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioural changes in the population.
In order to ensure that this is done in a systematic manner, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
A review of 70 studies found community-based approaches to increase hand washing in LMICs to be effective, while online promotion of hand washing in schools was not.One example is the "Three-Star Method" by UNICEF to promote hand washing in schools by encouraging schools to use simple, cost-effective methods to promote hand washing with soap and other hygiene products.
If the baseline is met, schools can go from one star to three stars.
Building handwashing facilities could be one of the initiatives to promote handwashing practices to reduce childhood illness and death.
Global Handwashing Day is another example of a campaign to promote handwashing as part of a drive to achieve behavioral change goals.Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has promoted handwashing emoji.
Few studies have shown the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to DALYs.
However, one study found that promoting handwashing with soap was more effective than other water-based cleaning practices.
The importance of hand washing in human health, especially for vulnerable people such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers wounded in battle in hospitals, was recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the Englishwoman who "revived the practice of nursing".
At that time, many people still believed that infectious diseases were caused by bad odors called phlegm.
In the 1980s, foodborne and drug-related infections led the US CDC to increase its emphasis on hand hygiene as a key method to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 swine flu pandemic and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have increased the awareness of countries on the importance of handwashing with soap to prevent the transmission of these infectious diseases.
For example, large signs with the words "best hand washing practices" have been hung next to handwashing racks in public restrooms of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The term "washing one's hands" in a certain context refers to a person's unwillingness to admit his or her actions or to condone the conspiracy in the act.
It originated in the biblical Gospel of Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands after his decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but the phrase remains in common use in the English-speaking world.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands to remove a supposed stain, indicating that she is remorseful for her sins and for what she caused her husband to do.
It has been found that people, after remembering or thinking about doing something wrong, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and value hand sanitiser more than others.
And, those who are allowed to wash their hands after contemplating these wrongdoings are less likely to engage in other "cleansing" acts of repentance such as voluntary acts.
Some religions require their adherents to wash their hands for hygiene and to perform rituals. Hand washing, which is a religious practice, using only water and no soap to wash hands, is a part of the culture of many different religions, including Jainism, Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Religions also require their adherents to wash their hands thoroughly, especially after performing special rituals.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing after using the toilet.
And Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Judaism, and Islam all require hand washing before and after each meal.
COVID-19 workplace precautions
COVID-19 workplace prevention measures are critical to workplace safety and health to prevent the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The most effective workplace containment measures depend on the workplace and the workplace, based on an analysis of the risk of disease, the prevalence of disease in the community, and the risk to individual workers who are vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest risk of exposure to a virus is defined as work in which workers have a high level of contact with people and other employees, where basic precautions for infection are in place, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when sick, instructions for respiratory disease prevention and regular hygiene and disinfection of the workplace.
A low-risk occupation is one that requires frequent contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may have been infected because of the contagion of other people or travel abroad.
This includes workers who interact with the general public such as those working in schools, public places and shops that serve large numbers of customers.
The infection control for these workers is in addition to the basic precautions, including adequate ventilation with air fresheners, personal protective equipment, and personal protective equipment for contact with a person who has been infected with COVID-19.
OSHA requires that health care and recreation workers who have been in close contact with a person with or suspected of having COVID-19 are at a high risk of infection, which is increased if the employee is involved in the ventilation, sampling or testing of a person with or suspected of having COVID-19.
The best prevention for these workers includes the use of appropriate equipment such as airtight compartments and protective clothing appropriate to the workplace.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have a wide range of impacts on the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work due to illness, need to care for others, or fear of infection.
Business models may change, both in terms of how goods are shipped and how those goods are purchased (such as buying goods during off-peak hours or services for delivery or delivery in vehicles).
Finally, the supply of goods from COVID-19-affected areas may be disrupted.
Risk plans cover a wide range of workplaces and workplaces, including potential sources of exposure, risks from home and community and personal risks to employees due to age or chronic illness.
They also outline the key steps in disease control by eliminating these risks and other measures that could be used in the event of an epidemic failure.
Prevention and control plans for communicable diseases may be implemented at the national or regional level.
Measures to control the outbreak in specific populations include reducing transmission among workers, protecting people who are at high risk due to other illnesses, maintaining business reopening and reducing the impact on other facilities in the processing and distribution of goods.
The prevalence of disease in the community where the business is located may affect the measures taken.
A series of control measures are commonly used to control the disease and to protect the safety and health of workers in accordance with their productivity.
Where it is not possible to contain the spread of COVID-19, the most effective method of controlling the spread is the use of appropriate personal protective equipment, followed by appropriate management measures and personal protective clothing.
The purpose of anti-infection measures is to protect workers from work-related hazards regardless of the worker's behavior and can be reliable in their implementation.
Management actions are changes to the workplace policies or procedures that require implementation by the employee or the employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than the previous two approaches, but can help to prevent infection.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the hazards the worker is exposed to, properly related to the work (e.g., respiratory), regularly and carefully worn, regularly inspected, handled and modified as necessary and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of for recycling.
According to the US Department of OSHA, the lowest risk of exposure is the workplace that is in close contact with people in general or with co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures must be followed at all workplaces and include frequent hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home when sick, respiratory health precautions including covering up when coughing or sneezing, providing clean towels and a dedicated toilet, organizing electronic communication, avoiding rotation of workers entering and leaving the workplace if necessary, preventing use of peer equipment, and frequent cleaning and disinfecting of the workplace.
Early detection and quarantine of potential contaminants is an important part of the safety of workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The US CDC recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until the fever, symptoms of fever and other symptoms have subsided and do not take antipyretic or other symptomatic medication for 24 hours and simplifies the procedure for requesting sick leave, allowing employees to stay home if a family member is ill, and informing employees of such procedures.
According to OSHA, a low-risk occupation is one that requires frequent contact or close contact within 1.8 m of people who are not known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 through contact with other people in a business setting or because people have recently traveled to a location where COVID-19 infection is present.
There are also workers who are exposed to the general public such as those working in schools, workplaces with high crowds and shops that are frequented by large numbers of customers. Preventing infection by using equipment designed for these workers and other high-risk groups includes ventilators, increasing the number of ventilators, and introducing a new COVID-19 prevention program that protects employees from exposure to the virus and provides a window to protect customers from unnecessary exposure to the virus. Management measures to prevent infection for workers and other high-risk groups of workers include encouraging employees to stay indoors, changing home screenings to avoid unnecessary use of personal protective equipment, preventing workers from being exposed to workplace or workplace fire, and providing COVID-19 prevention programs to help workers avoid exposure to COVID-19, and other workplace safety measures, including the introduction of a COVID-19 safety plan, the availability of personal protective equipment, the reduction of employee exposure to COVID-19, and the introduction of a workplace safety plan, including a health and safety briefing, personal protective equipment, and other measures to reduce the risk of exposure to workers.
Workers in this vulnerable group are rarely required to use respirators.
When a patient is sick on board an aircraft, appropriate measures should be taken to protect the safety of the flight crew and other passengers, including isolating the patient from other people and keeping a distance of 2 meters, appointing a flight attendant to provide medical care to the patient, providing a mask, or helping to cover the patient's mouth and nose with cloth when he coughs or sneezes.
Aircrew must wear disposable medical gloves when assisting a patient on board or handling bodily fluids or handling potentially contaminated surfaces and wear protective clothing designed for emergencies when a patient on board has a fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other hand tools should be wrapped in a special container and the contaminated surface should be cleaned and disinfected after use.On passenger ships, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, virus control includes delaying travel in case of illness and self-quarantine and reporting to the ship's emergency department if a person experiences a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical attention should be provided when the person is in isolation.For schools and nursing homes, the CDC recommends temporary isolation for cleaning or disinfection when an infected person is found in a school building, not as a contagious person.
Despite the low or high rate of transmission between people, social distancing measures can be implemented by suspending classes and public gatherings such as physical exercise or choir lessons or catering in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between chairs and tables, leaving room for one person to enter or leave, allowing unnecessary visits and using a separate clinic for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is an outbreak in the community, in addition to social distancing measures, long school closures may be considered. For security personnel in day-to-day roles, the risk of immediate infection is low according to the CDC.
Personnel who have come into contact with a person who is confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are required to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical personnel, including the use of protective clothing.
In the event of contact during an arrest, staff must wipe and disinfect their clothing and equipment before re-use with household cleaners or wiping cloths and follow the standard instructions for storing and disposing of used protective clothing and for storing and washing clothes.
OSHA recommends that some health and recreation workers be in the high or very high risk categories.
High-risk occupations include healthcare, laboratory, and transportation workers who have been in or out of hospital care who may have been in contact with a person known to have or suspected to have COVID-19.
These are at increased risk of infection if the personnel perform tasks that include ventilating patients, collecting or testing samples from people known to be or suspected to be infected with COVID-19.
Respiratory therapy includes intravenous administration, coughing, bronchial administration, some dental procedures and examinations or internal measurements.
The highest risk of respiratory infection is associated with personnel handling bodies of people known or suspected to have had COVID-19 at the time of death; they are at higher risk when performing lethal imaging. And infection control using dedicated facilities includes risk groups including quarantine rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including conducting ventilation for patients.
A special ventilator may be appropriate for some healthcare and recreational workers.
Samples should be taken according to the clinical safety level 3 guidelines.
WHO recommends that patients who come to a hospital are quarantined in the waiting room due to suspected COVID-19. As for personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends respirators for those working within 2 meters of known or suspected infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2 and those performing ventilatory activities.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 or better respirators must be used according to a well-designed, documented respiratory safety program including appropriate testing, training and clinical evaluation.
Other types of respirators can protect the wearer better and make the worker more comfortable. WHO does not require workers to wear respirators because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than a fluid-borne disease.
WHO recommends that only medical masks be worn by staff visiting various facilities.
For those who are taking respiratory samples, caring for, or carrying COVID-19 patients who are not in a ventilation unit, WHO recommends the wearing of a medical mask, goggles or mask, gown, and gloves.
When ventilation is performed, the medical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Due to the global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), WHO recommends reducing the need for personal protective equipment to self-care, introducing window separation, and limiting direct access to a COVID-19 room to healthcare providers, using PPE only when necessary for specific tasks, continuing to use the same breathing apparatus without interruption while treating multiple patients with the same illness, monitoring and coordinating the manufacture of PPE and preventing the use of masks for non-symptomatic patients.

IMPAMVU: [Covid-19] Lighten the load and prepare for the future
The name of the city is "Sharon" (Sharon).

We are facing a unique situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a clear indication that the world has become a village and that we need to help each other.
We have not faced these challenges before, but we know that the best way to deal with the pandemic is to understand the global challenges, to work together and to keep the community united.
The warmth and concern we have seen in all our colleagues through email, phone calls and chat is a reflection of the extraordinary personality we have had the privilege of working with you.
I cannot thank you enough or express how proud I am of all of you as fellow workers.
Last week, someone expressed his appreciation for our work.
It reminded me of how the world is turning to Wikipedia today, which is a strong indication that it is a valuable resource and should remain online and accessible to all.
Your job is what makes it possible, whether it's keeping the site up and running or our colleagues paid or our workplace safe.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia now more than ever.
This is the time when not only what we do, but how we do it, will make a positive difference in the world.
Due to the importance of this role and the role it entails, we will make necessary changes to our working methods, starting from next week.
Adaptability to our activities and schedule
As Robyn said, our group met last night to discuss our approach and our schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we discussed what we thought would be the right answer to what we are facing and the best way to keep the family going in this time.
We especially wanted to remove obstacles and support our missions for the long term.
If you want to call, that's fine.
To the ministers, to the commissioners and to all the clergy:
The expected hours of work are 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We do not call this a holiday; if you are able to work normal hours we can use this for our responsibilities.
But today, the world is changing and if you need to take care of your loved ones, shop for food or go to the mall, your life is at stake.
We don't keep track of your work time.
If you are sick, do not go to work.
We have not mentioned it, but we have mentioned it.
You do not need to request sick or paid leave, but you should inform your supervisor and help your team to review schedules and schedules so that the core work can continue.
(If you have a positive test for COVID-19, contact Bryan at T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can provide you with the appropriate management support and attention.)
Those who are paid by the hour will be paid in full.
We have renewed our commitment to our contractual and hourly workers.
Each person will be paid based on the actual hours worked in normal conditions.
This includes when you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to escape the stress of the world.
What we do can be very useful especially in these times.
And the point is, you take care of yourself.
Our advice is to talk to your supervisor, so that we can understand what to expect and adjust our process accordingly.
Some jobs are considered essential.
There are things we should keep doing.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety and fundraising teams (and others) do the core work that requires additional support.
We will begin to review all departments to assess the current goals and adjust our focus to support the priorities of our assignments.
There are important things that we all need to do, but there are important projects that we need to focus on.
A few actions now will not have any effect.
We do not plan to work nearly twice as hard to recoup our losses once the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to work overtime to meet your deadline, which is currently not possible.
We accept the change and will work to set new goals and timelines where appropriate.
What will happen to the yearly plan?
To make the change consistent with the current standard working hours, we would like to change the schedule of the 2020-2021 program.
Our intention is to request an extension of the 2019-2020 budget period to allow time for budgeting by allowing employees to prioritize their primary work, care of themselves and their loved ones while helping those who want or need to work less hours in the next few weeks.
This increase in schedules significantly reduces the workload and the pressure on the entire family.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and will update the other delegates and groups on the next guidelines as soon as possible after they are approved.
The planning team has responded positively to the leadership skills demonstrated.
Conditions of the workplace, exposure and hygiene
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues working in SF had been in contact with a person who may have contracted COVID-19.
However, due to the extreme care, we hired the anti-virus cleanup team to spray disinfect the entire San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-level virus system and disinfected every entryway and bank elevator that led to our office.
The building is implementing anti-virus protocols with user-friendly security features.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared if we decide to reopen it.
Our DC office, located in WeWork, shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all employees in DC.
Until last week, our DC office had been switched to a fully remote-operated system in compliance with San Francisco's guidance.
As some of our NYC colleagues know, we had begun negotiations to rent an apartment in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of my colleagues were working with a remote for the first time.
Our existing customers know that it can be changed and we would like to advise them:
Limit the duration of the meeting to one or two hours if there is a delay.
If lessons are not needed, consider how to break the lessons into several days.
To define the conference, to have a clear line of study and to send documents in advance.
Stop using video as a primary tool and use apps like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and sharing of information in an instant manner.
In addition to the CEO chairing each meeting, there is a person who oversees the interview and the list of speakers and a person who records the meeting minutes (or co-writes the meeting minutes).
Email technical support if you need a good speaker.
Eat a simple diet to maintain good health.
Go to the #remoties channel on Slack to report challenges in completing a task
The work of the Personnel Group reviews the guidelines for the online training programmes in order to take advantage of the support and increase the workload of the Organization.
This past week, we asked all funding agencies to suspend public fundraising activities for Wikimedia such as training for new online writers, until the WHO declared the pandemic over.
We have told them that we understand that requiring them to stop these activities and comply with other regulations makes it very difficult to complete the fundraising activities they have committed to and that no one will punish them for delaying or changing their targets.
Next week, we will be following up on more guidelines on Wikimania and other regional and area-specific meetings.
The general attitude towards the global community is sad about the shutdown but there is comfort, understanding and the ability to focus on their own families, Wikimedia and others.
Therefore, CRT is creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide the community with the opportunity to monitor the impact and follow up with our newsletter.
Keeping up with COVID-19 updates
We will send you an invitation to your conference call next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to update you, answer your questions, and spend more time with you.
We are all in this together and are here to help each other as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to access the content of this email and other relevant COVID-19 information on the Wiki Office.
The CRT will keep these pages updated and all information will be in one place.
We are also looking for ways to maintain contact with workers living in countries currently affected by the epidemic.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, performance or internet issues or anything else that you need help with, please let us know and work with CRT.
We are here to help you coordinate your actions as needed.
If you have a specific or sensitive issue, please email Bryan Judan, Global Human Resources and Operations Executive Director.
None of these changes should be considered as resigning from our job or responsibilities.
Rather, it is to show that today, our jobs and responsibilities are more likely to change in ways that have never been seen before.
These are the steps we believe are necessary to help each other stay in business, do our job according to the help they need and provide the world with a service it can depend on.
The work we planned would be there waiting for us until the time came.
For now, we are in a time of mutual aid and finding time for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly months.
We need all of you to make it happen and we need you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you are well when you need to be.
Now, you should wash your hands and not touch your face!
The first group of participants was the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the remaining members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a protein that makes the hormone attached to the outer surface (cell walls) of cells in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 modulates the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) protein by reducing the concentration of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a promising target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.ACE2 also serves as a target for the entry into the cell of some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-con 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the endothelial surface and other tissues.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase M2 and the C-terminal collectrin that carries medicinal acid through the kidney.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I protein with a high protein binding region in the lung and other cells.
The extracellular portion of ACE2 is cleaved onto the cell membrane by another enzyme-forming protein known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein enters the membrane and then exits the cell.
ACE2 is found in many tissues: ACE2 is expressed in the cell membranes of mainly type II lung cells, small intestinal cells, vascular and nervous cells, and in the vascular tissues of many tissues.
ACE2 mRNA expression is found on the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex.
The primary function of ACE2 is to regulate the actual concentration of ACE.
ACE inhibitors are inhibitors of angiotensin I and angiotensin II that act as blood vessels and slow blood flow.
ACE2 also synthesizes the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine in angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses into the angiotensin I-7, which is a major blood-borne receptor (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also decompose peptides such as [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also activates the amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and plays a role in Hartnup's disease.
As a transcription protein, ACE2 serves as an important gateway to the genome of some coronaviruses, namely HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the association of the S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 subunit of the cell is responsible for endocytosis and migration of the virus from its original host site to the enzyme-specific proteins of the host cell.
This pathway also regulates the S-protein's ability to bind to TMPRSS2, and research is currently investigating inhibition of its activity as a potential therapeutic target.This has led to the hypothesis that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may be effective in controlling the disease.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have called for the maintenance of ACE inhibition at the recommended dose and treatment of ARB.
A non-compliant review and a more extensive analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia was reduced in patients at high risk of infection treated with ACE inhibitors, particularly in patients with heart failure, and in patients with cardiac insufficiency.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in deaths from pneumonia, although the effect was less important than the risk of pneumonia in general".
ACE2 (rhACE2) is being touted as a novel treatment for chronic lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary circulation and oxygenation in areas infected with bacterial pneumonia.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes later than the onset of action (time) in the general population.
Several studies have found that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment option for people with renin-angiotensin suppressor (RAS) intolerance or for diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated.Injection of rhACE2 has been studied in a clinical trial for the treatment of acute respiratory syndrome.
COVID-19 is a mobile application designed to help identify contacts in the search for a cure for the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, for example, in the process of identifying people ("numbers") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many programs have been developed or are being used by the public, with government support in some provinces and some municipalities.
Several frameworks for building a contact tracing application have been developed.
Concerns about the privacy of personal data have been raised, especially with respect to location-based system specifications for application users.
Another highly intrusive alternative is to use Bluetooth-enabled broadcasting to access other mobile phones using the respective app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would be adding the app to support applications based on Bluetooth data that are instantly installed on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities.In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app, developed by a large community of IT and communications experts, was released as an open source resource and will be made available to the government.North Macedonia has released "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app that detects contacts of severely infected people and provides a quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Information and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is pending approval in the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government said the contact tracing application was in advanced development and would be available for distribution in the following weeks.Such programs are being developed in Ireland, and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering mobile apps modeled on Singapore's TraceTogether and Russia's BlueTrace.Russia is planning to launch a mobile app that will keep COVID-19 patients in Moscow in contact, making sure they have not left home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security policy implementation at Cambridge University, has listed a number of practical problems with mobile app-based systems, including those that are sick and healthy and the inability to function properly if the use of these apps is limited to a small percentage of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of these misleading or malicious coronavirus apps, Apple has set a limit on the types of organizations that can upload coronavirus apps to the App Store, allowing only "officially approved" or otherwise trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Individuals have expressed concerns about mobile surveillance, particularly whether the coronavirus surveillance infrastructure will be removed once the pandemic is over.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations published a document calling for a reduction in the use of this self-censorship.
These groups have identified eight government policies for their projects:
The inspection must be lawful, necessary and proportionate to its purpose ";
the period of self-assessment and self-checks should include a timeline;
the information should only be used for COVID-19-related purposes;
and confidentiality of information must be protected and disclosed in order to be protected based on evidence;
The use of technology should be impartial and non-discriminatory;
any directory must be based on the law;
There should be a system to combat and help prevent abuse;
"The active participation of all relevant stakeholders is required, including experts in public health and social exclusion groups, the German Centre for Communication Technologies (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also developed a list of priorities for care in old age.
A Google/Apple protocol designed to address the issue of persistent surveillance has been proposed to remove the tracking of infected users from their systems when they are no longer needed.
Some countries have implemented a more sophisticated approach to tracking contacts using location-based approaches rather than mobile technology, eliminating the need for mobile technology and the ability to avoid being tracked.
In Israel, a trace-based system for tracing cases has been approved.
The database-based contact tracing system has the potential to access personal information about a person's location with significant privacy implications.
However, not all digital storage systems require access to personal location data; there are many privacy-preserving systems that use databases only when data is needed to be transferred (see next section).
In South Korea, a wireless technology-based approach was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated technology that is installed in the phone, data is collected using a variety of methods including mobile phone usage, SIM card activity, and SMS notifications to people with severe cases of the virus on their phones.
In addition to using this data to identify those who have been exposed to the virus, the government has also developed a system whereby individuals can access local data, which was introduced as a result of changes to privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through various mobile applications and websites. Countries including Germany have used both national and private methods despite the privacy concerns.
As of 6 April 2020, the definitions have not been released.
The privacy-respected tracking system has been improved, based on data from at least 2013.On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups examined privacy-responsive security measures, such as the use of a Bluetooth Leet (BLE) protocol that allows users to exchange data with nearby phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a force that links national approaches to the public and does not work in a uniform manner.The public approach includes the Personal Data Protection Contact Tracking (DP-PPT), the Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN), the Holiday Contact Numbers (CEN), the Personal Health Contact Tracking (PACT) and others.
In this way, the identity of the identified individuals is not disclosed, and the identification of the encountered individuals is processed in the system.
The intelligence team at the MIT Media Lab continues to explore secure data breaches, ways to ensure the privacy of personal information and the use of geographic location tracking to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on the research "Apps Gone Rogue: Privacy by Privacy" published in March 2020.Another reported method is the Trace-Vac victim by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company, which was also developed by the MIT Media Lab.
The Trusted Contact Tracking system uses digital technology to help users communicate location and health information to authorities without compromising privacy.
On 5 April 2020, groups that shared similarities and often struggled with compliance issues formed the TCN International Forum, which aimed to coordinate and facilitate global collaboration on mobile tracking technologies, leading to a broader application.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had implemented a state-owned tracking system.
On April 10, 2020, the Android and iOS mobile operators, Google and Apple, announced the launch of Contact Tracing, a technology that the companies claimed complies with privacy standards, and which relies on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and other privacy-preserving technologies.
They also announced the technology's role in the project.
Google and Apple announce that the system is designed to be used in three phases:
collecting data to help the government develop privacy-friendly technology to track contacts
Google and Apple plan to roll out the feature to iOS and Android to address the self-censorship issue by first rolling it out to other existing platforms, and then rolling it out once the pandemic is over.
Drug repurposing, also known as drug repurposing, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching, is the process of changing a drug from a prescribed treatment to a different or different form of treatment.
This is the research pipeline for developing a reliable and effective vaccine for COVID-19.
Other studies are focused on the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and a serum-derived vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 active vaccines in various stages of clinical trials.
The field analysis provides a framework for the development of a vaccine that can target the COVID-19 cell line.
One of the main SARS-CoV-2 genes under investigation is the papillomavirus, which is related to RNA, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A, and colleagues, developed a drug that they identified as having a similar structure to conventional drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potential SARS-CoV-2 treatment in their initial research with the goal of placing it on the drug pipeline.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that can also be used to treat other autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could be added to the list of four drugs under investigation by the Solidarity drug trial group.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State will begin testing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on March 24.On March 28, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate if no other treatment is available.
This drug has not been fully approved by the FDA in a clinical trial, which is only available for EUA purposes, as an investigational drug for use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot be treated with a clinical trial.
The CDC has stated that the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reported.
The doctors declared the drug to be used only when "there is no other option".
A team of researchers in Istanbul, Turkey, is conducting a pilot study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
A comprehensive study is underway at Duke and Oxford Universities.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a clinical trial of the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in human treatment.
Chinese trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen provinces reported that favipiravir had "clear potential" to treat the disease.
35 patients in Shenzhen showed recovery in 4 days, while 45 patients without the drug took 11 days to recover.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with respiratory problems, half were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Institute reminded that the approval criteria for the drug should not be considered and that it is still in the early stages of research.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from China and keep it in its inventory, and then use the military to deliver it to a university hospital, where the drug will be used to treat patients with COVD-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has advised the Trump administration on the purchase of the vaccine, which may prove less effective in treating people affected by the outbreak in areas with high infection rates.
It is not recommended for use by women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no efficacy was observed".
These drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is currently working on a modified version of the drug to develop a vaccine to prevent replication of SARS-CoV-2.
WHO has added lopinavir/ritonavir to the World Health Organization's list of medicines for clinical trials
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg viruses.Gilead Sciences also discovered that Remdesivir can fight off resistant viruses, including parasitic, respiratory, immune-compromising, and coronaviruses.
A common challenge in the treatment of viral infections is the ability of the virus to resist drugs due to mutations that increase the severity and transmission of the disease.
Recent studies suggest that remdesivir may have a strong immunosuppressive effect.There are several ongoing studies, including two conducted at the Cleveland Clinic University Hospital; one in people with mild disease and one in patients with chronic disease.
Three clinical trials of the injectable vitamin C are underway in patients hospitalized with COVID-19; one is experimental and controlled (China, Canada) and the other is uncontrolled (Italy).
On 24 March, New York State began testing a pesticide called azithromycin.

The study, called COLCORONA, is looking at 6,000 people aged 40 and older who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have mild symptoms but do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not use a reliable method of contraception are not included in this study.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is being used more widely in the treatment of patients, which is putting pressure on health authorities in Italy to publish guidelines for the use of the drug.
On 14 April, a clinical trial of 300 patients was published in Italy on the use of enoxaparin sodium for prophylaxis and the dose of treatment.
Since the identification of SARS-CoV-2 as a virus, much of the research has focused on the proven antiviral therapies that were developed before the emergence of viruses such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile.
Ribavirin: ribavirin in the 7th edition of the Chinese Medicines Act, as a potential treatment for COVID-19
Umifenovir: umifenovir in the 7th edition of the Chinese National Health Service guidelines, has been reported as a potential treatment for COVID-19
Some antibiotics have been reported as potential treatments for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): It has been approved by China.
There is also an Italian trial. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a proposal for a vaccine for the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine is available, extensive research is being conducted to develop a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, was available for 18 months.
Five vaccines were in phase I trials in April.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
It began to spread globally in the early 2020s, prompting a large investment and research effort to find a vaccine.
Many of the companies are using existing products to develop a vaccine that can be resistant to SARS-CoV-2.
As of April, CEPI's primary focus for vaccine development is speed, availability, staffing, and global delivery.
In April, CEPI experts reported that 10 different technologies are being researched and developed by early 2020 to develop a vaccine that is effective against COVID-19.
The current phase I research includes:
The blood coatings (DNA and RNA) in phase I vaccine development are: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral cells (phase I of the vaccine research: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
According to CEPI experts in April, 115 vaccine trials are underway, including 78 confirmed trials (79 as reported by the Milken Institute), and 37 others that have been reported, but whose data is not yet clear (presumed to be planned or in development).
A Phase I-II trial assesses the safety and efficacy of a system, is conducted in a controlled, multiple-site, and randomized manner, while avoiding misunderstandings, and determines the dose that can be administered.
Phase III trials require a larger population, including a control group, to evaluate the vaccine's ability to protect against disease, while also assessing whether other vaccine side effects are reduced to a tolerable level.
Of the 79 vaccines in development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 had not yet started human trials (still in preliminary research).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced the development of a vaccine that could alter the structure of viral cells to help the immune system.

On or around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a partnership with Novavax Inc.
in the development of vaccines.
The partners also announced plans to test the vaccine and begin its Phase I trials by July 2020.
On 5 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it is developing 11 vaccines and that in the initial stages it will take at least one to one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, Medicago, a Quebec City, Quebec-based healthcare company, announced the development of a coronavirus vaccine with funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine is still undergoing laboratory research, with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier in the week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had donated large sums of money to the effort to find a Covid-19 vaccine, a move that was widely condemned by the German government.
On 5 March 2020, Pfizer announced a collaboration with German company BioNTech to develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
An mRNA-based vaccine with the designation BNT162 is currently in clinical development and its clinical trials are scheduled to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, in Italy, Takis Biotech, a healthcare company, announced that it would receive the results of the April 2020 samples and that the vaccine would be ready for human trials.
On 19 March 2020 in France, the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CEPI) announced that US$4.9 million had been invested in the COVID-19 vaccine research being conducted by Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total amount CEPI has invested in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Other CEPI partners that have invested in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
In March 2020, Russian health officials announced that experts had begun testing the animals in the testing of the vaccine.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a COVID-19 vaccine based on a blood cell line.
The vaccine was developed 14 days after the Chinese government submitted the product.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million to fund 96 projects for COVID-19 response, including several vaccines being developed at Canadian universities and research institutions, including those being developed by Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced that C$192 million was earmarked exclusively for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, with the aim of creating a "greenhouse" of vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced that they were testing a vaccine against PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine, in mice, announcing that "a SARS-CoV-2 S1 cell derivative from MNA-derived cells has demonstrated the ability to activate antibodies [in mice], which began to be seen as early as 2 weeks after administration".
On 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo's School of Chemistry announced that they were developing a DNA-based vaccine that could be administered nasally.
With the help of viricide, DNA will be synthesized and inserted into the cell to create a virus-like antibody that will activate the immune system and produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities collected data with the intent to acquire IBM's personal computers, along with other computer technology products from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have a wide range of side effects, often called undetermined effects.
This means that they may have a positive effect on immune-mediated diseases.
Another trial in Australia is recruiting 4,170 primary care physicians.
It is possible that vaccines in development will be either unsafe or ineffective.
Recent studies evaluating the efficacy of vaccines against COVID-19 in selected COVID-19 strains, such as ACE2 strains of mice and rats, suggest a need for Level 3 safety measures to manage the virus and international collaboration to enforce safety guidelines.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in animals.
As of 2020, no SARS and MERS vaccines or vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research from 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of vaccines and treatments for SARS was a priority in the agenda of governments and health agencies worldwide.
At the time of the MERS outbreak, there was a hope that the ongoing research could provide a viable method for developing vaccines and therapeutics to prevent MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed Phase I human trials, and three others were being developed, all of which are viral-based, two of which are from the Adenoviridae family (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one from the MVA family (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media spread the rumor that COVID-19 was common and that a vaccine was available.
Social media coverage has focused on the presence of genes and vaccines for other coronaviruses such as the SARS coronavirus.
The 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is a viral infection caused by the respiratory virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms of this disease include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and smell, and abdominal pain.
The infected person usually exhibits symptoms for five days but may last from two to fourteen days.
While most people infected with the virus experience mild symptoms, some experience respiratory distress and sensory loss in multiple organs.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 have recovered. The virus is transmitted through close contact, usually through the fluids released when a person coughs, sneezes or speaks.
When these fluids are released during respiration, they are usually more likely to fall to the ground or onto an object than to infect a person at a distance.
People can also become infected by contact with the virus on their face, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive in the environment for up to 72 hours.
It is most common in the first 3 days after symptoms appear, although it can be transmitted before symptoms appear and in the early stages of infection. The most reliable test is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test using nasal swabs.
It is mandatory for the person suspected of being infected and their caregivers to wear face masks.
The guidelines for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities advising against their use, others recommending it.
Currently, there is no known vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
There is a community-based transmission in all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may have no symptoms or may experience flu-like symptoms including fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Serious symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or heaviness, facial numbness, difficulty walking, facial or lip reddening; it is advisable to seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms develop.
It is uncommon to experience symptoms that include respiratory problems such as sneezing, coughing, or sore throat.
Symptoms of the common cold such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are commonly seen in the upper jaw.
Patients in China first experienced symptoms of chest tightness and heart palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can progress to respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people show symptoms by this time, which can be as early as 11.5 days after exposure. Reports indicate that not everyone who is infected is symptomatic.
The contribution of asymptomatic infections is unknown; however, the available data suggest that they may be transmissible.
The number of people who are asymptomatic is currently unknown but is being studied, based on data from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) that 20% of all infected people are likely to be discharged asymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began adding these cases to its daily case count on April 1; of the 166 cases reported that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The salivary glands can carry large amounts of the virus.
Speaking more causes more fluid to be released than speaking less.
A Singapore study of uncovered sneezes found that it can cause fluid to travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
Although the virus is transmitted through the air, the National Science Foundation says it is possible and that the air from quarantined rooms has been tested for the virus.
Medical procedures such as a chest tube and CPR may produce a gas leak which could potentially spread the infection.
While there is some doubt that a mother can transmit the virus to her unborn child, there is little evidence to suggest that it can. The virus is likely to be transmitted when people are symptomatic; while there is a small chance of transmission before symptoms are present, the virus is likely to be transmitted when people are not symptomatic.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) reports that while the transmission rate of the virus is not yet known, one person can infect two to three people.
Specifically, the virus lasted one day on a board, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and hard steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% ductile steel.
The temperature can vary depending on the temperature and the temperature of the water.
Soap and disinfectants, when used properly, can kill viruses; detergent protects the virus, stops it from spreading and removes it from the body or the surface.
Other uses include benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (an antimicrobial), but with less efficacy.In a study in Hong Kong, samples were collected within two days of admission to hospital.
Five of the six patients had a high viral load in the first test, and the sixth had a high viral load in the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 is a novel respiratory virus, first identified in Wuhan in three people with respiratory complications related to respiratory illness.
All the features of SARS-CoV-2 are found in the coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soaps, which kill the bacteria and protect the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
COVID-19 is more prevalent in the lungs, as the virus is transmitted by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) , which is predominantly expressed in the lungs.
The virus uses its spike to bind to ACE2 and enter the organism.
12% of patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China, had severe heart problems and this is common in severe illness.
The incidence of cardiovascular events is high, with inflammation and immune deficiency generally occurring with progression of the disease, but cardiovascular events may be associated with cardiac ACE2 receptor infection.
ACE2 is highly selective and affects cardiac function.
Patients in ICU with COVID-19 have reported impaired circulation (31%) and vascular damage (25%), which are associated with lower chances of recovery. Tests on patients who died from COVID-19 have shown damage to the respiratory system (DAD), as well as tumours in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 can bind ACE2 in the body and reside in the respiratory tract, patients with COVID-19 have been reported to exhibit symptoms of severe inflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF-repressed T cells have been shown to interact with IL-6-repressor cells in COVID-19 patients.
The test revealed the immune cells in the victim's body that were infected with the virus.
The WHO has published several diagnostic guidelines.
The most reliable method of detecting the disease is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Samples are taken from the respiratory tract via nasal secretions; however, a urine sample may also be used.
Results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be done, but require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results are of little value immediately.
Chinese scientists have successfully isolated the coronavirus genome and released the laboratory results to the world to freely produce a PCR assay for testing the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, tests were being developed for immune systems (which can detect current infection or past exposure), but were not yet ready for widespread use.
Chinese testing experience has shown an efficiency of 60% to 70%.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the test site on 21 March 2020 and it is expected to be operational by the end of the month.The test guidelines published by the Zhongnan University Hospital of Wuhan outlined a method for testing infection based on clinical evidence and epidemiological implications.
Infection usually begins with the virus cells hiding, aggregating, separating from the host and then spreading.
As the disease progresses, it spreads through the respiratory tract, forms a pathway (by closing the respiratory tract by closing the airway) and clumps together.
There is limited information on the microscopic imaging and the morphology of COVID-19.
The main virology tests performed on cadavers are:
Examples: swelling of the airways, swelling of the heart, narrowing of the airways
Three types of severe viral infections have been identified:
Mild anaemia: fluid in the lungs, increased airway tissue, abnormal airway tissue, tissue rupture and multiple tissue bursts
Acute pneumonia: diffuse damage to the airways (DAD) and the lungs.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and congestion of the blood vessels.
Respiratory illness is on the rise: accumulation of fluid in the airways and lungs
Blood: internal bleeding (DIC); the formation of new blood cells in the blood
Steps to reduce the spread of infection include staying home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds, keeping the respiratory tract clean and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommends that people cover their mouths with a clean cloth when coughing or sneezing or apply a mouthpiece to the forearm area of the elbow when a cloth is not available.
It is important to wash your hands after you cough or sneeze.
The CDC recommends that people wear face masks when they leave home to prevent the spread of infection from people who are not symptomatic.The social distancing measures aim to reduce the physical contact between healthy and infected people by closing schools, workplaces, and restricting travel and preventing people from gathering together.
The guidelines state that people should keep 6 feet (1.8 m) away from each other.
There is no known cure for COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected to be available until 2021, the best way to manage the pandemic is to create a curve that reduces the frequency of new COVID-19 infections, known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC recommends frequent handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are obviously contaminated, before eating, and after touching, coughing, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of prescription antibiotics with an alcohol content of at least 60%, which is used when soap and water are not available. In areas where these antibiotics are difficult to obtain, the WHO has suggested two alternative types of antibiotics.
The class of pesticides contains the pesticide ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is a disinfectant; it is not a "hand remedy".
Glycerol has also been added to the treatment regimen.
People are treated with a variety of treatments, including dialysis, ventilation, and other joint-contact procedures.
The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that people who are suspected of being infected wear a face mask.
The ECMO technique has been used to treat respiratory failure and is still being evaluated.
People are being encouraged to maintain hygiene, take care of their health and eat a healthy diet to boost their immune system.
Alternative therapeutic approaches may be used for people with mild to moderate infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have issued guidelines for the care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases collected and published clinical data from the International BclC.
As of April 2020, there is no known cure for COVID-19.
In the face of symptoms, medical experts recommend the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) as a substitute for ibuprofen in the early stages of the disease.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the spread of infection, especially in clinics when performing procedures that may cause respiratory failure, including the insertion of respiratory masks or manual ventilation.
CDC recommends that physicians treating COVID-19 patients be placed in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) while maintaining the recommended precautions, avoid contact and wear of face masks.CDC provides a list of guidelines for the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for the prevention of infection.
These include: a PPE jacket, respirator or mask, respirator, and gloves.It is recommended that respirators, if available, be used instead of masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has approved masks for emergency use (EUA).
It was designed to protect against airborne pollutants such as dust but its effectiveness against viral infections is uncertain.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face coverings or, for emergency situations, a handheld mask.
Most COVID-19 patients will not be sufficiently ventilated to require ventilation or other ventilation, but some will require it.
Clinical trials are underway to identify the type of ventilator that can be used in COVID-19 patients, and to develop a method that eliminates the use of syringes or other inhaled products.
It is not known whether these two methods yield the same results for the disease.
Some physicians prefer to retain ventilation equipment if available because it reduces air loss compared to the use of a respirator.This infection is more common in older people (over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries have a shortage of hospital beds, which creates a challenge to cope with the increasing number of people with COVID-19 who are in a critical condition and need to be hospitalized.
A Chinese study showed that 5% were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% required oxygenation and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of COVID-19 patients in hospital are receiving ICU care.
The use of air conditioning systems has become increasingly common due to the increasingly challenging nature of the respiratory problems caused by COVID-19.
More PEEP devices are needed to support ventilation to reduce the risk of injury and respiratory arrest.
The mechanism of action of PEEP devices is not found in traditional devices.
Research into potential treatments for the disease began in January 2020, and several drugs have been tested.
Remdesivir is the treatment that is making a difference.
Although it may take until 2021 for new drugs to be available, several experimental drugs are already being used to treat other diseases or have been studied.
Antiviral drugs can be prescribed for people who are severely ill.
WHO has invited volunteers to participate in studies to assess the efficacy and safety of the experimental drug.The FDA has granted a temporary exemption for the use of performance-enhancing drugs in patients with apparent life-threatening conditions.
The FDA has not evaluated the efficacy or safety of this treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile phone app in response to the spread of the pandemic.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect the presence of infection in the environment that you are using, based on information from the monitoring, so that anyone who comes in close proximity can be infected.
Each user can also view the posture of up to three other users.
Singapore, in addition to recommending self-quarantine, notifies local health authorities when an outbreak occurs. South Korea, Taiwan, and other countries are using mobile phone tracking, facial recognition, mobile phone tracking, and robotic detection to track contacts.
In March 2020, the Israeli government gave tech companies the ability to monitor cell phones of people suspected of being infected.
This decision was made to implement the quarantine and protect those who may have been in contact with those who are infected.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also provided mobile data monitoring with the support of the German government's Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed face-recognition technology to detect violations of quarantine guidelines.
Giulo Gallera, the regional health commissioner in Italy, was told by the operators of the telephone companies that "about 40% of the population is still on the move".
The German government held a 48-hour meeting with over 42,000 computer scientists.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has called on the world to find ways to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience severe depression due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of medication, or fear of the disease itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor, who said that "isolation, isolation, health anxiety, depression and poverty have a profound impact on people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may have few or no symptoms, which are similar to other respiratory illnesses or the flu.
People with mild infections may recover in two weeks, while severe ones may take three to six weeks.
Pregnant women are at increased risk of COVID-19 as reported by other viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although data on COVID-19 in pregnant women is unknown. COVID-19 can cause respiratory infections in some people.
Some people who become infected with COVID-19 may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which may result in shortness of breath, emotional distress, and multiple organ failure.
The complications of COVID-19 include systemic inflammatory and hematologic pain and damage to the heart, kidneys, and intestines.
Hemorrhagic shock, especially in the dark, was reported in 6% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized, while renal failure was reported in 4%.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated levels of transaminases.
The report also indicates that the average time between symptom onset and death is ten days, five of which are hospitalized.
However, patients who were admitted to the ICU stayed in the hospital for up to seven days before dying.
In a recent study of recent infections, the time between onset of symptoms and death was estimated to be 14 days, with an average of 6 to 41 days.
According to the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and for women 1.7%.
Tests were conducted on people who died from pulmonary diseases that showed damage to the pulmonary arteries characterized by a pulmonary embolism.
Respiratory symptoms have been associated with mutations in the virus.
The lung image appeared to be from a severe respiratory tract infection (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, there was a history of myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
A March report from the US National Health Service stated that 89% of hospitalizations were associated with other conditions. Health-related and socioeconomic factors may also contribute to the death toll.
The mortality rate varies from region to region, but also depends on the methodology used.
The lack of a number of mild cases may increase the mortality rate.
However, the high number of deaths associated with other conditions may have contributed to the decline in mortality.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to become ill or die than non-smokers.
Hong Kong hospital authorities found water retention levels of between 20% and 30% in the lungs of recovered patients, and imaging showed lung damage.
This also means that they should continue to receive care after discharge from the intensive care unit.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether the infection caused long-term immunity in people who had recovered from the disease.
The safety profile is similar, but based on the specificity of other coronaviruses, but some individuals have been found to have recovered from COVID-19 after being reported to have recovered from the coronavirus.
These individuals are thought to be more likely to be satisfied with the remaining fluid in their bodies than to be infected a second time.
It is suspected to be an untraceable and animal-derived disease, which may be transmissible from organisms.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the disease was transmitted from person to person.
A study of 41 COVID-19 patients, published in January 2020 in the Lancet, identified symptoms that began to appear on December 1, 2019.
The WHO officially announced the onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures were taken to count the number of deaths.
These figures vary depending on the region, when and how many tests were collected, the capacity of healthcare facilities, the treatment regimen used, when the outbreak began and the demographics of the population including age, gender and general health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 pandemic code U07.1 for patients with laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 and the U07.2 code for patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections from SARS-CoV-2.
Based on figures from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
The figures vary by region. Other measures include the calculation of the CFR, which is the ratio of people who test positive to die from the disease, and the IFR, which is the ratio of people who test positive to die from the disease.
These figures are not time-based and are based on the specific population of infected people according to the type of care.
While not all infected individuals will immediately develop antibodies, the presence of these antibodies can provide information about the number of infected individuals.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small community of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) had died.
In Gangelt, the epidemic was spread by Carnival festivals, infected young people, and caused a shortage of vaccines, but not all COVID-19 deaths were reported.
In addition, the German health authorities were not discouraged.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have some immune system, as shown in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) were reported to have died from COVID-19.
The incidence and severity of the disease is different in men and women.
The death rate is higher in men, according to studies in China and Italy.
Men in their 50s have a higher risk, with a difference between men and women who are only in their 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The causes of gender differences are unknown, but may be due to their physical and behavioral characteristics.
The differences in immunity between men and women, the lower incidence of smoking among women, and the higher prevalence of heart attacks in men at a younger age than in women may all contribute to the higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of the cases were male and 72% of the deaths from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the US government had not begun collecting gender-based data for COVID-19 infections.
Research on viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affects men and women differently.
A large number of physicians, especially female physicians, are female, and they are at higher risk of contracting the virus.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization officially announced the name of the disease as "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D disease, and 19 for the date of the first outbreak: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid any suggestion of a specific geographical region (e.g. China), species or group of people, and to avoid any international naming guidelines that might be derogatory or disparaging.The virus that causes COVID-19 is the second most common coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus causing COVID-19" in official communications.
Both the disease and the virus are called "coronavirus".
In the case of Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were both referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO declared 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as the provisional names of viruses and diseases in compliance with the 2015 regulation prohibiting the use of place names in the names of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limited supply, some technology companies are producing medical devices such as nasal swabs and respirators.
For example, when a hospital in Italy urgently needed air ducts and the supplier was late, a local factory quickly produced 100 units in one night.
After the first case of COVID-19 was identified, rumors, misinformation, and misinformation about its origin, its development, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease began to circulate and spread rapidly on the Internet.
Humans can transmit viruses to other animals.
Studies have failed to identify viral replication in pigs, chickens and chickens.
There is no proven cure or vaccine for the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the WHO launched the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effectiveness of four existing drugs that are suspected to treat the disease.
There is no vaccine, but several companies are testing several vaccines.
Preliminary studies of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are being used because both use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three types of immunization are being investigated.
First, the researchers want to develop a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of this virus, either inactivated or killed, is intended to stimulate the immune system to detect new infections of COVID-19.
The second step is the use of sub-particles, which is a technique that aims to create a vaccine that allows the immune system to recognize the presence of a sub-particulate virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on the membrane-like membrane that helps the virus to bind to ACE2.
The third is a DNA- or RNA-based approach to vaccine design.
Current vaccines in research trials must be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, four volunteers in Seattle began testing a vaccine.
The vaccine contains extracts from viruses that may cause disease. Immunosuppression has been suggested as a possible method for the development of a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is still a question.
As of April 2020, more than 300 vaccines are in clinical trials.
Seven trials were conducted on standard approved malaria treatments, including four on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Chinese research is focusing on generic antiviral drugs, with nine Phase III trials of remdesivir in multiple countries due to a report due by the end of April.
As of April 2020, there is an ongoing clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine. Several common antiviral drugs are being studied for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir mixed with interferon beta.
As of April 2020, there is growing evidence of remdesivir's efficacy.
Patients treated with remdesivir showed improvement.
Phase III trials are underway in the United States, Canada and Italy.Chloroquine, which is also used to treat malaria, was studied in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for more such studies.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Center for Viral Diseases, while recommending a daily intake of one gram, warns that doubling this amount could result in serious complications including death.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA provisionally approved the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.The Phase 7 regulation includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir in the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that a large dose of ribavirin is required in the response to SARS-CoV-2 that has not yet entered the environment.
Nitazoxanide can also be used for the injected virus in the study after detecting a weak SARS-CoV-2 receptor. The study found that a precursor to the injectable tissue receptor type 2 (TMPRSS2) receptor is required for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the body via the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have demonstrated significant limitations to the use of these drugs without further investigation.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 immunosuppression and has no known effect on COVID-19.
Cytokines can cause complications during the early stages of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may be a cytokine antagonist.The National Health Commission of China included Tocilizumab in the proposed regimen after a small study.
Italy is in Phase 2 trials, which include a national trial, after positive results in patients with the disease.
Together with a blood test to detect stochiness, it is intended to monitor the development of the condition, which is suspected to be the cause of some diseases.
In 2017, the FDA approved the use of interleukin-6 receptor antagonist inhibitors based on clinical research for steroid therapy with other causes, called CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no evidence that tocilizumab has the potential to treat CRS.
A study is underway to administer purified and immunologically enhanced vaccines to COVID-19 survivors who need them as a non-invasive alternative to a vaccine from a third-party vaccine.
This approach was tested for SARS but was not successful.
The viral suppression technique is a method of pre-supplementation whereby the immune system of another individual can join forces in response to SARS-CoV-2.
However, other techniques could be used, such as augmenting or boosting the immune system.
Other treatments using cloned cells are being developed, such as the use of lab-grown cells.
A blood donation system should be added, a system of collecting blood from healthy individuals and containing anti-viral agents, to ensure rapid entry into the body.
Coronavirus infections, a group of infections that are characterized by only nine symptoms.
Li Wenliang, a physician at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, contracted and died of COVID-19 after reporting a viral outbreak.
