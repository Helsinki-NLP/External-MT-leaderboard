The Czech SSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the pastry shop.
The new members of the ČSSD in the capital will, it seems, have to overcome the obvious language barriers for the members of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council to understand their renewed SDG partners.
Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new Council of the ČSSD to check their knowledge of the marked slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition governed Prague.
The coded dictionary that used the political flower and cream of Prague during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that new councillors barely understand these familiar concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know, really".
"I am a beginner in Prague politics", said culture councillor Lukáš Kaucký during the examination of "college" terminology.
And as for the veteran politician, Karel Březina reacted the same way.
You may be familiar with the concept of "golf hood".
"Maybe it's the only expression of all the ones you asked me that I use every now and then".
"If not, I usually don't use slang".
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by Aktuálně.cz last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial board selected six examples, in particular those that are particularly relevant to the municipal authorities of Prague.
Socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "going to the pastry shop", "bull neck", "capital betrayal" and "armour".
Three councillors agreed to take the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will be in charge of education in Prague in the future, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused to do so.
"I don't get into this stuff, and I'm not going to judge how civic democrats have fun".
"What matters to me is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programmes", he said.
As has been seen, it is alleged that the councillor Lukáš Kaucký did not realize that the above title is an expression about an influential businessman and friend of the former mayor of Bém, Roman Janoušek.
Kaucký is not familiar with the word "Voldemort"; the only term he got on the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel", Kaucký says, adding immediately: "But I know more about it from the news".
"I'm going to have to take a language course", he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognises the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the environment councillor Lukáš Plachý.
Afterwards, both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character; furthermore, he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague", Plachý soon learns that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
Like Březina, he indicates that he got such knowledge from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the test participants, there is no glossary of colloquial terms so familiar among the Social Democrats.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really seems we have nothing in common".
"Rather, we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or play word games with names", says the president of the Prague ČSSD, Petr Hulínský, whose party colleagues call him Hulda.
"In school they called me Březa, but I don't know if my classmates call me that too", confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
Aktuálně.cz has tested the name and it works.
For his partymates, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the election during the party sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igráček" ("playmobil") from some of his colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that the Social Democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínský does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
The "Doctor of the Law of Stamp Law" seems to recall that Petr Hulínský obtained his doctorate in Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", as published in a pamphlet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually elderly, unable to work, for example for health reasons, unmarried and childless.
Women who turn into witches are sent to an isolated area, so as not to harm the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer such otherwise".
"Healthy young women are not isolated either, because they help with the work and have children", explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, provides a special home for more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information leaflet that should help prevent the witch hunt.
However, this has a catch.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read", warns Die Standard newspaper about the disadvantages of writing awareness.
Charges of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week when she was tortured by three women and two men, covered with gasoline and burned.
The news was on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate set of circumstances.
According to her story, the woman caught herself in the oil used for ritual anointing.
It caught fire when the group wanted to "expel the evil spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "The human-devours have always been a danger", he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to quell the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that allegedly had been linked to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself through black magic".
"To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, forcibly took men and women randomly chosen from among the Gambian peoples to the president's property in Kanilai", Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the arrested people had to drink a pot of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay on the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand people detained.
The tenant in Bakala: he warms up with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The elderly and sluggish man walked through the doors of the RPG Byty customer service center of "coal magnate" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of rented flats in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying documents with the new three-story lease agreements: his own, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving his sentence.
The three of them just caught the rent liberalisation.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 crowns for a two-bedroom apartment with a separate second-class kitchen.
"Moreover, it has no hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler", the man points out in his son's new contract, over whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it", he explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, when it will publish a guide on how to proceed in these cases.
But in the face of this, man only makes a nod.
"Everyone says something", he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a great testing ground for liberalization.
After New Year's Eve will be the case for the vast majority of the apartments that were, in the Czech Republic, until now, rented under a regulated lease.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG Mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a number machine.
"Rental 2011", you can read on a bright button on your touch screen.
When you press it, a little paper with a number comes out of the machine.
It hardly takes time to read "157" and the number is already on the big screen at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly couple comes to ask, but the crowd in the room isn't here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as they used to: claims for settlements, insurance issues and the like.
Letters with the new lease agreements will arrive in Ostrava in the mailboxes of tenants of most of the 44,000 RPG-owned flats around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in their letters an increase in rent of between 15 and 38%.
On 18 November a special window opens in the customer service centre for new rentals.
"It's been running for a week, so it's starting", respond workers who are in it after a brief hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Liberalisation and the old miners' floors in Bakala are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were already treated loud and clear by the deputy speaker of Parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek, from the ČSSD, from Ostrava, and now appear continuously in local newspapers.
"Twenty years later, I want a new floor".
"They didn't even change my damn bathroom dish", says the man mentioned in the introduction.
According to the workers, for the time being they come more than anything retired to check if they receive a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as promised in the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December will also receive half the discount on the February rent.
The window of 'liberalisation' of mining certainly fails to dispel the flood of doubt.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty people asked for rent in 2011", estimates the window worker.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the parties do not agree on the rental, an independent judge must decide the matter.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely lawful way to proceed", RPG warns on its pages.
"No one is going to be judged here", says one of the employees at RPG Byty and a man in the street in front of the customer service centre gives her at least part of the reason.
"I get a pension of 13,000 and have 5,000 left over for food; I have no means to go to court", he says.
But immediately the employee seeds doubt.
"We'll see about that".
"Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people wait", he says.
Rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic by early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic need.
"The current rents still do not even cover the amounts needed to maintain the community fund", recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the RPG Byty company, who adds that the negligent state of the community fund that annoys tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years that ran between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest four billion in apartments with rentals, in the four years that will run from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The big screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data highlighted in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG properties".
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per square meter per month", the screen says.
Just a 38% increase in the 400-floor RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square meter", RPG says.
On 2,600 floors, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not hit rentals at once, but will escalate between four to eight years.
The company will invest all the money raised in the rent (see chart) back into the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to the persons who sign the rental agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need daycare.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides inside a small nursery with everything in it: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, Arch.Design employees' children have been able to visit her.
The architectural project firm Arch.Design, from whose studio many well-known buildings in Brno emerged, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-garden.
The company employs about 90 people, mostly in the baby boom age and they wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after the birth.
Along with the possibility of reduced hours, daycare is one of the benefits Arch.Design offers its workers under its social programme.
Builders and architects can thus combine a demanding profession with childcare.
The mini-garden was the idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-garden is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
With the funding granted (over CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified staff and services.
When the funding runs out (two years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to keep the mini-dining facility running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project took one year and the application for funding was submitted by Economy Rating.
The childcare is provided by qualified staff, and a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present throughout the day to care for them.
Since it is a "mini-nursery", it can only accommodate up to five children simultaneously, although with shifts more children come during the day.
The operation of the daycare centre is flexible to meet the needs of the parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the daycare centre, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the content of the nursery programme is comparable to the usual preschool programme.
Children not only play there, but also receive quality education: from basic learning to school preparation, they also teach English.
The classroom not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can visit their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up the children late from school when they are away from their workplace.
This way, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
Arch.Design is thus one of the companies that offer a great advantage for the recruitment of new workers: they support the family and, in short, this programme has strengthened the marketing of staff.
The house of bones is still fascinating after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs look like the back of a dinosaur, and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its similar shape to a skeleton, locals nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Its organic forms, striking colours, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade reminiscent of scales and the omnipresent lines gently curved, all are typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The front of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and wildlife.
By paying more attention, you observe a certain geometry, rhythm, and carefully thought out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
The serpent and the twist of the forms still surprise us inside.
The corrugated wood copies the window frames, the railings, the decorations of the doors, the viewfills, and the signs.
The Batlló House, located in the Eixample neighborhood at number 43 of the lively Passeig de Grácia shopping street, was born from the remodeling of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of making a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Batlló House, made up of various apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
Architect Josep María Jujol collaborated on the design.
In fact, in his plans for the project, decorations for the property owner's representative apartment and the mosaics used on the facade emerged.
On the facade also other creators and artists work.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Batlló House was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and the Güell de Gaudí park, in which other pieces of it are found.
Because of its organic shape, locals soon after its completion nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Others, because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began calling it "the house of the yawns".
It is also said that, at the top of the building, the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of the building hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system in the house with ventilation valves and typical chimneys.
It may seem odd that he's tilted 45 degrees.
During construction, Gaudí did not respect the building norms of the time at all and did not let himself be influenced by them.
Nevertheless, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although evidently the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, upon completion, the town hall was so shocked by the result that it asked to be corrected.
He was bothered, for example, by the fact that the building included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather the opposite: just fifteen days after the city council's request, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
The lower floors were built by the owner himself.
In the second floor gallery was the living room and on the third floor were the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery store.
The six-story house is completely crossed by a staircase leading up to the rooftop terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted in breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can communicate without problems, without renouncing the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles covering the interior courtyard and lights.
The two-color game provides maximum lighting for every floor of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit the Batlló House, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and full-fledged apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the famous creator's birth.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very profitable business and expanded the visits to the common area and the buhardilla, including the roof terrace.
The entrance fee to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, pensioners and tourist card holders get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of entry of other Gaudi constructions into the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of bed with your lizard towers, you should quickly befriend some resident of the neighboring houses and visit them at home.
How to choose a mattress and a dressing room: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous bed frame; what really confers its quality on a good bed is the surface to lie down on, that is, the mattress and the dressing room.
First of all, they must be perfectly complementary to suit the specific users.
During the election, numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the dressing room are placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "warm up" more slowly.
In addition, they often weigh considerably more than regular polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them around more often.
If the central canals are not properly ventilated and, above, are on a firm base, they keep moisture inside.
When choosing a bed, habits also influence.
Those who have spent a long time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, harder surface.
"Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here".
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic".
"These types of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have problems with the nervous system, so they receive poor information about joints and skin", explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in cushioned furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem anymore, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico".
You don't have to be an NHL player to appreciate the viscoelastic anymore.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to its body heat.
Nothing presses; at night, it won't turn like after a hard match.
It just makes him sleep better.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman who is about 180 cm tall will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
For single rooms, for example single rooms, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when you lie on your face, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk toward your elbows", advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert at Cechu čalouníků a dekoratérů, who has been working for many years on the problem of healthy sleep and furniture ergonomics, a subject she teaches in specialized schools.
In double rooms, each needs its own mattress and dressing room, so when buying, you have to be careful to match the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, the so-swimming will have to be mounted at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, models with a minimum of 15 cm of dwelling interior, of which at least three centimetres are for the layer that adapts to shapes and smoothness.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you sit on the mattress, you should definitely not notice the docks", warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of dressing.
The fully padded bedrooms, where the mattress and base are like Siamese, have no meaning in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and cannot be washed, which is often done today.
And since we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat every night, it's clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will start to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, experts reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
But everything has a but.
That is why sellers advise: On mattresses that are 120 or 140 cm wide, carefully clean and wash the cover, but add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress cases are currently made with a cremator closure all around their perimeter, when they are opened they are left in two parts (something very important for the washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling on larger models (and by one person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a napkin, do you have a firm table?
I never did!
At most for the beds designed to keep the visitors overnight.
However, it should make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes in the table and should be used with a mattress with docks inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the docks in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulating sheet mattresses containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fibre) may be used, although a mattress with a higher number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the lumbar area sheets are reinforced and its stiffness can be adjusted is always preferable.
Joint sheet sockets should not be used with a spring mattress, as they do not react to reclination.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixture on the sheets that allows the sheets to be pressed or even tilted so that they "ride" perfectly around the shoulders during sleep.
For men with very broad shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by mattress manufacturers who, in the "male" class, began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember the women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For more demanding customers, cross-structured or multi-turned cushioning table suits are available.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the right mattress and dressing, if you use a bad pillow (large and "mullided"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must support the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the same can relax.
The recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, which is normal in Scandinavia, for example.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder-reinforced somier or the softer area of the mattress) as the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses seem to have something to do with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
The petroleum-based raw materials used to make polyurethane foam are filled with natural oils, such as castor oil or soybeans.
In fact, almost all known manufacturers use soy.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the centre is made exclusively of natural materials", explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh scent into the forest or lavender.
There are also differences between men and women.
While men "cool themselves" with breeze vegetable extracts, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "heat" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel warmer.
Favorites at the moment?
Collars made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam rigidities makes it possible to make mattresses from different areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good-quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT rate, since they are considered to be healthcare.
The first to obtain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's hard to save on mattresses and napkins.
Sometimes offers from manufacturers or sellers can be approved, sometimes offering two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is free.
The age of viscoelasticity with an open cellular structure and a high density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
It originally came about as NASA material, because during takeoffs, astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
The human body, therefore, when warm, exerts a perfect effect and adapts its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal for preventing sores, but also for improving sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses but also for health products, for example pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
For example, domestic manufacturers use Eucatherm C foam or Twinsaver and the like.
More and more parents are using people tracking devices to monitor their children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about GPS monitoring.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also track people's movements and contribute to the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device is roughly the size of a mattress box, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were frightened by the missing Anička case and began to be informed about the available means to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading their privacy.
"We all try to tell ourselves that it is not a spy, but another means to reduce the chances of a tragedy", says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that in certain cases such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases".
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons", adds Pilin.
In his opinion, children should always know what the "coffin" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns that if the child does not want to take it, he will simply throw it away.
"Even the youngest children show great creativity when they deliberately lose certain things if they want to avoid being controlled".
"Previously, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device", says Bočková.
In his opinion, it is debatable whether such a device is actually useful in the event of an attack.
"If it's a prepared kidnapping, the perpetrator will almost always check whether the child carries some sort of electronic device that can reveal their location".
"Now it's the phone".
"As the use of tracking devices expands, you will also look for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be done with a lot of publicity".
"In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the event of an improvised attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if the tracking device is destroyed immediately after an attack, its presence can be helpful.
"The device can be configured to regularly send the position after a certain period".
"If damaged, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person concerned".
"The most expensive devices have an integrated tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and stays still, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question", says Čech.
In their view, such a service can be obtained even with navigated smartphones, where only special software must be installed.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they are currently devices with a size similar to a mattress box or smaller mobile phones.
So you can get lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for that reason, tests are currently being conducted with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device".
"Or it will identify him after a certain time, which can buy the police time", he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will still use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position verification with a GPS system (used in the usual car navigation) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough mecha to surround the whole of the Czech Republic.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mecha to light explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of mecha to its arsenal.
So they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is, the life of the mecha is two years, four years at most.
The army bought the explosive device from STV Group, a.s. for 40 million crowns.
General's staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometers of mecha a year.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnics, with whom MF DNES was in contact, it is decided that, in such a case, they should perform such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year as well as all generals, high-ranking officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want exemptions, neither did Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondr nor army captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could the army be justified in spending 60 kilometres of machete.
That's the length of 25,000 explosions.
Even if it were, the army would have enough supplies for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of mesh, the army would have with the new purchase (even by adding the consumption of engineers or special units) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained recently to Minister Vondra because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so they limit even the practice of shooting for money.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also cannot understand that we are repeatedly bought such quantities of mecha".
"But it's their decision and they'll certainly know why they act like this".
"For us, the army is a good customer that we as a company try to satisfy", admits Jan Děcký, commercial director of STV Group.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometres of mecha by saying he will also have stockpiles of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of STV Group indicates that the mesh has a shelf life of only four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four", says one soldier who, because of possible criticism from the army, refuses to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require an additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of mecha, he got a discount.
"We were 60 percent less than last year's order of 244 kilometers", says the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence's shopping centre Pejšek.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of mecha by police firearms, which remove World War II ammunition or the ammunition left behind by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only for the right amount to deplete the ammunition before its useful life ends.
They decided to do this for safety reasons for the pyrotechnics and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of mecha can be obtained.
The Ministry is already having clear difficulties finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics MF DNES spoke to, after a couple of years the following problem with the current one will occur: it will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old mecha, which is now being bought "cheap".
I still live on the contacts I got from the contest.
The fact that he won the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition, the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec won the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition.
His success story seems to be taken from a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that Liberec needed quality and affordable accommodation.
With the savings he collected from seasonal jobs abroad and a bank loan he bought a half-ruined five-story house.
Considering he was still in his third year of college, he was really brave.
"Today, the quality-price ratio of accommodation in our area has moved me to do something about it", says Lukáš Pytloun.
He started renting the first rebuilt floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned he re-invested in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room boarding house.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he gradually managed to open in Liberec four boarding houses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year it opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tise, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise", said the number one businessman last year.
"This sale of hotel opening licenses was greatly helped by the fact that we won the 'Entrepreneur of the Year' competition", adds Pytloun.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often, and I must say, I was very nice", he recalls.
I would certainly recommend anyone who wants to try out a company that participates in the contest.
But he feels that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he still lives off contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have gotten.
"I've started to collaborate regularly with some people I met through the contest".
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in employees,
In total, about seventy.
"I've seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to be involved in something that has gained general recognition".
"It is not, much less, my own personal success, but the result of the hard work of the whole team".
"Only my name is on the front page", says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a calmer year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, Farmet may have already gone through the worst.
The owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, received the first prize at the last edition of Vodafone's "Company of the Year" competition, last year at the Prague "Slavic House".
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence in fighting the competition", says last year's winner.
The history of Farmet started with the desire to do something useful.
So when the State offered Karel Žďárský's father the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the blockade of property during the communist era, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position at the company where he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest automated printing press manufacturer in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers start to consider the Farmet brand considerably better, but foreign partners also started to value the collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country", says Karel Žďárský.
Last year's Farmet may not have been just a taste of the euphoria of victory.
It also gained recognition for trade performance up to 2008 and partly 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the hardest year for selling machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to halt their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, of course, are not getting out of that situation either".
"Revenue fell by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs", explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company sometimes has to take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and kept the company profits even at lower levels than before the crisis.
After all, where Farmet didn't cut spending was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened our presence on the international market and obtained excellent ratings at national fairs", says Žďárský.
All indications are that they've already left the crisis behind.
Income is rising again and with it, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere", says Karel Žďárský.
A survey that uncovers ridiculous standards
The Absurdity of the Year poll is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
You've already gotten rid of some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring documents to the administration that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than a third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested an extract from the trade register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse moves.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
'The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer request an extract from the commercial register when it checks the insured's taxes,' said Jana Buraňová, spokeswoman for the ČSSZ.
The aim of the Absurdity survey of the year is to examine the rules and regulations that businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year it is part of the Hospodářské noviny business tournament for the fourth time and is also starting to attract the general public.
While last year's edition had three thousand voters, this year it almost reached four thousand.
And it's not surprising, since we still have a lot of legal obligations that need to be respected just to trade.
"Perhaps we are world number one in the number of documents needed for tax returns", says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared with the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, in terms of the conditions for owning a company, the Czech Republic is in 74th position, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first held in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can point to some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the competition closes.
Proposals can be submitted on the website www.firmaroku.cz. After that, the organizer of the contest selects seven candidates for the "pre-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote online via www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The one who gets the most votes wins the absurdity.
This year's survey included more than 100 proposals, including 105 nonsensical rules and regulations.
The examples were sent by both businessmen and professional associations and journalists.
Among the finalists of the competition was, for example, the requirement that road and highway maintenance vehicles pay the toll or that employers with 20 employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of 70 proposals for this year is published on the page of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held in early November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which political and social figures usually participate.
This year, for example, the contest was attended by Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continually imposes barriers on entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year at least thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade", announced Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not in vain.
In 2007, the most annoying thing was the obligation of the businessman to communicate three days in advance to the business office in the permanent operation area, the intention to take a job to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was abolished in the new industrial law.
The obligation which came second in votes in 2007, namely the communication to the work office by their foreign workers of up to 30 days' work trips, was eliminated in the so-called green card law.
And the third is defeated.
The 2009 Absurdity was the regulation for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales in their office.
That is why this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognises socially responsible enterprises
Environmental, humanitarian, educational and sport projects are evaluated.
The fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competition is a new category, the responsible company of 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair enterprises.
"We thus want to support companies that are concerned with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities", says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of Vodafone, the organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebelde of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's main competition of Vodafone Empresa 2010, companies were submitted for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write a standalone article.
Although the type of activities varies widely between the two, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, for example, it is the disabled, in others, it is the personal or health problems of the employees.
Among the 14 finalists from across the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in various sports tournaments.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main donor of funds for disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, a paper mill is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, who make up more than 70% of the workforce.
In Olomouc he won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the weekly average of 35 hours, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it purchases primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the least possible impact on the environment", explains entrepreneur Miluše Ryznarová.
The company responsible for IT Enlogit in the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them a chair and ergonomic keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"We also support the Persona in difficulty scholarship, which helps the local Roma community", says Ondřej Suchý, a company representative.
The company also has a good position, namely the Praní a čištění laundry company in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive special bonuses that affect their pension funds.
"We provide benefits in food, transport, skills improvement and leisure", says Josef Strapáč, of the Bruntál Czasch construction company, a winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category of responsible company of the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Empresa contest of the year who answered the questions on the registration form and sent it to the organizers before 15 August were automatically nominated.
The organisers removed from the evaluation forms that were incomplete or incorrect.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the responsible company of the year competition, but they are not disqualified from the 'main' Vodafone company of the year competition".
"Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the main Enterprise competition of the year", explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Farm Fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police have made several arrests in the Farm Fund building in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media businessman and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It appears that the Commission is attempting to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the refund of the rights in such a way that the auctioned land is given to a specific interested party.
He was to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for it.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribe during a public auction and public tender", said Pilsen's chief prosecutor Antonie Zelená, adding that for the moment she cannot disclose further details about the ongoing investigation.
Twenty-four hours later, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
How he might have influenced the public auction, given the little official information, is only speculative.
Agricultural Fund spokeswoman Lubomíra Černá answered Právo's questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen's headquarters and it was during a public auction.
"This is a client, not one of our workers", he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called 'Call for the submission of proposals for the transfer of land in accordance with the Land Act' and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a value higher than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced".
"The order of the buyers is determined by the bids and the land is transferred by the Agricultural Fund to the person who offers the highest bid", the Fund spokeswoman explained.
Luboš G. had information on who was to be invited and, since he was also an interested person because he had acquired various restitution rights, proposed to the interested parties in the land that he would not participate in the auction.
For that, he was charging a commission.
That would explain why, at the time of his arrest, he had so much money on him.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for some time.
It was in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular on the site where a major road to the Borská pole industrial area should be built.
Then he exchanged them very profitably with the magistrate for a house in the very historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because otherwise, the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay an extra charge of several hundred crowns a month
From January, households will have to pay not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rent.
As a result, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns a month from their wallets from January onwards.
Electricity prices rise by 4.6%, gas by about 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 crowns more per year than it is now.
However, the main electricity suppliers lowered prices as support for renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaic, increased.
However, gas is only moderately expensive, especially when heating is used more and consumption is therefore higher.
In this case, they should also have a couple hundred more crowns a year.
As electricity and gas are increasingly expensive across the country, the price change for central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January onwards about 50 crowns a month for central heating, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 crowns a year.
Prague residents will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent does not change, the Pragueers will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the whole country.
In Northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will be higher by 7.4%.
They can increase the rental prices of 450,000 rented apartments in Prague considerably, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, will increase the rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take to court those who disagree with the new lease.
The regulated rents, which benefit residents of around 300,000 apartments, could rise by up to 10% next year.
The young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum.
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of 15 to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is based on the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is out of fashion, because it takes too long to get drunk".
"Now the trend is strong alcoholic beverages", says Luděk Pelikán, head of pediatrics at Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia.
"When you manage to get a bottle of your father's alacena, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka".
"Wodka has the advantage of being lighter with juice and not smelling so bad", she explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokeswoman of Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum".
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, especially among schoolchildren".
"In some cases, they use watermelon that they took home", adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, it's 13 and 14-year-old drinkers who usually show up in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where she has been working since this year, she worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times".
"It started at the age of 12, when she was brought in with 3.5 alcohols in her blood, plus a blend of ecstasy", says the department doctor on this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party".
"The interesting thing is that his mother was not surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours", the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest in alcohol by parents or even their clear tolerance of alcohol by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that in the case of children, dependency cannot be properly discussed.
"An alcoholic is defined as a person who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children".
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is more because of a systematically failed social or family environment", explains chief Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman Jurinová, this year, forty drunk children were hospitalized in the Motol pediatric clinic until mid-November.
However, statistics only show those who come with a serious poisoning and should stay in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after a walking medical examination, go home to their parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink water, there are three seasonal ups and downs for Pelikán: Witch Day, End of Year and end of school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for the bad grades or, conversely, celebrate the beginning of the holiday".
"On Witches' Day I have seen up to seven children drunk at a time", Pelikán adds.
Drunken people who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the body.
"These guys are doing much better because after a busy night, they get up well and they don't hurt".
"They only show confusion about where they are", Pelikán notes, adding that patients often lose their good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
The cost of an ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients is tens of thousands of crowns.
"I have often used cost as a means of educating them, when on visiting I tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a youth job in order for you to earn enough to pay that night", Pelikán adds.
Health insurance, in your opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually pays back to people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159s are in private hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159s out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced with the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed Tuesday for Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It's the first time such a device has ever been in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
At the time, they were only abroad for practice or demonstration flights.
It is the two-seater version L-159T1, which until now was used by the Czech army and was still in flight condition.
The remaining three planes are the L-159 single-seaters.
These are still held at Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, Omnipol, took over them last week.
Jan Peješk, from the defense press department, says it's not yet known when the planes will physically withdraw from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seaters, on the other hand, were separated from the repaired aircraft a long time ago, without any additional investment or contribution from the Ministry".
"The two-seater L-159T1 was exchanged in its current state", he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army is not running out of two-seat aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new planes was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to adding aircraft to the equipment of some Allied countries.
'The contract clearly states that EADS is the company that will withdraw the L-159 aircraft and that they will be used for the piloting practices of NATO countries.'
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this context", Pejšek points out.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published ahead of time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense management claims that the exchange promotes future L-159 export abroad.
The Czech army has acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes could potentially have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already complained to the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice that it should choose the aircraft by conducting a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last should arrive at Prague's Kbely airport in fourteen days.
A finger longer than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men with a longer than annular index are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the startling conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British cancer journal.
They could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger may be a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men up to 60 years of age", said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could therefore help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly if this trait is associated with genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger of their right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They had the same odds of getting prostate cancer as 19 percent of those with fingers of the same length.
For men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The ratio of the lengths of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows about the study, but he does not think the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "fully demonstrated".
Czech Republic in snow: D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, was snow-covered Thursday.
Roads and sidewalks are mostly covered in compact snow and the snow removal machines circled throughout the night through numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road between the 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov was closed due to several industrial and passenger car accidents, as was the D1 road in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Ústředního automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
In the 91 kilometre a truck crashed, in the 93 they collided two industrial vehicles that caused injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the trench.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers must travel slowly behind Brno at kilometre 190 or through Brno and enter kilometre 182 at Kývalce.
There have been several kilometers of traffic jams.
There's also been an accident on the D11 road, just outside Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow several centimeters high and thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Traffic congestion is forming in Prosek, for example, although Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, another state of emergency will be declared in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and airports.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně airport was closed from 11pm on Wednesday until 5am.
Currently, most roads in southern Moravia can be used, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brněnska snow tongues are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the worst affected places was Vyškovsko.
The Rousínov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kučerov and also Šaratice-Milešovice connections are closed.
They'll need milling machines to clean them up.
At the moment, it is not possible to say when they will be opened to traffic.
In Hodoninsk, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region, which, as a protected natural area, must simply be left in a state of inertness, accumulate up to five centimetres of snow, according to ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimetres of snow fell, and in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall is gradually returning to the Czech Republic.
The American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The US military is deploying a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known for now only by the code name XM-25.
The generals hope the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the game's progress" toward their victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol with an extremely precise aiming.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains causes it to actually function like a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Of course, normal protection cannot be used and, when it throws its killer rain of metallic flakes, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point their laser beam at it, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and squeezes the trigger".
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters".
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two, or three meters", notes Audette.
400 jobs are being moved
The Fujitsu consortium is moving its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu is moving its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant in the computer and maintenance sector announced Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, 100 more employees of the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will stay there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favour the way employees work.
Besides, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner stated, "in Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday brought joy among those in favour and disappointment among those against.
The head of the Frankfurt economy section, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this has earned him a "Global Player".
This is a "magnificent location recognition".
Fujitsu is settled in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) is complaining about Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the city of their intention.
"We have naturally offered our help to the company", Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts between the computer manufacturer and the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons brought about the fall.
So, there's now a big empty place to cover at the famous post.
"I hope the building owner and the landlord will cooperate".
The building formerly used by Fujitsu on Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of a controversial construction project for the seaside city along with the remaining buildings on Marienbader Platz for ten years.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the city hall a new entrance to the city is formed, which is in charge of the criticism regarding the massive building that previously used the spaces as parking spaces and regarding the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment advisory and valuation companies, the software manufacturer for booking systems, Start Amadeus, were installed, as well as Siemens's merger with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu consortium is recognized as the world's third largest IT provider.
It has enterprises, for example computers and servers, and provides precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is located from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries here will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name TDS.
That's why they've rented 7,000 square feet of Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the 1920s, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central association of electronics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels the server - Threats against Assange
Anger is taking over WikiLeaks more and more.
The internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind it is political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is apparently being held in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former US server and are currently looking for a home internet in Europe.
Well-known US Senator Joe Lieberman calls on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, should remain in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from Amazon's server".
"Speak freely in the land of freedom", activists for the revelations reported via the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company Amazon had deleted the WikiLeaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had turned to the Amazon services website for secret diplomatic documents to deal with the high numbers of documents being accessed.
On Twitter, WikiLeaks explained the following: "Perfectly, we will spend our dollars hiring people in Europe".
If Amazon has problems with free speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman requested investigations, CNN reported on a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I had wished Amazon to take these measures earlier, before the previous releases of classified information through WikiLeaks", the senator stated.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and reckless process puts our national security at stake and threatens life around the world", the independent senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks with its service to spread stolen material.
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently called the investigation in Sweden a plot by his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange".
That's why he fears for Assange's safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of WikiLeaks remains unknown.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to the statements made by North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has claimed that the person responsible for WikiLeaks revelations should be tried for treason and should be executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
There's a big dispute between the White House and Assange.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had asked for the Secretary of State's resignation, in case she was responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website", Gibbs declared.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website".
The US government has to prove the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Center Against Terrorism, was named special agent, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms" that are necessary in light of the WikiLeaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change all information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the US government announced that to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists, they must endanger the publication of WikiLeaks.
"We have done everything we can to contact them", State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary".
The College of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream is prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream makers has the highest influx of visitors from around the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
From the fridge and the fridge.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream making.
The ice cream maker takes the ice cream off the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the barrel and sells it.
To know this, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream college with the freezer in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream makers has the highest influx of visitors from around the world.
There are also more special courses on chocolate ice cream and home-based ice cream practices.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires on the soft ice.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries on every continent, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, a California art teacher, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years in an exciting job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Master ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari later explained to the participants the ideal qualities of perfect ice cream.
Not only is its good taste decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training or the cream deck of the national upper house and mainly the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why every ball has something romantic".
The first step to preparation seems very easy.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients - milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar, and stabilizers - in a large grinder, which heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and at the moment cools it down to four degrees.
Then he opens the machine tap and a white, pasteurized base cream comes out, the basis for all kinds of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made with only natural elements or without a stabilizer?
How can one let go of some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that you turn away from the trends of the time.
The person who speaks of ice cream "not just natural ingredients", may have used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar beans.
Of course, you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, you just have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a sounding granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
They use scents.
As for the taste of ice cream, Master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
Plus, there's powder and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to put flavored ingredients in their merchandise".
"But you must experience it sometime".
Either with fruit syrups with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the basic white dough ice cream, which with eggs will turn into a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the course participants can use the freezers.
Luciano allows them to make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, moca and hazelnuts, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They're doing the same experiment with fruit ice cream.
Better taste does not necessarily depend on more tofu or more fruit purée.
Hazelnut ice cream does not need to taste like nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group makes the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the flavor of the ice cream, Luciano says.
The preparation of ice cream is a problem of arithmetic: peach purée is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar ratio of the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream needs an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano takes out a tool with which he fixes the amount of sugar in the types of fruit (wine grower measurement for Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make it easier to count.
Making ice cream requires only physical application, as before.
Not only does the tool help to automate the basic mass.
There is also a tool in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously batted and cooled to a temperature below zero.
After all, all automation is left out as far as the little pasta goes.
Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his teammates from top to bottom with fruit purée, like a mini-first giant without control.
"In all courses", says Master Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens".
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry experimenting with GMOs.
This issue is currently being discussed by the Testbiotech expert group, which considers itself an institute for independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well", Testbiotech director Christoph Then said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, director of Efsa's expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been employed for years in the Ilsi association.
Consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer are costing it.
Kuiper has significantly collaborated on Efsa's testing standards for genetically modified plants, placing him in a clear conflict of interest, then criticizes.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of Ilsi's situation and imitate the company's writing, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a conflict of interest.
So recently, a senior manager at Efsa went without support or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed sides with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, made by the Environmental Directorate-General and an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some from the industry, are used, provided they are of high technical quality, and are ordered in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have no contact with industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without Lobby's mandate.
In this regard, independent experts such as Then criticize the fact that GM plants are currently allowed without research into animal food and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not proven.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize does in agriculture", says Then.
The current practice is to check only isolated proteins but not the entire GM plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for risks, how are you going to find them?" asks the accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That's why there are few scientists who aren't influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not usually published.
"The industry controls the security investigation", Hilbeck maintains.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has gotten some, about 400 pounds in total.
On Monday, I was outside Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind me.
There were demonstrations
It was snowing.
The story is well known: In September, the excavators arrived and began to knock down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands marched against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing became rubble.
It breaks into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough, soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he's 43.
He's secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics".
"They must not disappear".
He enthuses himself: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural".
Like he said once, he smelled cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The Stuttgart stone trail leads to a forest in Tubingen in an earlier French Navy munitions depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything that came from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be dishonorable, they would grind the gravy or send it to the garbage dump", says a wooden house that was once a guardhouse in his office.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the downing company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained that there was absolutely nothing he could do about the shooting.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram mazizo cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Garden owner, landscaper, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of momentum has long since become the "wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special", says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component".
He climbs up his terrain, takes a tour of his vast 20-acre kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, became interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a rock lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the biggest antique stone dealer in the country.
- What?
In the snow there are artistic sandstone stones.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke Bridge", he explains.
A hot, yellow, hot, hot cup, he's excited.
"My dear stone".
The road crosses the forest.
It points a lot: red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And keep going.
"Beautiful travertine".
The mazizos formerly belonged to the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the church of Sankt Blasien, tuff from the hospital of Heilbronner.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple tool and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed".
He hasn't gotten rich, not at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people said they were making the stone tradesman, and a stonemason, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying", says the man who takes care of the remains.
He's about to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be rescued.
Talent struggle around great potential
There's an active influx at the buffet.
16 students gather around the buns, the tomato soup and the candy.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with the workers at VW and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivalry and in the same way, many companies, like VW, come together in a face-to-face fight around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Its mission: to recruit the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And because universities don't publish on their students' skills, they try to instill exceptional talent into practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium wins the talents.
A lady in the personnel department handing out pens, handcuffs and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the enthusiastic young talents the internship programmes and jobs for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is running the project with VW.
See advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience".
"In turn, VW can get to know the students, observe interesting candidates more closely and consider them as potential future workers".
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
"The main point was previously in technical projects", says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not, they have to advertise and, above all, to get a highly skilled workforce.
All students of engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Engineering Association (VDI), 40,000 engineer jobs were vacant in October.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this engineer gap will grow even further.
At the auditing and consulting firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a modern type of racetrack, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG's subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It's decided who should go in two rounds of selection at the exit.
Only the cream of the cream of many participants goes to the US.
Universities are increasingly striving to pick and polish the high potential of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd".
"The simple journey alone was short".
For the Dykta scouts, the grades are good.
"To date we have had a similar action in the last year with all participants".
"Some are near the end, and they want to apply to work with us", he says.
In addition to the direct approach to the campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their job fairs.
"We're trying to get students at the specialized fairs".
"Something about Intersolar", says Sitha Stübe, staff manager for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, there are 35 vacancies on the company's website.
"It's getting very difficult to fill vacancies".
"It costs a lot of time and money", he says.
A shortcut is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher education institutions, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Professors advise that you can do internships with us or do your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium usually cannot offer it", says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The factors that determine are flexible working hours, childcare or good chances of promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld is ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
It asks the employee how satisfied he is with the job and the environment and observes the employees' previous conditions.
Stübe, the staff manager, also expects extra points in her ranking for her job aspirants.
"I think the applicant is especially focused on the external ratings of a potential employer", he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to gain a good reputation as employers.
Advise your clients more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves", he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called internal Employer Branding, also promotion of corporate identity within the own staff.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors".
When people are treated well and identified with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer from friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a game with a gang", Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a forceful ban and thereby irrevocably cancelled its previous plans.
New drilling operations are also being carried out on the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What prompted this strict ban, which will be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April.
Before the disaster that killed 11 workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama had admitted to new drilling in the western Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to reduce U.S. dependence on new foreign oil supplies.
To date, it has not been entirely clear who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
An Obama commission of inquiry will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium following the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by employing tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
The responsible control authority, which has been accused of corruption and has fallen into disrepute, is now reforming itself.
Obama announced in parallel that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry is publicly announcing that total mining in the Gulf will be reduced thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"Government plans are the biggest deterrent to the growth of the oil and gas industries", says the result of the current survey by consulting firm BDO - ahead of Wednesday's extraction ban.
The American Energey Alliance complains about the insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation".
Investments in new extraction projects are being prolonged for a while, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water in the rivers is oil marbled, smells like a gas station: Millions of litres of oil spilled have destroyed nature in Nigeria's Ogoniland.
People live off the theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari seems to like it.
"Don't get tired", the environmental activist reassures the journalists: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes".
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys waving in the water to their chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
You can't see brown oil spots floating on the surface.
Before, I used to fist-fist shrimp here, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was spilled into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
Fish from the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the world's most stinking regions.
On the way down the river through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine removes a brown broth, which, if you dip your hand in the water, will pull out a few oil-filled ones.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the colliding palm trees and hanging their palms.
In vain are flocks of birds searched, as if they were in the wetland as always: as soon as the outside barrier is silent, a kind of ghostly calm from an earlier paradise with the smell of a gas station spreads out in it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle", says Celestine Akpobari, a hurricane.
The war comparison proceeds.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battleground for years: Here the first European explorers broke in over 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here the Shell consortium had to put its first factory in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil workers.
Even today, companies are prohibited from returning to Ogoniland: While they pumped more than two million barrels of black gold daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred yards, steel platforms emerged as strange water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called out to the drill heads.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
Every moment a head fails, Akpobari thinks, then a steady stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres have been spilled over 50 years into the delta ecosystem: Year after year, oil is pouring in, as in the shipwreck of the Exxon Valdez 21 years ago in the Alaskan Sea, one of the greatest ecological disasters in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see breaking heads and leaky pipes as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell primarily applies low safety standards, usually the world's standard ones, scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only the failure rates of pipes are "about a multiple higher than elsewhere".
In a place that seems forgotten from afar, a workshop full of oil appears under the open sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: they are naked and covered with oil.
Among the many barrels, sometimes attached to the drilling rigs, sometimes arbitrarily spread over the ground, a fire burned: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil is heated in the fire for hours, explains Michael, the group's head.
First, gasoline enters the tank through pipes, then the oil pipe drips, and finally diesel is released.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 litres of diesel a day: "It brings us 34,000 naira", about $22 a day.
The people of the delta take advantage of the fuel shortage in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel at just 40 euros-cents a litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: they thus reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", which have been hacking the pipeline network that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this step at least 16 million litres of oil per day is lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly illegally refined: Organized crime networks, which also include politicians and high military officials, store the best part in aljibs and sell it cheaply on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate about whether the environmental catastrophe is due to population management or to the lax mode of production purely academic.
"If oil companies hadn't behaved like invaders and completely destroyed the fish's natural habitat, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries".
While the conditions of the Ogoni are mostly shattered by Shell to the point that only one deduction from the consortium appears: "Maybe it's better to present another nationality, like China".
Michael gets all nervous about it.
"It's about time you disappeared", says the muscular Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come any minute".
If the army's special unit catches the illegal refiners, it doesn't threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to make use of the raw material.
"This damned invention has completely shattered our country", Akpobari says.
Investigators detect dangerous factory defects in the A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a major security problem.
In a study of a machine that made a forced landing, researchers found a possible factory defect, which can result in "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas Airlines wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than you might imagine: Australian air safety authorities have detected a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s through their investigations and warn of a possible factory failure.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic engine failure".
This affected engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus which had to make a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline is launching legal proceedings against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in federal court in Sydney that allowed for more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, Qantas's chief executive, stated that his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
The engine's brand has lost parts and its wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will conduct more safety testing on the super-humbues equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesman for ATSB.
The safety issue has become important enough to inform everyone concerned.
After the Qantas aircraft's emergency landing, the airline kept its A380 fleet grounded for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily kept approximately three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa has re-engineered an A380 as a precaution.
This double deck aircraft is the world's largest passenger aircraft.
A Nevada across the country is causing traffic chaos
Germany is totally white: Overnight snow has fallen on almost the entire country.
Many streets are in chaos, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter ice in Germany: Almost all of the country experienced freezing temperatures on Thursday night, triggering traffic chaos in many places.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a 15-centimeter-thick snow layer.
Traffic is very limited on most motorways and on many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, snow removal is in continuous operation, removing new snow again and again, but it's not ready.
In addition, strong winds sweep the Baltic coast.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects high tides with water levels 1.2 metres above normal level on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There are partly 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold, strong winds are responsible for rolling it.
Many trucks and cars got stuck there overnight.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disruptions are expected in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, trees falling over the lanes or the broken chain and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the interurban service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia, an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and rescue services provided wool blankets, food and drink to the 165 passengers on board.
Snow winds sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snow-storm winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman, there are already 40 cancelled flights.
The snowmobiles are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
On many streets, Wednesday afternoon, there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a road junction in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg because of the snow-covered streets: Here too a truck was hit at a road junction because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
A 30-year-old woman also died after her car overturned a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be getting softer and dusty and will therefore swirl into soft streaks.
But the wind will slow down.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong, fast winds.
It will undoubtedly still be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers in its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could add up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank has repaired its headquarters: The twin towers in the Frankfurt bank district were modernized; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of the re-investment, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland claims based on a spokesman.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the proposed sale.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then rent them back", he said.
The largest credit institution in Germany therefore resigns its head office after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements for it.
Energy reforms amounted to approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would be a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area estimate the value of the newspaper towers known as "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed at this time, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourning the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who claimed to have died after many mine explosions.
The bodies have not yet been found, as security measures remain precarious in the scene of the accident.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced into the scene of the accident, but it found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment was able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts concluded that there was no chance the miners had survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Today, family and friends commemorate the deceased with a memorial.
Ten thousand people have been changed by the glowing sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
Keep quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, under clothing and surfboards.
Flags waved halfway in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth", New Zealand government president John Key told participants of the memorial.
"But they never came home".
You can't accept your son's death until you've seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the memorial.
In the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners were also buried.
Rescue workers started extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
As soon as the explosive gases have been removed, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warrior!
Does gore fit in with art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is once again exploring the boundaries of the genre with his epic battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience would Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have been thinking of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A single-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and murders his enemies with almost superhuman fights, sounds ideal for young viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and rip his enemies' guts out of their bodies alive when he's in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as he is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters are carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of painful death cries.
Otherwise, they quietly enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous scenery of Scotland, which the backdrops offer the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for mature filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has multiple target groups it's a shame they can't dismiss each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his wild and the trilogy about the hairy drug dealer "Pusher" to be a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with anything more humor in the mainstream or anything less of the brutality of the art house.
A brain mass and a bursting gut can't deter most art film fans.
Most action fans are bored if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a force of violent Christian missionaries for understandable reasons and gets stuck for an eternity in the calm and fog before his team reaches America and is quieted back there.
It's a shame that "Walhalla Rising" didn't find a movie distributor in Germany and it's only released on DVD.
It's a disaster against the magnificent images, but also because behind the presumptuous and bloody façade, there's a sometimes exciting piece of film that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, it's all atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into a movie.
And that's why there's no escape for the viewers.
Refn is barely a moment's relaxation and his icy images and the grim trance soundtrack make a knot in his throat, especially the incredible hatred, which from the characters' hearts goes towards him.
Only a little blond young man, who supports Unojo faithfully, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any moment a warrior out of hell for temporary enemies and allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It represents doom, but maybe only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mystery film that can be hated and admired, to anger, upset and surprised.
It was an experience.
Mysterious earthquakes
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
At midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that rises from the river.
According to information from the CIA's US International Intelligence Service from late April 2008, a current reactor is being designed under the name of the nearby El-Kibar, very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
The technical aspects of the use of the technology are not as important as those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from inside.
The reactor had been in operation for a short time, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it's barely known more than then, the puzzles grew bigger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was fully confident that the Syrians had built a reactor in al-Kibar, but that he barely saw any indication that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several intelligence agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible".
They lack solid evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of it, a senior UN diplomat responded in a rousing way that the IAEA has "enough material to have questions".
The Syrians quickly cleared the debris of the alleged "useless military building" and deliberately raided the ground.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in the Kibar, which had been man-made.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, of commercial vendors in the moments immediately following the attack, which must have a higher information value than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not go on the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always implied that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as unlikely after particle analysis.
Since then Damaskus has refused to discuss it, as has the satellite imagery.
In addition, the controllers are banned from a second inspection in el-Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel is also strictly silent.
"We will never comment", Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "is gradually becoming a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat is assigned a seat at the IAEA in Vienna, a serious breach of the IAEA's nuclear non-proliferation treaty is finally pending.
The IAEA considers three more equipment as key to progress in the enlightenment, which must be "on a functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not publicly disclosed until now what equipment they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they appear to be suspicious.
According to the Süddeutschen Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as internals, again derived from the proximity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these sites and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite imagery, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located on or immediately next to a military base, Syria therefore bans entry to all three sites to the IAEA.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the US has requested from the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment thanks to the U.S. Secret Service's warnings.
The IAEA has satellite imagery showing evidence of material moving between the three sites and the Euphrates river.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production".
But there is "no sign of any sensitive activities", nor of uranium enrichment or reconditioning - processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by unenriched uranium.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should be separated for bombs afterwards, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt that the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are in all three places.
Since hundreds of cargo trucks have disappeared from the ground, no one has any information about where the debris remains.
The OIEW considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometres from the Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, unlikely, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as a zone for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the images from orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three allegedly suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it hardly helps dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months developing an inspection plan there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the extent of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damaskus is also critical of this proposal.
The Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a kind of US ambassador, has been outraged by the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who is supposed to propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but he still hesitates.
This path is very risky: it takes a majority of the IAEA governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious about an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected, "What if they find nothing?"
Love in times of war
There's been trouble since Angelina Jolie started this summer with the direction of her yet-to-be-named debut.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much else is known about it, but this is enough for the agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's associations have quickly protested, which at the last minute moved some of the planned filming days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims Organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, Jolie is the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ambassador, she told a Bosnian newspaper.
She's not a diplomat, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's stance on this informs the victims well enough about the script.
Her organization in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended dismissing Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly has Jolie written for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which read the script, granted a tape and loosened a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie didn't go after all.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she is very hard pressed to enter the Yugoslav conflict, she wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give voice to all parties involved.
Its contents remain inaccurate.
A second synopsis of the film is circulated on the Internet that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the war started and they meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the "rape victim falls in love with a torturer" variant.
It's certain that Jolie's movie really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on false information".
Now they can make peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script is still online illegally, like many others before.
Nothing as far from here
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish again.
No sign of grief
Instead, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans shout out joyfully as the music reverberates, hitting the ground with their feet.
Bailey club vibrates in southern ireland cork, because players throw, and find, ping-pong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The bizarre show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this weird drinking game and discreet computer actually don't make any good jokes.
And the 26-year-old is trying to have fun with that, distracted by the glaring question of what the future holds.
Fun in Vegas isn't in his plans, and in January he'll be doing a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling", he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there".
At least: his girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "he got the job of his dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign", says the young man, smiling.
Because of the poor outlook at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, her brother Colin is currently working as an IT consultant in London.
The young people leave: There are many families like the Tanners on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, economists and the ESRI Institute for Social Research in Dublin predict.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 migrants.
A big loss for this small country of only 4.5 million people.
The forecasts are confirmed, a migration wave is coming up comparable to that which the island suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great prosperity to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly confusing for young, well-educated Irish people, for whom everything is up to date.
The loss of jobs and the social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everybody needs plenty of money.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times has letters to the director of the migrant mass, complaining that "Everything in Ireland is sinking".
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, goes and loses our country and with it an entire generation".
"The last one to close the door".
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Students' Union sees a bleak future emerge because the government is only devoted to editing and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"They cut the minimum wage, but they have no strategies to get new jobs", says the 20-year-old.
Notice how your classmates go from one unlisted practice to the next.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing".
People like Stephen McLarnon try to look at this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who are starting to work, working abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to directing your career", says the manager.
On their website, they have pictures of a boy surfing in Australia and another boy snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like working in a gallery, but it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
Now they're building a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he's going to Hannover or Berlin for the next project.
O'Donovan only sees his homeland a few times because he works overtime to pay off a loan for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy", he says, since it's been a long time since he first stepped on the threshold of his home.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I've never been better".
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes out for cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with neat gardens in front of the houses, in the entrance are large and expensive cars parked.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was crazy times, easy money without a lot of questions", he says.
Are you afraid of failing credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, serves some more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch".
The civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he hears often these days.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as in past times here on the island", he says.
"Working abroad for a season is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps it makes us feel like Irish for the first time".
He laughs and tells of his father, who in the last great economic crisis left for England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple".
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
To look into the future and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's worked in London for a couple years now, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend be doing well in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that worries him most: his 27th birthday celebration on Friday in Dublin.
I'm afraid I might degenerate into a farewell party.
"Just, not too much emotion", he says, and gives his beer a big sip.
"Despite, it sounds very distressing".
"We'd rather call it a party to walk away, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games".
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America and private enterprises continues to increase.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it is possible to monitor changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year's survey, which was carried out in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively humor that reigns in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the South American Pacific coast (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a 40% drop in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a sharp decline in production last year.
However, only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see graph 2).
Around 44% of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy in practice works in their country, the same figure as last year but considerably higher than the 25% recorded in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% said they trusted their country's Congress and 45% their government, the same as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has remained in place during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and has declined again this year, to 32%.)
However, mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since the polls began, more Latin American respondents cite crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see chart 5).
Some 31% say they or a close relative have been the victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has fallen from 38% last year and is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprises are indispensable for development, compared with only 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelan respondents agree (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (the same figure as 9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the garbage
No one expected the general election held on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went much worse than foreigners feared trying to help the country recover from its problems.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, ballots were thrown in the sewers, electoral colleges destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Electoral colleges opened hours late.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to figure out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the election to be canceled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, stated that it was "a relatively good election in many ways".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The draw is expected to take place in January.
All hope for the elections has not yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition calling for the vote to be void.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has barely any support, if any, has passed the second round.
Considering that the cholera epidemic is sweeping the country and that more than a million of the earthquake survivors are still living in shops, a large abstinence is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they couldn't because of a lack of organization.
Some 250,000 identification documents, necessary for voting, had not yet been distributed shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the election of a legitimate and popular government an essential step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And as has been evident, so do the Haitians themselves.
Moving pointy towards the center
In the weeks since losing her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Despite everything, whether it can turn into a successful campaign for a second term in the elections next year will depend on whether clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at their discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernandez's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened since Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have confronted Ms. Fernández.
However, after a chaotic session in which one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue", the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore be applied for the next year, giving the President even more room to act on its expenditure.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage requirements of the unions, place it at around 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and had the INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernandez now moderate these policies?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit the salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved by a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández is giving signs that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to enter into an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about 6.7 billion dollars.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for national consumption, which seems to be the prelude to the cleanup of INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernandez wants to continue in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of whom are tired of kirchnerism.
When Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the tide of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If she wants to win another election, she'll have to decide whether or not to quietly repudiate many of her husband's policies.
Half a hurry for China
Voters in Taiwan are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible voters, went on November 27 to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a champion of feelings for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but he didn't pass.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to get a majority of the vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has leaned for full independence from Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential elections, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the town halls.
The elections saw the typical elements of Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with flags and lightly dressed girls dancing.
Nor was the mysterious attempted murder of rigor.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The funny thing is, it hasn't been possible to determine whether the man intended to hurt Lien or get revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PPD leader, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicion about the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that this was not the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates spoke of public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
As a result, the KMT usually avoids publicising its links to the government in Beijing.
But this time too the PPD avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It reflects the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, said that his policy towards China had been confirmed to be acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
I am sure you would like to see political integration achieved as well, but the first thing is first.
It's best to wait until the 2012 presidential election for that.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he openly insisted on explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs. Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as the PPD's presidential candidate, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything it can to prove that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans to set up a group of experts to act as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without preconditions.
Mrs. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that PPD candidates would have come out better off if they had insisted Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intercession, the PPD will have difficulty choosing between its possible candidates.
The KMT must also take a conscience test.
Mr Ma's ratings have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be primarily due to unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT says it will restructure its cabinet as well as local teams.
The large sample of the PPD suggests that Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed".
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Artist of Revelation.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the surprises at the Grammys this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Revelation Artist.
Given that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Hope", the nomination is thought provoking, but it respects the Grammys' rules that an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist" must be on the market.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was undoubtedly a breakthrough and, given her light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop, funk and Latin rhythm influences, it is at least possible to distinguish between Spalding and the path to success for Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent to the Grammy voters, who have lately concentrated on the jazz scene for this category.
In the other categories, Grammy voters rightly paid tribute to Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors are veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly".
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans favorite and regular guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest is considerably slanted toward fusion as in Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber's albums.
The wild punk Darcy James Argue's Secret Society earned well-deserved recognition in the big band category, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the always risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in Best Direction of a Classical Album
The classical music nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, in five movements, and Steve Mackey for "Dreamhouse", an eclectic three-movement orchestral work.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
The classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories spanning orchestral, opera, choral and solo albums.
The category of classic producer of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; several artists' "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati"; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" by the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Mariinsky Theatre orchestra and choir; and Arthur Sullivan for "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for him to play on mandolin by Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa", Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the category of orchestral performance, for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the nominated instrumental soloists are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominated vocalists this year are all women: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song".
The proposed mosque in Temecula gets approval from the planning commission
The mosque project for Temecula has received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often heated public testimony.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and traffic jams.
However, the committee members decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha'is, of all religions", said Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud of you".
"It proves that justice prevails".
"The opposition is really minimal", he adds.
"Just speak very loudly".
"There are wonderful people in this valley".
The meeting began at six p.m. and lasted until nearly midnight; most of the time was devoted to people interceding for or against the center, virtually the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"America no longer exists", reads one of the comments.
"It's another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand".
"America has fallen".
The plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Zero Zone, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
Their congregation of about 135 families had been living together smoothly in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a larger, better space than the warehouse they rented from a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy a 4.32 acre site on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the municipal council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers have discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it proves that it is possible that life forms exist without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity".
"It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic".
"That makes it very peculiar, though little is left to be a truly 'alien' life-form", said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appears in the online edition of Thursday's Science.
For a long time, it was thought that there are six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible", said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the find is important for the search for life on different planets than Earth, as researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss the discovery, in which no details were released, generated much speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "does show is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of 'standard' elements we consider indispensable for life may not be as fixed", said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, U.K.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure", Cockell added.
The discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus".
"As a result, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate between them".
"Arsenic is different enough, however, that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it goes in and, in a way, it calms up the biochemical machinery", Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt to and use to grow.
The microbe grows best with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form that uses arsenic could naturally exist, whether in other parts of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that phosphorus could replace arsenic is not new, but no example had ever been found to prove it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth ages, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"It does suggest that there might be other ways to generate life, not just the way life formed on Earth in ancient times", said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The stolen dogs that were missing in Compton have been found.
The two missing dogs from the four stolen were found outside the Bellflower motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's officials said Thursday.
The four race dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, went missing Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express pickup truck they were spending the night in, outside Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found Wednesday late at night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine", Whitmore said.
"They are in good condition".
"They're back with their rightful owners".
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is underway".
"We don't want to say anything", Whitmore said.
"We're following a few clues".
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to make any comments on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis Rickard and Peek were planning to show off at the local dog shows this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing as of Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to show off Trace.
The other dogs were to show off in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the nearly two-month tour that the couple makes by participating in dog competitions.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their bedroom window.
They were carrying three other dogs (a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany), who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick fur and they'd be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van theft Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
It was unclear on Thursday whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the MGM restructuring gets final court approval.
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to clear about $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and television shows.
Thursday's ruling confirms the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles to MGM re-launching under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executives of what will be a reduced studio.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit facility to finance the operations and production of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the loan, which is contributing $75 million on its own, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide advice on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron President and expert in bankruptcy recovery, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial troubles and satisfy the study's 140+ creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion the creditors sought.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal debate and disagreement, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-billion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for their company management services, will receive a $4 million "success fee".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and has assembled an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep their gift budget balanced
While the iPad is the top contender for this year's most wonderful toy, followed, perhaps, by the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with accounts, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see which electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law was working; this year's tech toy will probably have more power, cost the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
Also, while there are usually fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button-powered toys are on the rise, as are rechargeable toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated).
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and older) are toy toys the size of a coward that sing a note when their bellies are tight.
One squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze starts to put together a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing in harmony.
Caution: Once it starts to squeeze, it can't stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and up) is the best choice.
Borrowing from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-based games like Simóm Dice, and can make the moon-step, thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheels with a locking device.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about a lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computerised educational toys.
He's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and up), with a backpack full of question letters designed to turn a drive into a session with an occasional self-correction exercise book.
If you are hesitant to give your child your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60 dollars, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, 3 to 12 years old), it is the first major tweak of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL (90 dollars, ages 3-7) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and ebooks, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and up) is a five-block game barely larger than a mattress box, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to put words together by placing the blocks in line before time runs out; it's formidable for an improvised word-building competition.
It's increasingly toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based on their presence in toy stores alone, the two biggest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you exchange the code online, your child gets enough credit at the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include skateboards on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the pig in its toothbrush, the Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of microrobots powered by button batteries.
The false insect moves quickly over 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find a way out.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of maintaining order in China is promoted
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin set foot in a city square, strictly inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the fat-headed policemen of China's urban order, feared and despised for their capricious, energetic measures and inclination to violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of viewers.
"Signed!"
"Watch out!"
Show them, he whispered, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls who barely spent their teenage years wearing identical white gloves and olive green jackets and tight pants to grab attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with blue and white striped twigs.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance", said Mr. Tang, contemptuously.
"Models are cute".
More than one government has tried to clear the image of China's urban inspectors.
A city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
Guangdong Province changed the grayish green color of the uniforms to a purportedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating looks: In 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a discolored snack cart, and watched him with his frown constantly for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the tough cop a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's minute respect for these squadrons in the city.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat and killed a passerby after he used his cell phone to film them as they dissolved a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and posted online, describing how to effectively flog criminals without bleeding them.
This year, a Shanghai street vendor suffered brain damage after a brawl with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar on the government", lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another tactical controversy.
The newspaper demanded "a really thorough cleanup".
Skeptics say the current approach is far from it.
After the district applied through a notice for eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district notice asked for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They had to be above average, over six feet or five feet, two and a half inches tall.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said the job was physically too hard for women over 25.
"Your image is the important thing", an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc".
Then comes temperament and inner qualities.
Women chengguan are like florists, she said, adding, "besides being florists, they will have other responsibilities".
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to back that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job advertisements for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it's a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely the handicapped or disfigured should not come forward.
"We cannot allow a crippled person or a humpback to come to work here", said Mr. Zheng.
"His image would not be right".
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his colorful cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her looks is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old howl colleague Xu Yang said, "Our work must present the image of the city".
They also do not object to their fixed-time work, they said, because they harbor career ambitions greater than simply driving salesmen off the alleys where they are supposed to encircle their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces about a dozen street vendors who launch on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many tofu buns or bowls as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave".
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn carriage with noodle garnishes.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is pretty much the same every day", said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his spare time.
"Very routine".
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against the bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after a false rumor spread that Chengguan officers had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the nighttime episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For now, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is barely guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by regulations.
The motorcycle owner was yelling rude.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with bad faces, made their way to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Liedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men's squad, remained behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, male coordinators aged 40 and over play a purely supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain a stylish image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally".
"Sometimes we fight physically", Mr. Li said with total naturalness.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts the fight".
Prosecutors will not press charges against Senator Ensign
Senator Lawyers announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have exonerated Senator John Ensign of criminal charges stemming from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said it was "surely pleased" with the decision, which came after an entire year of investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of their investigation and that it has no plans to bring charges against him on this issue".
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have conspired to violate a federal criminal lobbying ban.
Interviews, email and other documents first leaked in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, get lucrative lobbying jobs to get Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, silenced about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign's assistant, he was barred under law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute", said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the Ensign decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared wary of accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks to its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, amid allegations of procedural misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that laws do not apply to them", he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's senior counsel, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to press charges against his client.
Ensign's defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted according to the law".
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we think they made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it didn't have enough evidence to prove the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got lobbying work thanks to Ensign's help to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "crushing" the Home Office over a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first came out last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, she said the senator expected the ethics committee to quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and conclude its investigation.
"Senator Ensign wishes to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada", he said.
Cheshire's appeal will be directed to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chattering" in the courtroom.
Minutes to minutes, they sent reports of the appalling testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter posts about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three family members in Cheshire, Connecticut, is set to come to an official end, with the judge's imposition of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have filed court papers outlining the arguments of the appeals that will likely occupy the courts for years to come.
One of the most provocative claims is that intense reports about the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere", and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force the appellate judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"From what I experienced during this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to a fair trial", said Thomas J. Ullmann, senior counsel for Mr. Hayes's defense.
First instance judge Jon C. Blue of the State Superior Court laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But it's probably not the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeals courts have recognized that covering famous cases can raise questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his ruling, in Sheppard v. Maxwell, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the TV show and movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appellate courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the way communication from courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report that said it was imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make judgments fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes' lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them spooky photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wrongly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had wrongly pressed for a verdict over his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
The jurors weren't kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most interest.
They noted in a refusal to file a verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually lit the fire of emotion over the case.
"The daily clustering of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom", the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state".
His attention on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that complaining about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly was a ludicrous view that would make the court's policy on control of coverage weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that appeals courts were often drawn to the arguments about the adaptation required in courts because of social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their letter, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the coverage of the trial, and made it clear that they would require that new media would require new rules.
"This case", they wrote, "represents the 21st century Sheppard v. Maxwell case".
Can civilization build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign of invective and negativity, this week has sparked a bit of civility in Washington.
Is this a harbinger of a genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no progress on the big issues that must be addressed during the outgoing session.
But by all accounts, it was at least a polite discussion of the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another empty episode to earn party points.
The public meeting of the President's deficit committee on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates the members.
That is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a testing period, probing each other to identify signs of cooperativism and commitment, as they try to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
The reason for the Tuesday meeting and subsequent evaluations by the participants were made with minimal demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deeply rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There's no doubt that things have changed with respect to the way things are said", said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They're inevitable after the election.
Elections awaken party passions, which then go extinct.
That's good".
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, the Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are due at the end of the year, and no one's for this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans cannot make it appear they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is increased optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that a period of disagreement was likely and even inevitable.
"After the things that must be done are done, psychology will in the short term reverse the situation to a confrontation", he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civilization can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012", he said.
The motives have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of overstating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut state spending and overturn the new health care law.
These lines of support are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit committee's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and increasing some taxes and the retirement age, and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own judgment, have forcibly introduced the issue of deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they've been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel, suggesting that in tax matters there is, at least currently, little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans in the White House and those in Congress.
The first will occur next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama over budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a stalemate, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch the reaction of the people closely.
Anyone who thinks he's losing will probably change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization today are greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked US document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city is controlled by a "cleptocracy", leaving a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects directly to the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority", takes its share as money rises in scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and he blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested corruption, he said: "It's crazy, it's a joke, it's a nuisance".
According to surveys, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find detailed details, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government to crime have led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' and to claim that the government operates more like a kleptocracy than a government", the memo states.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term from the criminal and mafia world that literally means 'roof' or protection) that crosses the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
"Analysts identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow".
"Luzhkov is at the top".
"SFS, MVD and militia are on the second level".
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level".
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services".
The report claims that the SFS collects money from the biggest companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report stated, "explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law".
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority".
The report notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed for one reason or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has admitted that little progress has been made.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust bureaucrats", Georgy Satarov, director of Indem's Moscow expert group, said in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy".
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia".
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked least corrupt).
The disclosure of the US embassy note, which did not occur until late at night Moscow time, will surely cause displeasure within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation claiming that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policies in this country", he said.
"But to be honest with you, we don't suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way".
Red Khmer veterans forced to face the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with stained and peeled walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School recalled the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader and cared about his people", said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fortress in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook here that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint UN-Cambodian court issued the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Anlong Veng Red Khmer, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can't do anything", said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil".
"This is generating divisions within families".
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-led government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the army soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have gained little benefit after surrender", said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime".
"They were raised without any concept for doing business".
55-year-old Sor Lim, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before devoting his life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine", he said.
"Ta Mok fed them all".
"But now life is hard because we have to self-sufficient".
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concern here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases beyond those four.
This didn't help much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district head in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that is thought to have killed thousands of forced labourers.
During a recent stormy afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden pilots on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She claimed that if the court summoned her she would not appear.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable", he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past", he said.
But confronting the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces", he said.
"It is our duty to gather these broken pieces together so that we can understand".
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connection to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But her parents reacted skeptically when she took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courtroom", he said.
"They have suspicions because they're unsure of how many people the court will prosecute".
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too much weed and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by an oxide-plated roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman by the side of the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him", he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day she decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last rest, where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its weapons-grade uranium reserve
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will give up its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the US government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations with Belarus were conducted in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the remaining material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke anonymously due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit".
"This shows that this process is working", said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-grade uranium) and low-enriched uranium", Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone".
"We use it for research purposes, that's all".
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating an interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly difficult, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was carried out by plane.
The US government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the research facility with low-enriched uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on Global Threat Reduction, said "this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen trust" that led to the Clinton-signed agreement.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will seek to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the Joint Declaration.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential detachment.
It stated that "while welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens".
The Spanish government has not repaired CIA flights
The Spanish government has not reversed the CIA's flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo via Spanish territory, the US ambassador in Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked the Spanish Executive to be informed so that "they could demonstrate that they exercised an appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights abuses, a meeting took place between the former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report had "taken the Zapatero Government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no regrets about intelligence flights through Spanish territory".
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "unprepared", Aguirre relates in a cable.
The then head of Exterior Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge's initiative to ask for the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Defense Ministry on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements or sensitive information", the Embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concern over the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors", rather than the declassified information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between Governments", Aguirre laments.
In March 2007 at a lunch between the US ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although Spanish judges are furiously jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero Government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US Government", he notes.
The confessed parish priest complained on the web of the "agony" of being a mother
The young woman was talking about the boy when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which she used since she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natural of Noia, the town of Coruña from which she is originally from.
The messages are from 2008.
To understand them, you need to know their sentimental lives, which ABC reconstructes through testimonies from their family.
The 30-year-old Galician began a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Tunes, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get his DNA tested.
Soon, she met another date.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even went to accompany her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, it can be seen that their romance broke, that they broke.
In March 2008, she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and muscular, because I came to work".
"When I told her it seemed fine, but of course, now she realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do whatever she wants".
Then, he talks about a message to the cell phone he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child to you".
She complains: "If you don't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back", she claims.
In May, he spoke of returning to his village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only be there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to apply for a job so I don't miss it".
He makes it clear that if everything goes well, he'll take his firstborn.
"He's going to be with who he owes, that is, with me, and I'll never in my life think of leaving him again with anyone but my mother", doubtful intent given his bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, is supposed to be dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but not on the other".
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other he's going to class almost every day".
He's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"He's going to go there for some summer classes, and I'll save some kangaroo pasta".
17, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, asking me when you come".
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to fuck off".
The other, 30, says, "The kid's fine, he's going to summer classes to learn Catalan".
Victor, his current partner, has one: "He's ahead of me".
There are his posts on the internet in blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had his own one in the MySpace universe, now intervening, where he was calling himself "Muki the ex-prisoner".
"Terror to the Galician (epigraph) ".
The last man who lived with her, jury guard, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to believe that everything happened because he didn't tell him that he was a single mother.
Monica entered yesterday in the provincial penitentiary of Palma, from the judicial detention center of Menorca.
Attorney-at-law Carlos Maceda said he does not remember how the events happened, "nor did he intend to cause any harm to the child".
Earlier, he did confess to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and depositing his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.

With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP has already set its sights on the general elections because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes this formation obtains in those elections is usually double that received in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the popular Catalan people got 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 regional elections, the figure rose to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, which has been fueled by a shift in PSC votes and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one deputy - now it has three - while ICV would either stay with one deputy or win one.
But if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular will also be decisive in ending socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in his relegation to the head of the Barcelona Diputación, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and popularists agree that the PSC may lose the Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona municipalities, where the socialists would not gain a majority or have the opportunity to rely on their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this group to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - 5% of the vote is needed.
The PP has increased its vote in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced they can take part in the upheaval in the Tarragona capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been only 500 votes away from the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
Popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is present in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to form lists in the maximum number of population.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detained in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona were a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the latter of the Bombay bombings that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Operation Kampai" Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus has been "weakened" internationally and, "therefore, its operational capacity".
The researchers estimate that the cell, in its two years of activity in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that their "combatants" could cross European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The detached cell is not the only one that the jihadist network has operated in Europe, hence other European police units have been involved in the investigations, in addition to the Thai services, so it is not ruled out that in the coming days similar coups will be carried out in EU territory to the one that took place last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another operation was carried out in Thailand with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who were directing the cell from Bangkok, Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists who met the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of men aged 25 to 45, with a validity of several years and no stamped visas.
Investigative media stress that, at present, no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, although the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "commando" that ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized ample documentation.
The PP demands Mas to park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already put forward during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and dispensing with pro-sovereignist adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalanes attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that she has obtained 18 deputies in the elections of last Sunday, more than enough to make herself want, because the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the vote of investiture.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress when general elections are held, but, for now, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as for the PP president, to support an investment "we will have to stop all the sovereignist and independenceist speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - which the converging leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to thinning down the political apparatus of a highly inflated regional administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiation on Mas' investment will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of Olot's center don't rule out their cell killer killing more than 11 seniors.
The officials of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while employed there killed at least eleven elderly people who were in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the center's lawyer, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible".
And it is that in addition to the social disgrace that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the target in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantious compensation that are already being calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' families.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients from the geriatric - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased but, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by phone.
The Caritat, through its director, yesterday sharply denied this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures cannot have been at any time the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is not a single indication in the case that there was an imprudent action by anyone other than the accused".
The already baptized as "Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders yesterday and detailed that the first crime he committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by injecting an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he committed with a combination of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control the access of the centre's staff to medicines.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine murders that the nurse, in his quest to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the lab that will have to clarify whether Vila didn't lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the cellador, not even to the number of murders confessed, which do not rule out that it is higher, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceedings after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That's why they say they're putting themselves at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that warned "markets should not underestimate our capacity to react".
The peripheral spreads have closed sharply and European banks' shares have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to be wrong, and the euro has barely rebounded, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is a characteristic of an illicit market which, however collapsed, recovers but is motivated by the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
It'll take the institutional investor a while to lose his fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded that the public debt purchase plan be terminated for ineffectiveness and that all extraordinary liquidity measures be eliminated on time and that only unlimited access be allowed per week.
After the Irish crisis we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures 'at least until March' and keep the quarterly auction open at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that you will continue your bond purchase programme and even signal to step up.
If they fail to meet the expectations they have generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they are still obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
As in their May meeting where they said they had not even considered buying bonds and the markets collapsed, tomorrow the story could be repeated.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazaar on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market crash.
Yesterday's auction of one-year letters in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury only issued $500 million at 5.28%, versus $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points throughout the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment following Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole figures have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potentials and they have until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are acceptable under the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget on Tuesday and it still does not have sufficient support, so Ireland remains a centre of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension ahead of the next Heads of State or Government Summit on 14 December, which calls for a political compromise that shows that we are united and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of us the Beethoven's hymn of joy.
In Spain, the President had the gift of opportunity when he presented yesterday the action plan which the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment sound in investors' ears like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish stock market has risen by 4,5%, double that of the rest of the European stock markets.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a relief plan would be self-immolation.
They'd give us a line of liquidity we don't need, the Treasury has more than $40 billion in liquidity available, triple that in March, at very high rates and closes you off from the markets.
However, the strategy must remain that of the Caesar's wife, "besides being, seemingly".
Come on, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the Vega Sicilia board requested by his sons
The storm is not a strain on the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "nula of full right", the judicial junta of El Enebro on the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to make their majority and make with the management bodies of the signature holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and Maria Jose are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation over control by the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding company to the company does not appear willing to give in to his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
He was removed from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who were appointed directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year and whose challenge is noted in the Mercantil Registry.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantil No. 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of thunder in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
The court of appeal to fix the meeting is the only legal mechanism which ensures that the meeting is convened until the dispute is resolved.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants their five children to, through procedural argument, clear fraud of Law and abuse of law, try to validate and sanitize the radically null junta of January 18", according to their official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the proceedings to be held by the junta, which considers it to be "null in its full right".
The same protagonists, who remain quiet, have already tried unsuccessfully to have the magistrate convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a joint stock company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's seven sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group, however, claims the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the fundamental question to be decided by the judge after the hearing of the appeal, for which there is no date yet set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software designs real-time improvements to cars.
Ever since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into account the options of a newly arrived squad and, despite the upward trajectory of the last few seasons, last November, in the championship final all bet on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without underestimating the ability of the eventual champion Sebastian Vettel, or the power of the Renault engine to propel his car, the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens has placed in Red Bull's hands to make it a winning team has become a legend in the Formula 1 world.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from high-level automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly chains for manufacturing plants around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, simulate and accurately simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory has enabled Red Bull to design and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four vehicle improvements during each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and project all kinds of modifications to the boilers.
The Siemens manager explained that PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull's boilers except the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this technological improvement madness is the figure of 40 million dollars that every Formula 1 team can spend maximum in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its bolts in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The team for this task is 580 people, including its two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula One is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety is zero.
The factory's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in wheelchairs accounted for 50% of the wins and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have varied and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice president Helena Herrero set an example of the remodeled store on Barcelona's Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branded sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The also head of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy for installing the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of the shops (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers training of staff in establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops intends to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchase, attention, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pilot program that is responsible for solving potential problems with HP's warranty computer equipment.
An online service connects to a technical centre in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days".
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services", said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell's bet to 'steal' a million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other managers, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
However, it envisages a drop in interest rates, which will be partly offset by commission increases and credit price increases.
Sabadell hopes to attract a million private clients in three years, his pending assignment.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 for a period of three years.
The aim, besides surviving without having to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share by attracting one million new private customers - 700,000 if discounted for those who can leave the bank - its longstanding subject, since it had so far spoiled more SMEs and companies than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it is more than 10%.
The Bank's financial position on the restructuring plan is based on the assumption that the restructuring plan will be implemented in the future.
Few banks today dare to set targets and make them public as the financial crisis has upset all the plans of global banking.
Sabadell will, in fact, close its Optima master plan this year, set four years ago, although it was initially for three, but the market situation has led to it expanding it for another year.
Clients who let the savings boxes slip will be your primary target.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendent" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the crisis outcome in Spain will be "slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", a key factor for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the war on liabilities - which penalizes margins - is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and boxes are paying for their issuances to obtain liquidity is already moving to the price of credit to offset the fall in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it will be a pressure factor on credit".
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher", Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already gave orders to his network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of the differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend of banking now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says, in Spain "greater sizes will be required".
"Next year everything is going to move", he assured.
It claims that capital needs are "very high" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institution is in red numbers.
It also points out that the FROB can supply the market with the funding for new recapitalisations.
After assuring Sabadell that he can survive the temporary market closure, he underestimated what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, it can get short-term funding through repos, which cushions the crisis.
The ECSC dismisses a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out a wave of mergers of savings boxes and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the Spanish savings banks were being consolidated, several companies said they would not participate in the first phase and would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Cashies (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that this new wave of operations is going to occur.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the addition of Cajasol to the Civic Banking group can't be said to be a second round, what's there are adjustments".
"Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been done and tutored by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in that too", the director noted.
In a statement during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the process of concentration is being undertaken "as quickly as possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is happening in the deadlines that in its day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he stressed.
"Possessing from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion in assets to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel", he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate opinions about the slow pace of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The ECSC Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who question it.
The director pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings boxes, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector was very well off the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoe and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros of unpaid unemployed aid, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe Gonzalez, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How should we interpret these movements?
Go ahead, Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with the one of maintaining the old traditions of many of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, speculation in Germany is beginning to emerge about the three possible outcomes to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favorable opinion stream, close to 50% of the population.
The third is a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines on the countries that have infringed, possible suspensions of payments of any of them and the extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government took a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed needed to be done (fiscal rigidity and fiscal stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second one was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended the rescue decision of Greece.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism at the time, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were very much against the Greek bailout.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel is once again emerging with a clear position, demanding reform of the EU treaties to make saving a country possible while also forcing private lenders to bear some of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But their proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should be attending the Union's reform process that will make it possible to take those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although measures must now be taken with which he may not agree, from that date on the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mark the birth of a new monetary area, where countries that infringe will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare themselves in default and, in that case, the private sector will also bear some of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a strong path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, is simply not going to be tolerated.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand.
It is not just a matter of bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand of us is much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these circumstances is fool ourselves.
I hope the current turmoil will give way to more tranquility.
And let's take advantage of the window of opportunity they've given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has understood this too and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that order must be put in the house has been opened up.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't look like they're going to move it.
And among the possibilities envisaged, the possibility of leaving a monetary zone too full of unimportant countries cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it has already warned us.
Sport and legal fraud
Traits like Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but not willingness to escape a penalty.
The allegedly urged expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink rivers to be written about whether such behaviour is or is not anti-sport and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, with a few minutes to go before the game (which their team had clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time in making foul tracks to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will be the leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction in the next league match, against Auxerre, and can pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned the team's coach, Jose Mourinho, with two matches and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the football world.
It's so widespread that it's part of the ethos, the unwritten, but followed rules, of this sport.
Part of the debate in the case is due to the fact that it was starring a team from the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and which has sometimes fined its players for similar acts in the past) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative technical.
In any event, the debate is whether this type of behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the regulations, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether such actions are fraudulent; indeed, they are actions respectful of the rules of sport, but seem to evade their meaning.
The question is to examine the kind of damage they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the assets of the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these assets that is alluded to by clean play is preventing the team of offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen either.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that they did not fit into what we normally describe as a trap or fraud of the law, because their violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid sanction, but precisely their action tried to be the most obvious to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders gain in the deliberate failures examined.
It seems necessary to note that the competition is not disadvantaged or profitable in the same match, as the result of the action is obviously to leave the team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club won't be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, as the team can be eliminated at the first change, and in addition with this action the players meet a penalty match and move on to the second round of cards, in which the card accumulation suspension occurs with a lower one than in the first round.
So, going through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions are not against the spirit of sport, which includes making strategic decisions that will help to make the most of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to evade the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without escaping or escaping punishment.
Although the line between wit and law fraud is blurred, I think this time it was a clear case of wit.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way in which the guideline to provoke them was transmitted.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of bids to capture group Christmas dinners in NCBs
The calendar dictatorship is concentrating on an avalanche of reserves for the 16th and 17th.
Self-sacrificing celebrations are proliferating among employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turrón and the lottery, with the arrival of December, the group dinners before Christmas also return, which continue to exercise oxygen balls for Barcelona's restaurant and leisure, but which due to the crisis have led to a price offensive adjusted to be able to capture the majority of customers: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed agree.
To make matters worse, this year's calendar (with New Year's Eve on Friday) has focused the requests on the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (16 and 17) and little movement for the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean cows stage began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To keep the tradition alive, many workers keep it afloat.
Whatever the situation, some demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, to this day, does not dare to predict how the celebrations this month will be.
"People think about it a lot before they book".
"He wants to go out but he has the price alerts on", he points out.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, recalling that customers tend to go down a ladder with the crisis, so the range around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
A survey of several central establishments found that petitions had collapsed by the night of the 17th.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a real boom of applications for that Friday, with the pretence of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since early November.
"We have done everything possible to keep prices the same as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros", they detail.
In AN Grup, which leaves El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locations, they remain optimistic after detecting a surge in turnover since the second half and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources in the group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate the parties.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas menu, with 30 euros or more as the star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
You also see green outbreaks in some companies that invite their employees back and feel that the volume of groups is a little bit higher.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association), its vice president, Enric Gomà, is confident of starting to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that the reservations are "animated", although customers "negotiate to the maximum".
Yes, the celebration enthusiasm has not decreased, pay who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program is a major concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
WikiLeaks leaks confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the huge concerns that Pakistan's nuclear program is causing in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and the thoughts of the accredited US diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security, rather than increasing, is "growing", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that weapons are not assembled but are stored in components to make it harder to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's alarm.
This is what the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, said in a report ahead of the visit of then-National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transporting atomic materials".
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is seen, not only by the US but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep on guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect the nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs", said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with his US counterparts.
The latest in the documentation leaked by the Julian Assange portal is the declining cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and Pakistan's high rate of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, calling the communication with Pakistan "frustrating", said: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of aid are either left unanswered or discarded".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official at the National Intelligence Service for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also urged Washington, during a visit by Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end its tacit support for terrorist groups".
In pursuit of the Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol is issuing a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange where he is.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it's hard to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, it's not new, but it's from November 20.
And it's not about the latest leak of over a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents but about the sexual abuse allegations the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens' lawyer says "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange".
On the 20th day, the international police body based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not released until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
As a matter of fact, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications to identify or locate Assange "in view of his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many member countries, the organization has explained, do consider the so-called red notice free-way to proceed with an arrest - which must be undertaken by the national police force - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move has angered Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks has been willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, whom they compare to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution", the letter complains.
While the world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange remains in unknown location, but not silent.
On Monday, he granted an interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype from an undetermined location, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering American diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the US has signed, he should resign", he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation petition "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website", he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counterterrorism official, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to underestimate Assange contrasts with the views these days proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, has asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and fund them and pursue anyone who makes any contributions or aid".
Even further has gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to back down after saying Assange should "be killed".
"Obama should make it a target and use a drone or something".
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be a too kind punishment", he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to Carod's relatives
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to bypass the one-third internal revolt in the ERC ranks, without north by the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The party's president is aware that his stepfather's resignation is insufficient for his former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of Esquerra will try to win the new critics with winkings that allow him to arm himself until the municipal elections.
For starters, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national advisers of ERC will be able to speak on its continuity in secret.
By paperwork, not by hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the chief of staff wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said he would not be considered ratified with half plus one vote, but added, without specifying percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand that the president do more than make his position available to the militancy, a gesture that is not worthwhile when Puigcercós controls the highest organ between congresses.
But not having enough majority to force resignations, they're going to try to agree with the executive on a roadmap by May.
They hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document which the management will submit to the vote of the national council on 18 May.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in return for him promising to advance the congress to autumn 2011, something the summit already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that "polyphony" is detrimental to stability and that his goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash the dirty rags of doors inward.
In this regard, the article signed by the acting consul Josep Huguet on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the head of Innovació took for granted that the leader will be refrenched "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new faces from the Carod-related sector.
The second one may be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assembly as a working mechanism.
He thus advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through delegates elected by vote.
The end of the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of Puigcercós' team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the task of reviewing the assembly at a specific congress on statutory reform to the management.
This is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years has warned against tackling the issue.
Now, with no critical sectors on the lookout, it may be a good time to pick it up and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO, the State of Mexico recorded a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO State of Mexico.

In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the blackwater channel of the Golondrina Beach colony.
Emergency bodies conducted a thorough search of the other members of the body, however they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán warned of the discovery of a body in the area of Peña Colorada, tied with his hands back and his head tied.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
Half a month ago, two men were reported executed, who were wrapped in coffins and left in the cajuela of a vehicle in the streets of the fractionation Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizapán in Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of death warnings.

The first of them was beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag on the streets of the Colonia Juárez.
Next to him, the agents found a card with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to re-convert its industry.
In fact, he said, in the last four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made clear that China will not change its objectives but will continue to work together with the international community on this matter.
He noted that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas there have been progress, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set in terms of reducing emissions of gases, he explained.
He also noted that in China, the federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities to achieve the energy saving, energy efficient use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, several multiannual plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries, are in progress or have already been concluded.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficient Use Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private sector.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for changing incandescent foci to savers and another for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government's scientific adviser on climate change, said China's efforts have been greater than is generally thought.
For example, he exposed, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and plans to do so much more by 2020.
Legally attached expelling Espino: César Nava
The PAN national leader detailed that the former Panist leader is entitled to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what his right accords.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former panist leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what his right agrees.
In an interview prior to the protest by Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken in the local area.
'This is an autonomous decision of the Commission of the Order of Sonora.'
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal, if necessary, via complaint to the Ordinance Committee of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body", he noted.
He also clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy has never been on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action will be strengthened by the internal election on 4 and 5 December, when his successor will be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and fulfilled the goal", he said.
The Panist leader said that the PAN has 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; we enjoy it and it strengthens us", he said.
He said that without a doubt the council will know how to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence he will deliver the scam "to whom the council determines".
"I have that absolute peace and openness, to any of the five I would be proud to hand over the office of the party president".
He predicted that the rebound the party recorded in the last elections on July 4 will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "it's not time yet to think about 2012".
"For now, it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a cause for observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
When asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on priests to reflect on the sequesters of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that Zedillo and Salinas' governments were better than Fox and Calderon's, they should start defending them, get out of the closet", he said.
He said the head of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no scolding and much less censorship.
Obama promotes legislation on Twitter in favor of undocumented students
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and instruct them to pass this legislation", the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization today in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the appropriate thing, call your senators and instruct them to pass this legislation", Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps a cyber link open with a broader document asking the public to contact the senators immediately, given that the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard", he notes.
The message was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation unless the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation.
Queried by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs confided that once the tax issue is resolved, a schedule for the rest of the projects will be set.
"I think there's a lot of time... "
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax matter before the end of the year"...
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest", he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would ask for a "closing debate vote" on the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, though it's more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before age 16, have stayed in the country for the past five years and entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, requiring the participation of a handful of Republicans, as pro-project organizations engage in intense lobbying to ensure the law's approval.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Yet at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has voiced support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That's why supporters of the Dream Act are demanding that several Republicans be added in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Maine senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have stated they will not back it on another occasion.
Another Republican he supported, John McCain, has not defined his stance at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the wound
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where participants gave a gala of storytelling
"I understand that of The Sex in the Language but... the finger in the wound? what is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of her question (at another fair the round table was dedicated to The Sex in the Language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "puts us in a tight spot", the Argentine writer sweetly spat out to the public, mostly young, who took part in the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great tale, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "link" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not get answers although it does clues in the same narrative thread.
The infectious disease specialist is convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
Finally, after a frustrated approach to the trauma specialist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the hallway, but whoever makes it clear that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relievedly and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must go very far.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative titled Elogio de la invención, where the finger in the wound is not named but in a moment it is discovered.
With brushes of magical realism, it tells of a famous witch, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that had lost a maiden, a narrative that turned to talk America, the great novel that did not lack from the beginning its own chroniclers to tell it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
"The preserver who invented us all (the writers) mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told with the imagination that was lacking to the modest".
However, he stressed "it is the madmen and the con artists who imagine best" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known whether the narrated belongs to one side or the other, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
It's actually called the "Cervantine tradition".
"By his inheritance we are what is counted".
In turn, writer Mayra Montero has embraced and applauded the variety of interpretations that the FIL invitation with her round table El dedo en la plaga gave rise to.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican woman pointed her own to the great scourge of social violence that runs through her country - and shares Latin America - as a result of the disputes over drug trafficking and sale.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs entail a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated", he said, after citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the writer committed to the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatism, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To be the master of our thinking and master of reality we have to nuance: and nuance means many times to put the finger on the scar and to annoy those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established and unnuanced ideas and to annoy also the powers that prefer a black and white world", he said, inviting them to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With Santos Laguna and Monterrey's duel in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Ruben Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up getting consoled with the sub-champion medal, he has stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Open Tournament, when he was leading the reins of Morelia with which he fell for a 4-2 overall loss to Toluca; subsequently, in the Clausura 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a 3-1 overall and was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again before the Devils, Rubén again suffered a setback, as his team finished tied 2-2 before the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shoot-out he put in front by 3-1 with two chances to seal the title for finally three of his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the voltereta 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he doesn't want to run the same luck, he seeks to get rid of the curse and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a fan I owe and consequently the title will come to me, but the above is the most important thing", the driver commented when asked about the numbers he has against playing finals.
He said he learned a lot from the previous final, "the only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can't celebrate, we are ready in the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalty shoot-outs we were ready to run and I think that's a lesson, until the game is over we can celebrate".
Knowing that this series could be defined as penalty shoot-outs, something that does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never try to get to the penalty shoot-out, you try to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately fate made a bad move for us, sometimes because of the nerves or anxiety of having the title in our hands, but we left, that left us something for this final that we hope does not reach that instance".
Romano has to stop being a technician runner-up and prove for the first time the glory that titles bring.
EU changes to visa rules
The visa applicant must visit the Visa Applicant Service before the interview in the Consular Section; the cost and waiting time will be lower.
As of 10 January 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicants Service (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff shall take the biometric information of the applicant, which shall be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer will there be a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another payment for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant shall only make a single payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases with a request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for business and investor visas.
Those wishing to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants requiring a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will stay there less than in the past.
Also, those applying for visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of 26 dollars.

NASA will announce the discovery of alien life
The U.S. space agency quoted a press release saying it will present a finding tomorrow that will impact the search for living things in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The findings will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 13:00 at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as the one in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA assured it would present "a finding that will impact the search for extraterrestrial life", prompting speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures along our side in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they would become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
Apparently, it's a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any life form, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another life form, a second life form, different from the one we know".
The space agency will release the true scope of the findings at the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to combat the use of the 'block' of the 'block' of the opposition.
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartism', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not being installed when an opposition bloc emerged in the Congress, led by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four were questioning one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chamber.
Before the session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'trone' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it starts the 'bipartisanship', because now there will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, he detailed that with these reforms institutionally constitutes the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He said that in the coming days they will talk with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overwhelmed again by both parties and with it the opposition coalition ended.
"So far it has come (the opposition coalition), that's what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, nor do they have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
He continued, "You cannot allow Congress, after being monopoly, to be now 'duopoly'.
"It is not in the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipatidism in Congress".
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other colleagues and comrades to make them more, the convergent said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress became a 'botin' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"It used to be just a game, now they're splitting it between two".
Patrón Montalvo, asked that the personality of the deputy be respected, that his place be given at the negotiating tables.
"That not by coupon agreements, let out 5 that we will probably make 9 deputies, now the five that see us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform they did that they agreed, we are out and we are not in agreement with that reform".
$200,000 more coming out for "the supplier"
Mazatlan City Council pays another check to the questioned owner of an electrical equipment company.
A cheque for more than 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, this latest check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts to pay".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had forecast that more money would come out of the Comuna in favor of this provider, which was observed by the State's Superior Auditory for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total still owed to him and, therefore, how many more checks are still to be sent in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you're just getting paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last one on 16 November.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official State Gazette, as the law states when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not reused its services.
This, after July 25, Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos was paid by the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent attention to tourist sites
Tourism entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Commercials of the Golden Zone, recalled that at different times they have denounced that the image of the destination be taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and turn around the nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to shut down a company one day and have no idea how much money is lost, or else they wouldn't have done the work this way in such a long time and without proper planning".
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to take on its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it because giving preventive maintenance and not falling only in the corrective", he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only as a tourist area must be maintained, but as residents we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well".
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, like the Shield and the Mazatlan Venadito.
"Today, for tourists to come, it's not just about promotion, it's about good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, its avenues, permanent maintenance on what are tourist attractions", he said.
"There has been no due attention and this kind of fact highlights something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is needed".
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that rescue of Mazatlán's tourist sites is urgent, as they are not being properly exploited and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put in line together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote to the destination".
He asks Congress for IP results
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges it faces.
A decent and free of agreements between parties and the state executive legislature demands the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa facing big problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature, comprising seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, has been installed.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean and committed management with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that do not repeat the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Coordinating Business Council, proposed that the newly released 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the deputies will really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary for them to make arrangements to look after their own interests and become carnival partners of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions".
He therefore called for them to certify their commitment to establish the necessary bridges to carry forward the Governor in turn.
"We are busy with them coming to do a dignified job and above all committed to society and sectors because it was the Sinaloenses who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotels Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of economic growth in the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation".
As for tourism, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight he weighs within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruent as an important economic activity and generator of foreign exchange and investment and that it directly competes with the agribusiness".
In addition, it is required to label resources to detonating tourism projects that help to give security to the state and in updating the Alcoholes Law that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
A wizard king is sought
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next King's Day will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan, and Miguel did not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar, and Baltazar would give them the toys and clothes they so longed for.
The family lives in a humble house in the Salvador Allende Colony and live on a daily basis because the father has no fixed job.
"Sometimes we find ourselves hard because my husband has no belly, but we sell mandarin and potatoes... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street", said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Isabel, 3, wants a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests carved clothes for a year.
"He told me (Jose Alfredo), 'I would like this monster,' but I said 'let's see son', because it was very expensive", Cayetana remembered sadly.
For older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is 12 inches tall; Isaiah, 10, is 10 inches tall; Miguel, 8, is 8.
Jose Juan, 14, is short on tennis, so a pair of five-and-a-half or six-size shoes would be of great help.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign Seeking a Wizarding King, donating a toy or cash to the Northwest reception.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions were carried out in the context of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
Persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and production equipment have been seized", says Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for Quebec's security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees were required to appear at the Sherbrooke Palace of Justice within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have come after a lengthy investigation that has lasted for about a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests", Mr Ruel said.
About seventy agents from the Quebec Security Estrie Investigation Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
You can fight illegal migration without problems
The Conservative bill, which the government says should address the problem of the loaded feet of illegal migrants, will surely face a lot of opposition, as the three opposition parties announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely primarily on the Charter".
"I am here with a party that has created the granite you are treading on", Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone to be detained for up to a year from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc de Québec, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
"We are against and, as it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the Government does", Mr Duceppe said.
NPD immigration critic Olivia Chow has bluntly rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
"Neodemocrats agree that measures are taken against those responsible for the clandestine patters and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35", says Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the conservative bill because it attacks refugees and jails children for at least a year", Ms Chow explains.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of playing politicians and ignoring Canadians' will.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country like a felpudo".
"They expect Canada to take firm measures", says Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a confidence vote on its bill, which could lead to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would request a vote to be held so that every deputy who opposes himself can explain himself to his constituents.
The new unity does not achieve unanimity
Although the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest had been announced, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the matter.
Public Safety Minister Robert Dutil supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation on the matter since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
As a result, Tuesday's announcement has caught more than one person by surprise.
It should be noted that, at a meeting of the Standing Council on Police Services in Quebec on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec Party's public safety critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as "a rabbit out of the box" and "a last-minute slam dunk".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it", he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem".
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on preventing the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide", he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, he suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the general contractor to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general contractor", he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thereby enabling him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project underway in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt it to this type of crime.
This request appears to have come from the prosecutor for the Marteau operation, who has informed Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister for Public Safety Vic Toews has confirmed that his Justice counterpart Rob Nicholson is currently inclined to make certain amendments in this regard.
During the Spring 2001 operation involving motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently pushed for the passing of the Gangster Law.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a precaution, two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, an additional 20 to 40 millimetres are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitation increases the snow melting that has already accumulated in certain areas, several rivers are feared to overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers in Saint-Jérôme, Laurentides and Chêne, Lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a precaution, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, according to Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Centre on Wednesday issued announcements reporting the strong flooding of several rivers, notably the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
They're partially blaming Dupont.
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered some setbacks at the Canadian Council of Radio-television Standards (CCNR) over controversial statements about social assistance and about Haitians, as well as his rude language on radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr Dupont and his team at CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "incorrect information about social assistance, unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day".
The Council also noted that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, do not violate broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints in relation to comments made on broadcast emissions between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Quebec Social Assistance People's Common Front.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were incorrect.
The presenters must communicate reliable data and not misleading data.
In relation to the suicide, the presenter Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most of the Committee members have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life's problems.
'The majority of the Committee considers that the questionable episodes of Dupont le midi have dealt with a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate manner.'
The Commission has therefore rejected any blame in this respect.
The last litigation concerned statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At the time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had been in a media confrontation that had sparked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there".
"My file has been clean for a year and a half", the presenter declared.
In all its decisions, the Committee denounces the use of rude language.
In any event, the CHOI-FM radio station has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, which must, inter alia, announce the decisions once at the peak hours within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
The Montreal-born Algerian Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, climbs the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria", explained Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I look for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the game on the ground that mixed martial arts involves, there are few competitions in North America".
The athlete, who works as a security officer and employee of UPS, recently gave bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur Championship, held from October 23 to 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won in the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories", he explained.
"I'm currently preparing to participate in the World Cup of San Shou in China".
"They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four at the last world championship in each category".
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth".
"In 2007, in China, I finished fifth, but I came in third in Toronto in 2009", he added.
"The interesting thing is I've been making progress in every competition".
"At this step, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
San shou or sanda is a Chinese discipline in which punching with fists and feet is allowed, as well as throwing opponents to the ground.
The clashes were originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous fighter in this type of combat is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, widely recognized in the martial arts world.
Although Born Zemmal must only keep a competition in his career, he will undoubtedly attend the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most famous and prestigious in China", explains the friendly boy.
"It's like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand) ".
"It's been an amazing experience".
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"The one who won me is a real professional", he says.
'There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg).'
"The winners of the semifinals face each other at the end of their category".
"Then the champions of each category compete to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu".
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this flood of more than 100 contracts is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained the largest contract, the project management contract, for a sum of 295 million without a previous tender.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with the responsibility of managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the energy management consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender having been previously held.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and lead to a rise in prices.
"It's a new method of collusion and eliminating competition".
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly", said yesterday the Quebec Party deputy Sylvain Simard at a press conference.
Earlier this morning Mr Simard raised the question in the National Assembly because he said he did not understand how the public interest could be benefited in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, firmly denying any collusion with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired", he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted "unfairly" and "with a lack of rigor".
He said the "minimum" would be for PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
It is usually a time-limited partnership that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity, taking into account the scale of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In all cases, the contract was awarded without competition being involved; it was a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the rule in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula for consortia in the technical advisory sector is undergoing government investigation.
A quick look at Quebec's trade register identifies more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
Dessau thus works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, Dessau.
As regards the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the James Bay area responds to a particular labour dynamic and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s".
The main head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation which highlights the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
"If you answer a bid and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher".
"You have two options: you can contact the players in the sector and tell them: we'll negotiate a satisfactory deal and a good price".
"The idea is, however, that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people", Mr Laporte noted.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Génivar has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not taking into account its participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Energy Gerance contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has hinted that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has pointed out that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is more about its leaders.
The green label does not inspire confidence
More environmentally friendly, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in sustainable development actors, trade marks or green certificates to guide his choices.
The report, which was published yesterday, shows that the situation is even worse: consumers are immersed in a media world where messages are being circulated that advocate more responsible consumption, but regret the lack of reliable information and consider it to even curb their commitment.
Even though consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not trust companies' environmental commitments or their environmental advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by the responsible consumer observatory at the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates bearing so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are 'eco-responsible', says Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any event, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the dubious nature of the information lead 46% of consumers to reject this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers say they also distrust the supposed yields of the green products or services they are trying to sell.
Moreover, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood shops and preferred to buy food products grown in their region, notes the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points out of a maximum of a hundred this year), Homo consumus de Quebec loves to be the king of recycling, which tries to reduce its impact on the environment by protecting wildlife.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be out of doors: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behaviour survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and walking.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit itself financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but only by a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, which had been expecting a seven million dollar donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy back the eXcentris cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard from Daniel Langlois and return his true filmmaking vocation, have not gotten what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to get involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would in fact be lower than initial expectations; this could be a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public servants.
Quebec had already rejected an initial action plan and an application for 12.8 million last spring, but since then the applications have been revised downwards.
The President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris dossier, forwarded a proposal and an action plan to the Minister St-Pierre.
She sent you a final report a dozen days ago.
However, the SODEC received a counterproposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallelle and Angus have until 31 December to reply to the same.
In any event, it seems that the hypothesis of a State grant must be completely discarded.
Recall that the Association of Owners of Cinema and Cinematographic Complex in Quebec opposed a direct State investment to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector do claim considerable financial aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has carried the burden of the author's cinema for ten years in his premises of the complex, after financing its own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of independent movie theaters is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had managed to retain its clientele.
Angus and Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing for a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to open the way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these theaters, the Parallèle, continues to screen films on eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27th, showing Xavier Beauvois's precious film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada is lifted complicated...
The new US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers the complexity of Canadians with respect to Americans, but they also reflect the latter's feeling of superiority over Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don't think about Canada-U.S. relations when they vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government get its 2009 budget approved!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable from September 22, 2008, during the federal election campaign, shows how far the United States has fallen from the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the U.S. ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex inferiority virtually inherent in Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign)", he writes.
Consequently, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to speak of".
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he thinks, the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, a party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting".
This sense of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival during the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will register a deficit for the first time in a decade due to a $30 billion to $40 billion recovery plan", writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that the opposition parties conditioned their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series aired on the US CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which make subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even the kidnappings for the CIA to conduct vigorous interrogations.
Another cable reports that during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to take in some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner said yes, but it was "on a case by case basis".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State in relation to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin".
"The secretary agreed to review the file".
Finally, we can mention that there has been a warmth of anger over the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the person responsible for this mass leak should be "murdered".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee is echoed.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in a hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by an amount that corresponds to almost a third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the planet's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of a series of major concrete projects the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still hold 50 to 70% of the market, were replaced by fluorescent bulbs or, even better, by light-emitting diode (DEL or "LED") bulbs, much of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It's equivalent to 70% of the emissions from the planet's fleet of cars.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitter countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of that amount should be further reduced to stabilise, before 2020, the rise in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from spiraling out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat and the rest, that is, 5% produces light.
In the case of fluorocompact lamps, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new LED lamps, energy consumption is reduced even more than twice.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
New LED bulbs, such as those launched by Philips this week (a company that also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a flashlight, giving us an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be implemented in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with reostats and emit very little heat.
On top of that, they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have expressed reservations about fluorocompact bulbs, which contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the report notes, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet are not fluorescent bulbs but coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted on incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants costing 2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast looks forward to announcing the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast to be published "immediately" as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately", a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"It calls on all parties and institutions in Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced".
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission has allowed the deadline to pass Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days after Sunday's vote.
Some 40 minutes before the deadline expired, the chairman of the CIS had told television that the commission was "still working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for the CII to finally announce the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara were mounting around the world.
However, Gbagbo's side has been able to overturn the constitutional council's "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former New Forces (NF) rebellion since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager for the president of Ivory Coast, has said that FN's campaign intimidation of voters in the north of the country has deterred the outgoing president's supporters from voting.
The whole election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
Gbagbo's opponents, however, consider the country's highest court to be neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any connection to the former rebels, has deemed the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the election commission from spreading the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday should have set the stage for the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivory Coast political class on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the vote versus 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on the mainland (9.7% taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, with 9.3% of the workforce in the mainland and 9.7% in the OCT.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with the unemployment rate rising again to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the ILO's direction.
On the other hand, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, reaching 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50, a figure of 6.6% for the DOM.
Unemployment has only been stable among people aged 25-49, with an 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and an 8.8% in all of France.
Since 2006, the monthly unemployment rate has not been published by the Insee, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so, announcing a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, following a 9.9% rate in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a waste management company manager and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, is under investigation and has been jailed in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking of influences and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions the magistrate asks him, not ghosts".
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it is another thing to prove them", his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client's appearance.
Mr Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and also imprisoned one of their closest people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all his client has done is deal with the landfills he must manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to lawyer Simon.
In the context of this case, he is also being investigated since Wednesday, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for money laundering and complicity, but he has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the main actors of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been reproached against him".
"The instructor magistrate has taken the explanations into account and has released you", explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night, four other people were questioned and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, said the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been charged with "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "abduction and misappropriation of public property by a person engaged in public service" and "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner Jeannie Peretti is being investigated for "covering up social property abuse".
Among those who have faced Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently jailed in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect their companies have a service to launder capital from big banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the context of several court orders initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation notes that the investigations are particularly focused on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the Marseille urban community (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Elisha has exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", has kept the public in France in suspense, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of American diplomats.
US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice on managing their own "hostage" crisis in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not come in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian man detained in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media into thinking that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage-taking cases".
The Elisha adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Quai d'Orsay director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, are speaking with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly held in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "continuously squeeze" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
All to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do so more often".
Because once the negotiation efforts through discrete channels are exhausted, "silence will solve nothing", the Iranians are "experts in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announced that Clotilde Reiss's release from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day he takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros reward).
It also notes that Elisha anticipates further hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
The Iranians could "arrest in the near future another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran", he says.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days, but she's locked up in Iran.
The following information is being circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge's decision.
The US Embassy, like many observers, doubts this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which closes Iranian clandestine nuclear material acquisition networks, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Release the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier guarantees that this was not the case.
Elisha, he says, not only "has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision", but he has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot overturn the decision" judicial, he comments.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand is still under "close" surveillance by the French intelligence services.
Elisha's adviser marks a phone number, hangs up and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss's detention in Iran, Elisha does not spare in efforts, using organized press releases and "leaks" to make it appear that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and prove that manipulation is paying off, since several press articles broadcast the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is the reason for such "gratitude" towards Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
"Despite their praiseful statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done".
The following document discusses the reasons that led Elisha to this fiction.
The major communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria", he said.
A policy launched in 2008 that "in the opinion of numerous critics in France and abroad, had just been dismissed as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris is trying to "show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow the seed of the dispute between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier confides: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not".
"But anyway, we thanked you".
"At least this should cause confusion among Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is receiving her at the Elise.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
From midnight, Korean youths can't play online
The South Korean government is going to adopt a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to those games after midnight for young people under 16, representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family have said.
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day".
"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep", said AFP's Jo Rin, minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, she said.
The government is also asking companies to limit the daily access to these games when the parents of the young people so request, the official added.
It will also make free software available to anyone who requests it, which will limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates the organizing countries
Amid the storm of suspicions of corruption, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday designates the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political choice where struggles of influence and lobbying can come to dominate over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Transactions between racks, therefore, may last until the last minute.
It is also difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to FIFA's assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) applications have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too weighty for the 22 members of the Executive Committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of its football-birthplace, which hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the fire on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has highlighted three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to displease FIFA and embarrass the British officials, who have launched an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The Prime Minister hopes to re-publish the coup successfully taken by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had secured the organisation of the 2012 JHA for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England's splendor to the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to their ready-made stadiums, their experience (Munial 82 in Spain, JJOO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they achieve is to give points to Russia, which has become a heavy outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote", in a direct reference to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They are going out to uncover their dirty rags, trying to compromise them", Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, with the experience of 1994, seems the logical favorite.
The country, the world's leading economic power and home to FIFA's main sponsors, seems to be taking advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new applications seem premature for two countries that have jointly hosted the 2002 championship.
Another risk: the 2026 World Cup concession to China, which FIFA has so much wanted, would cause Asia to be left without a chance for 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weak pay-TV rights (based on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had hinted that he doubted.
The Commission has already adopted a number of proposals for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less.
One mandate in the Elisha leads to another.
The current head of state will therefore stand again in 2012.
However, the evidence for this does not match well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidency.
Therefore, it must always appear that he doubts.
One way and the other.
In 2006, although they didn't believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed he wasn't ruling out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
The fact that he deals with MPs on Tuesday night in the Elisa, the possibility of "two terms" has caused some uproar.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not even close.
The president was merely stating that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just passing on the facts, not an ad.
It's not the first time he's spoken of the presidential race, in a funny tone, at meetings like this.
"In the worst-case scenario, you'll still spend seven and a half years with me", he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010, he said: "Don't think I don't think about what's coming next".
Your remarks the day before today don't bring you any closer to running for office, nor do they bring you any less.
They're raising comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the PS candidate race, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has come to the fore that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
Rather, the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to claim that the battle is organized earlier than planned.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44% according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the subject at the UMP", the Prime Minister's environment reacted immediately and prudently.
"If you think you can lose, you will not be a candidate", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its government-backed securities acquisitions
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow for the details of how to exit the crisis or at least announce the suspension of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations which should be completed by the end of the year.
The Frankfurt issue institute cannot afford to be so peremptory because of the European sovereign debt crisis if it does not want to risk aggravating a more complicated situation on the European bond markets today.
The political cost would be just as high.
At a press conference yesterday, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, supported the ECB's active role in solving the European debt crisis.
He did not say whether he considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its government bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my opinion to my fellow Europeans"....
The ECB President, Jean-Claude Trichet, spoke no more eloquently of his intentions in Brussels during his hearing before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs the day before yesterday, only stating that the programme for buying government bonds in the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we will see what we decide" at Thursday's meeting.
The ECB will maintain its main rate of inflation at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's acquisition of Treasury bonds has doubled last week to about €1.350 billion.
In addition, according to the undisclosed market operators, he would have bought Irish and Portuguese bonds again yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have acquired securities for a total of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is little doubt that purchases will follow among market operators (see page 29).
Economists also do not anticipate any significant changes in direction.
Although the ECB's arsenal of over three months' loan operations has already disappeared, it still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on favourable terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to last for a few months today.
"I don't think I'm going to change your program significantly".
"If not, it would risk triggering further tensions in the short term", says Commerzbank economist Michael Schubert.
"It seems more likely that a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 will occur", anticipates Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
I'm not going to say.
In relation to public debt market intervention, 'the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of such bonds in order to maintain market stability', adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of the exposures of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs compensate for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked increase in the returns paid by the most fragile States", said a senior bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, states will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is capping the storm
After Italy had started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of bond rates to 10 years.
A recovery from the precarious calm.
At the outset of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, regional presidents have said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indescifrable" and that an "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any event, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of the bankruptcy risk coverage contracts (CRQ) had soared to 263 points, causing a certain uproar in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that in Spain the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, expressed "deep concern" about "turbulence in markets" and a possible outbreak from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
The problem is, in fact, the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have meant a cold water jar for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget under consideration in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates that the public deficit will be 4,3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3,9% forecast by the government) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
The Commission has therefore proposed that new budgetary provisions for the sum of EUR 7 billion be implemented after the holidays.
'If necessary, new austerity measures should be adopted,' said Commissioner Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently supported by international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time", says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation efforts requested from Italy are less than those required from other countries", says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, an unfavorable period for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis would be opened up.
The European Union is also working on a new approach to combating the crisis.
Christine Lagarde has already repeated this yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think we have already shown on Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly in solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone".
Although relatively low, the easing of European State debt rates yesterday has given the governments and the ECB a boost.
However, we cannot yet speak of a normalisation principle.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems", Exane BNP Paribas economists say.
Especially because "the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets".
The European countries, aware of this gap and the dangers it poses, are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing mechanisms to resolve the crisis.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are going well.
This is also the case with the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures supporting euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
The European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) Executive Director Klaus Regling has launched a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly sets the stage.
The first issues of EFSF securities are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in the funds mobilized through an additional direct IMF commitment.
The countries at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for structural reforms, particularly in relation to labour market organisation.
These reforms are in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before implementing their own budgetary adjustments and deciding on the structural reforms they consider indispensable to build confidence in a lasting way.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds are asking for the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of the public bond markets.
On 24 November, when passing by Paris, Axel Weber was the first to suggest that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to pull the money back.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an additional amount of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, 'preferably' in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
The instrument for this is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which currently has 60 billion euros.
A piece of advice which could certainly be examined in detail in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause difficulties in traffic, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, 24 departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already on orange alert, eighteen since Wednesday at noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affects northern Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on Île de France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Île de France and Lemosine.
Snowfall is strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited for heavy vehicles over 7,5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles.
According to the gendarmes, traffic on the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that you do not drive unless necessary and certain TER vehicles are prohibited from driving during the day.
On Thursday, school transportation in Picardy was banned.
No specific measures were planned Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at the Paris airport in Roissy and 10% at Orly on Thursday due to the forecast snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
The Grand Paris Metro: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport on the French island reached its peak, billions have fallen.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris subway that the Société du Grand Paris is to build.
To start this GSP, the State has announced a €4 billion allocation of funds.
In theory, this sum will be the one that will later enable the GSP to obtain loans in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Rectification Finance Act, examined by the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the office tax on the French island.
The first, as we read in Article 15 of the text of the bill, is 'for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris'.
It also says in numbers: "The income from this tax is 117 million euros a year".
The second is an amendment to an existing office tax 'to modernise it, increase its output and allocate that increase to the Société du Grand Paris'.
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
The text does not give figures.
But it's far from 4 billion.
"The tax resources are to be added to the €4 billion allocated to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses", the statement of reasons reads.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment we create income (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as we explain".
'It shall be entered in the budget and used as required.'
The SGP estimates that it will start receiving the 4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised 4 billion is not included in the credit, can trigger a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks thing has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's take it one step at a time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" US revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and the sinisterly ridiculous profile of Khadafi has long been giving cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The norm that secret files should only be made up of publicly known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those who engage in occultism not only trust what they already know, which reaffirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I know, the editor of Libération) is lazy (or has little desire), who only considers true what he can acknowledge.
Top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome was sending to the State Department was the same as the Newsweek report the week before.
So why have the disclosures of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they are just saying what every educated person knows already, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since Heads of State can call or fly to dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some limited representation exercises, have become spy centres.
Any viewer who watches investigative films knows perfectly well, only we pretend we don't know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad impression of American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can access the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal therefore affects both victims and "dwarfs".
But let's get into the true nature of what happened.
In the days of Orwell, he could be thought of as a mighty Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that not even the secrets of power can escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the citizens' avenger) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer keep its own secrets stand?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all her power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and a lot, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information online, as it would be like posting it on a street sign.
But it is also clear that with current technologies, you cannot expect to keep confidential conversations on the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State has travelled by plane and contacted one of his counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and therefore novel, but I imagine government agents who travel discreetly on diligently uncontrollable routes, carrying messages that have been learned by heart or, at best, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then stored in a single copy in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I've written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has again created a cable telegraph (telephone).
Video tapes (analog) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of the setup, whereas now digital CDs only allow for moving forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, in enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, whereas by plane, with the travel that comes with it, we need three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication techniques to bring us back to horse-drawn carriages.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was being secretly plotted in the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: France's splashes in its pledges of financing
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine whether the promises of rapidly unlocked financing (called fast start or early start) made by developed countries have been met.
And the French splashes have been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has committed to contribute EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.260 million (i.e. 420 million a year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the measures taken by its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was a remarkable achievement and was appreciated for what it really was worth: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to deliver on its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Accord, money must be 'new and additional' to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed a harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, each person chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added over three years as fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development aid.
France, on the other hand, considers that the financing of 'all new projects' in 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words, it does not refer to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of aid from France to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) as long as it is intended to respect its commitment to 'new and additional' funds...
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that every euro borrowed equals a donated euro.
This is obviously difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often emission reduction projects based on more efficient technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro to be recovered as the equivalent of a euro given... At most, only the cost of the loan to the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be calculated for its commitments.
But France finds this reasoning unhelpful: it "respects" its €420 million commitment by making 91.5% of loans (€389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (€36.1 million); see the EU document for your own eyes.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it at 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to meet its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort comparable.
That's a good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions over time and, on the other hand, in relation to the actual financial effort.
Spending just 36.1 million euros, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", just as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has been the arbitrator) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is a brief, relatively short-term, detail of the whole climate negotiations.
But it could be a grain of sand in the huge machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not like that.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012 with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could advance the debate on the stakes in long-term financing (another essential chapter being discussed at present): we will not get rid of the question of the 'additional character' or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore hope that the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its view of the 'additional character' and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the negotiations.
Warning against pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (the old rights and respect movement for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no statistical significance given the limited number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problematic treatment", purchased in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the food that a ten-year-old child typically consumes at four meals and one tentempié a day.
These model meals, which comply with official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three parts of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as candy, were tested in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the table is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five are classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EDs), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although in virtually all cases the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE pollutants is of concern", the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible cancer residues and three considered safe cancer residues, as well as about a dozen residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a school tent tent, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the Kenyan green juveniles, included in the food, in which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna, and even bread or gum were all adhered to pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analyses found the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon rod was the most "nutritious" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The end-risk of these "polluting cocktails" to consumers "is likely to be underestimated", says the study.
The European Ecology-Green Alliance (EE-LV) has proposed that, "in view of the gravity of the situation", a moratorium on the use of pesticides be applied to curb "the rise of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of 365 different pesticide residues identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 were in cereals.
