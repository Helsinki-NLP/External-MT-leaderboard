When we are about to die, we shall be alone. Of all our earthly possessions we shall be about to depart. Of earthly friends - the friends who point out to us our position, our wealth or our social qualities - we shall be leaving when we enter the valley of darkness. Of those bound to us by the strongest bonds - our relatives, our loved ones, our children, our brothers, our sisters, and others no less dear to us who have been made our friends because they and we are friends of the same Savior - of them we must also depart. Though not all will leave us. It is to be "lost more than a brother" - One who having loved His own who are in the world, loves them to the end.
