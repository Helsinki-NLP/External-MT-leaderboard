This confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a popular theory, but it also provides details like color and three-dimensional layout that you can't get from fossils.
According to scientists, the animal's fur was brownish on the top and light or carotene-colored on the bottom.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed trunk called the stamen, but had other features of feathers - rays and rays - scientists concluded that the stamen was probably a later evolutionary stage than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or display, and scientists believe that they are the feathers of an adult, not a chicken, even though the tail belonged to a young dinosaur.
Researchers suggested that although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the feathering of the specimen indicated an adult, not a chick.

This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, with the courts believing that publishing a photograph can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that journalists are entering dangerous territory by publishing photos of suspects and so on.
The Royal Commission, which is responsible for the investigation, has told reporters that no further comment is being made at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will be about the disputed borders that Palestine wants to restore to the state before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, a holy city for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years after the agreement is signed, and the AP only agrees to a five-year military presence.
The shooters participating in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by the foresters as the test was monitored and assessed for effectiveness.
The NPWS and the NSW Sport Shooting Federation (ASFF) have partnered to recruit qualified volunteers for the NSW Sport Shooting Federation hunting programme.
Mick O'Flynn, NPSW Park Conservation and Heritage Director, believes the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received comprehensive safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission requested the dissolution of the former Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to speed up new elections in the country.
The Commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests have been a blow to the lack of elections, blocked in some cases since 2011.
More than 60 cases of iPod malfunctions due to overheating have been reported, which has caused six fires and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, classifying them as "non-hazardous".
When Apple delayed the release of the report, the Ministry called it "very unfortunate".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Crisis Management Office said there was no damage to the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A bus carrying tourists from Hong Kong was hijacked in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, by a former Philippine police officer who took the passengers hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 rifle at the tourists.
So far, several hostages have been rescued and at least six are presumed dead.
The Filipino photographers and six hostages, including children and elderly, were released earlier.
And then the photographers took the place of an old woman who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins used his free time to start research on preterm birth.
His study showed that introducing the hormone would speed up the development of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua News Agency reported that on Wednesday, government investigators recovered the black boxes.
The wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tomy Dreamer said, "The Moon was the first Extreme Queen, she died on the night of two moons, which was as special as she was.
Dustin Gold Runnels said Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... one can only hope she's better now.
A survey of 1,400 people was conducted ahead of the 2010 federal election, and the percentage of people opposed to a republic in Australia increased by 8% compared to 2008.
The overseeing Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic with the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of respondents agree and want Queen Elizabeth to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme points of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but as he complained about his form, doubts were raised about his expected results.
The medication he needed to relieve the pain was forbidden by the rules of the Games, so he couldn't take it.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
By early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets brought water to Earth along with organic matter that could make proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to learn more about the formation of planets, especially what it looked like for Earth, which was struck by comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political babble and nonsense".
There's been a lot of speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
The use of satellite technology instead of older-generation radar technology allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
There will be no additional transport options, no underground trains will stop at Wembley, and in addition, car parks and park-and-ride facilities will be unavailable in the ground space.
The potential lack of transportation made it likely that the game would be played behind closed doors without the participation of the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands, which belong to Ecuador.
Scientists at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have announced that a new species has been formed in just two generations, although the process was thought to take much longer by breeding Darwin's tooth, black darwin, cactus darwin, and coarse darwin.
Gold can be shaped into many shapes, even the smallest.
It can be stretched into a thin piece of wire that can be twisted and braided, and it can be unfolded or shredded onto sheets.
It can be spread thinly and glued to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
We call this the pH of a chemical, and red cabbage juice has the ability to detect pH.
The color of cabbage juice varies according to how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H for pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (a hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders and squeeze them together with clean, wet hands to form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every home had a flush toilet connected to a modern sewer system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also common in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women shared.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
The call reaches a satellite in space, and then bounces back almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes placed in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts the light, thus distorting the image seen from Earth.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in many amazing ways, but most of all, it has made transportation much easier and faster.
Without it, there would be no railroad, no automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below average size are cats that feed on medium-sized prey: rabbits, antelopes, deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat many more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the niche, in a special task that each cat performs, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are among the most sociable cats and live in large herds.
A lion herd consists of one, two or three related adult males and up to 30 females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related to each other, forming one large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion groups behave similarly to wolf packs or herds of dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior and the lethal threat they pose to their prey.
A well-built athlete can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times faster than a strong man.
The tiger, along with the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, belong to the genus Panthera, and only these four species of cats can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not as loud as that of a lion, but it is more like a tangled, shouted word.
The ocelots prey on small animals, and when they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, and most of the ocelot's victims are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find food by smell.
They're very good at seeing in the dark because of their night vision and they're very stealthy, hunting their prey, blending in with the environment and then jumping on the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (e.g. when moving over a mountain range or river or if moving to a new island, without the possibility of easy withdrawal), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to develop new traits or adapt in a way that will allow them to compete effectively in their new environment.
The original population hasn't changed a bit and still has to adapt.
As the new population adapts to the new environment, they become less and less like other populations.
After all, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different from one another that it will be difficult to call them one species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable part of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen for humans to breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (exhale).
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to produce nutrients and shade.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, and most of our food is also from plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
Mozazaur was the largest predator of his time, so he was only afraid of other mozazaurs.
It had over 70 extremely sharp teeth in its elongated jaws, and the extra teeth protruded from the canopy, so the victims had no chance of coming into contact with it.
We can't be sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, maybe even a cannibal.
He didn't back down from attacking his victims in the water, and even a dinosaur as huge as T. rex must have felt respect for him.
While most of the foods that the Romans ate are familiar, they also feasted on quite exotic foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and leeches.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate at tables while the rich met at banquets, where they ate in a reclining position.
The food of ancient Rome could not contain ingredients that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not know corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
In Babylon, each deity had a temple dedicated to him, which was considered his home.
Sacrifices to the gods were offered by humans, and the priests were responsible for providing for divine needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard with an inner sanctuary that was open only to the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were erected, which became part of the temples.
A special sanctuary dedicated to the god was located on top of the tower.
The home was not a particularly important part of the warm climate of the Middle East.
Most of the Hebrew family life was outdoors.
Women prepared food in their backyards, shops were simple rooftops facing the street, and stones were used to build houses.
Since the land of Canaan was not heavily forested, the price of wood was very high.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and according to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his journey west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
While not diminishing his role as an explorer, it is noteworthy that the area was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes at that time.
While each country could be described as "Scandinavian", Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differ in people, rulers, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Nations, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence has a map of the way to the treasure.
There's some writing on the back of the document, but it's not a treasure map.
On the second page of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776".
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that this large parchment document (measuring 29.75 by 24.5 inches) was originally encased for storage.
It can therefore be assumed that the annotation was added as a descriptive label.
The Normandy landings and further fighting led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still under occupation.
The French Vichy regime was in charge, and these were the people from France who made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the aggressors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France, which was called Operation Dragoon.
It took two weeks for the U.S. and Free French forces to liberate southern France and move on to Germany.
A civilization is one culture shared by a fairly large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, or civic, which is related to civis, or citizen, and civitas, or city or city-state, which also in some way indicates the size of the community.
The city-states were the prototypes of nations, and the culture of civilization is the transmission of knowledge across generations, the preservation of cultural traces and the equitable distribution of knowledge.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind any significant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states first established a fragile central government  whose only component was Congress  based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no taxing power, and with no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state governments, which often failed to cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
Furthermore, he had no authority to overturn laws and tax rates between states.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all states before any changes could be made, and the states treated the central government with such contempt that their representatives often did not come forward.
Alongside Germany, the Italian national football team is ranked second in the world in the football rankings, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italian athletes participate in international tournaments and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands it possesses, Japan is often called the  archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors who passed through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, which means "beautiful island".
When the Dutch East India Company established a factory in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, it began to implement changes in indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese workers in the rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, handing Taiwan over to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Within Machu Picchu, three main structures stand out: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
To better reflect the original appearance of the site to visitors, most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been remodeled.
By 1976, one third of the city of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the process is still ongoing.
For example, in photography, the most common format used is 35 mm, the most common size of film tape at the end of the analogue era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, this image format has been ported to matrix formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high, which is quite confusing.
So the ratio in this format (we're dividing by 12 to get the simplest total ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS group) are identical or closely resemble this ratio.
The rule of thirds is often misused or ridiculed, but it provides a simple guideline for achieving dynamism without disrupting order.
It states that the ideal location for the main object is the point of intersection of the lines dividing the image into three equal parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, came under close scrutiny.
For more than a millennium, the Christian religion provided a vital link between European nations with different languages and customs.
His power was so overwhelming that it affected everyone from the king to the peasant.
A central tenet of Christianity is that wealth should be used to help the suffering and the poor and that church funds should be used for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money makes one wonder whether this doctrine is being followed.
Soon after the outbreak of war, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy effectively cut off key military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law enshrined in several international agreements made over the previous two centuries.
Britain mined areas of international waters to block ships from entering vast swathes of the ocean, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
This tactic met with limited response, so the Germans expected a similar situation for their ruthless underwater warfare operations.
The 20th century was marked by a pacifist and isolationist attitude among most nations and citizens.
After the terrible and cruel experiences of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla settled in the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York.
He set foot on American soil with a quarter in his pocket, a volume of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods were shown in a unique way; each stage in China or each ruling family constituted a separate dynasty.
In the transitional periods between dynastic rule, the provinces were mired in turmoil and division, the most famous being the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Many notables who claimed the throne fought fiercely during these periods.
The Three Kingdoms period was recorded in ancient Chinese history as a period of great bloodshed; thousands of people died fighting for the supreme throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not just to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, all male candidates were also given free access to the professions, allowing those with the greatest ambition and resourcefulness to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because the ranking of armies that used to be based on class is now based on the sword.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start a revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond his ordinary life, and he often went to contemplate in a cave known as Hira on Mount Noor (Mountain of Light).
The cave itself gives a very colorful insight into the spiritual predilections of Muhammad.
The cave, located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the outside world.
It's not easy to find, even if someone knows it exists.
There's nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and from inside the cave, you can't see or hear much of the outside world.
The only one of the seven wonders of the world that has survived to this day is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramids erected in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau (also called the Giza Necropolis) in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The up symbol looks like the letter V, and the down symbol looks like a clamp or a square without a bottom.
Up means you start at the tip and you press the leash, and down means you start at the top of the frog (where the hand holds the leash) and you pull the leash.
Moving the string from bottom to top produces a softer sound, and moving the string from top to bottom produces a stronger, more determined sound.
Feel free to draw your own characters, but remember that the printed characters on the string are there for musical purposes, so you should usually stick to them.
The enraged mob of bribes forced frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoine, their two children (11 - year - old Marie-Thérèse and 4 - year - old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Elisabeth, to return from Versailles to Paris.
As the king and queen rode back to Paris in their carriage, they were accompanied by a screaming mob threatening them.
The angry mob forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd nodded to the head of a guard who had been killed in Versailles, right in front of the terrified queen.
The imperialist war expenses of the United States for the conquest of the Philippines were covered by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on bonds listed on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the great profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would be the primary profits of US imperialism.
The context in which the Templar Order was formed is important to understanding its specifics.
These events belong to the era commonly called the Late Middle Ages, which spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (1000-1300 C.E.).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism encompasses a wide range of ideas applied in practice, including technological impulse or technological imperative, as well as a strict determination of human destiny guided by the hidden logic of scientific law and its manifestation in the field of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism combine two general principles: first, the process of technological development itself is not subject to cultural or political factors, and second, technology generates effects in societies that are immanent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of the road network.
Since a national road network is not economically viable when the number of vehicles is negligible, new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of operating a vehicle.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to increased road accidents, and thus  to new medical inventions to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained an important element of cultural determinism, which can be found in the writings of Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, individuals were shaped by geography, and over time, customs and cultures associated with that geography developed, so in tune with the place of society that they were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is now known as the modern fashion capital, so Constantinople was once known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a luxury resort began around 400 AD and lasted until 1000 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely because returning Crusaders brought back such goods as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than what was offered at Byzantine markets.
It was then that the title of fashion capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
But because the exchange of information was slow, Western styles could develop 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest achievements of the Crusades was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient farming is when a farmer produces enough food to feed himself and his family.
Self-sufficient farming is a simple, often organic system using self-sufficient seed from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively easy methods of maximising yield.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures attract people with similar worldviews, people who feel that social norms don't meet their needs, people who find a sense of identity within a subculture.
Subcultures are diverse in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture in its distinctiveness may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or may be a combination of different factors.
If you're a member of a subculture, you show it through an expressive and symbolic style that includes fashion, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most popular ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their adolescence  whether due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate exploitation.
Some of these children were imprisoned (usually by their parents) and some were abandoned because their parents were unable to cope with their child's severe mental or physical disability.
Before being abandoned or fled, wild children may have suffered trauma or abuse.
Others are thought to have bred animals, and some are said to live alone in the wild.
If a savage child is cared for only by animals, he will behave almost entirely (including physical limitations) like those animals, showing fear or indifference toward humans.
The design method should make learning easier and more attractive, while scaffolding goes one step further.
The scaffolding method is not a way of learning, but rather a support provided to people who are participating in new educational experiences, e.g. using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual and real, which means that the teacher is a kind of scaffolding, just like Mr. Clipper in MS Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in software and is intended to challenge, suggest and explain procedures that a student may find challenging to understand on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even coercion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that does not provide them with upbringing, care and education, but unfortunately, that is what happens.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our substitute care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and good medical care.
The foster family is to provide for any needs that were not met in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet can be used for both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet open up new dimensions in terms of how it is used and how it is rewarded.
For example, 'learning' and 'connecting with others' are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and lasting relationships were also identified by Eighemey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined audience responses to websites.
Video recordings have made important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, or facial muscle movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that you can detect whether a person is lying by reading their microexpressions correctly.
In an article entitled "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks argues that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to correctly judge the sincerity of the speaker.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may also be present in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Scientific research over the course of the 20th century has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: one hidden and one expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes variation from the pool of expressed genes.
With each generation, there is a reciprocal exchange of variability between the two pools through segregation and recombination.
Plants growing on the savannah have a hard time allowing primates with digestive systems like humans to meet their body's amino acid requirements.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins in leaves and stems, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest without cooking.
It is different with animal food (ants, termites, eggs), which is easily digested and provides high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their protein problem in a similar way to how chimpanzees do it today on the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the intentional awakening during normal sleep and falling back asleep after 10 to 60 minutes.
It's not difficult if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores consciousness but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get up and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based methods recommend consuming plenty of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, which is diuretic) to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace is inversely proportional to the person's inner and physical tension.
The less stress, the more positive the life force, and each person has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it also includes the Mahayana path of love and numerous Indian yoga techniques.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, and it's made up of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga awakens the kundalini energy (or energy of enlightenment) through the practice of asanas, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity, through which the visualization of the various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates the consciousness of enlightenment.
During World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union allied against a common enemy, Germany, but by the end of the war, a radical clash of systems, processes, and cultures had divided the two nations.
It's been two years since the end of the war, when former allies became enemies, ushering in the Cold War.
It was to last for the next 40 years and include real battles fought by the proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By 17 September 1939, Polish defences were broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian front.
However, these plans were quickly abandoned when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers formed a Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading eastern Poland, violating the provisions of the Russo-Polish Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping is by far the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of goods and people across the oceans.
The Navy's mission has always been to provide a country with the ability to transport people and goods while preventing the enemy from moving its people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign of World War II was one of the most famous examples in recent history, when the Americans tried to help the British by moving men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy, using submarines primarily, tried to block these transmissions.
If the Allies had failed, the Germans would probably have conquered Britain, as they would the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats probably took place in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
People from ancient cultures and tribes started to raise them for their milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often guarded by shepherd-like goat herders, usually children or teenagers.
Railways were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the track was built on parallel wooden planks, the horses could move faster and carry larger loads than on the then-curved roads.
Rail-mounted platforms appeared relatively early, but it was gradually realized that to improve the performance of the rails, iron strips had to be fitted.
This became a popular practice, but the iron contributed to the increased wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known way to move was to walk; humans began walking upright two million years ago, hence the term Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, were not used to walking upright.
Two-legged forms can be found in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is not excluded that the Sahelanthropus moved on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the green movement, and we can even take on the role of activists to do something to reduce the scale of suffering in the future.
Often, this is similar to symptomatic treatment, but rather than just a temporary solution, you need to identify the source of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of scientific and technological advances, and overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles have exacerbated the problems.
When the Declaration of Independence was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten version signed by John Hancock, Speaker of Congress, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
At night, 150 to 200 copies were printed, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he ordered it read to his troops on July 9 in New York City.
The 25 Dunlap bulbs that still exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived.
Many paleontologists claim that there was one group of dinosaurs that survived until today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that remind us of dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs, just like T-Rex.
In fact, all the computers we use today are based on manipulating information encoded as a binary system.
A binary number can have a value of 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are so common that they do not warrant immediate diagnosis.
The presence of an open container of medicinal products or toxic industrial chemicals is the best indication of poisoning.
Read the label instructions to learn how to give first aid in this particular case.
The name worm is the formal name used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from ancient times, when bugs were familiar, highly adapted insects that parasitize on humans.
Both bedbugs and house bugs are nest-dwelling creatures, adapted to live in a nest or in a host's home.
There are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies show that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or that of the child.
These couples can decide to make an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption is when the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can be the parents of the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to discover how the world works by using the scientific method, which is the basis of most scientific research.
However, this is not the only method; an experiment is a test that allows one or more possible hypotheses to be rejected.
The classical texts, especially the Latin Bible, provided the basis for the studies of naturalists and philosophers.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend fundamentally on the existence of endogenous cycles and their creation by biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms other than reactions to periodic external stimuli have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to cycle even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the same bacteriophages or viruses to implant bacteria's own DNA.
Two experiments were performed, one to mark DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus and the other to mark phage protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on their type, the importance of the genetic material involved and whether the cells involved are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children; mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in exploring natural areas, admiring landscapes, including flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visits to parks and ecosystem information gathering.
For example, visiting Borneo, taking pictures and learning about orangutans.
Every morning, people drive out of their small towns and go to work, passing by people who are going to the places they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is somehow participating in and supporting the private vehicle transport system.
Now, science shows that a massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of its stable state, which for two million years supported human evolution.
Everyone is a participant in society and uses transport.
In developed lands, such complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges are rare.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, why are there problems with them every day, are the engineers responsible for them just a bunch of tramps, or is there something much deeper?
Road traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, there is no way to predict drivers' behavior with 100% certainty, so it is difficult to study traffic flow.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers is in a broadly consistent range; therefore, traffic flows also show some consistency and can be approximated by mathematical calculations.
The relationships between three key properties, namely (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed, allow a better picture of road traffic.
The planning, design and operation of road facilities exploit these types of relationships.
Insects were the first animals to soar in the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the useful ability to fold their wings along the trunk.
This gives them a greater choice of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that do not have the ability to fold their wings are the quail and the hedgehog.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, while others held the opposite view, that the solar system, including the sun and other stars, revolves around the earth.
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest river in the world, and it's also the largest river in the world, carrying eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, reaching nearly six miles wide in places.
The Amazon is responsible for 20 percent of the water from the rivers that feed the world's oceans.
The Amazon is 6387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long at its main course and is fed by thousands of small tributaries.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramids.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom looked with admiration at the buildings of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent state in the world and also the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Most workers in Italy speak Italian on a daily basis, and Latin is often spoken during religious ceremonies.
All the people in the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they occur in nature in their natural form and can be extracted relatively easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a combination of at least one of the four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter, in that order: solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also had theories about how they could be turned into new substances that would shape what we see.
An alloy can be defined as a mixture of two or more metals.
Calcium and potassium are elements that are considered metals, and of course, silver and gold are also metals.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, e.g. carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly microscopic that the dot at the end of this task would hold trillions of them.
So when the pencil came along, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new ways of writing pencils, it has lost its status and its frequency of use.
People now write news using computer screens and don't need a timer at all.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to connect a nucleus with many protons and neurons.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and the core splitting releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that decay with or without a slight impact.
The surface of the moon is covered with rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the planet is called the crust.
The cover is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner below the lunar seas and thicker below the highlands.
There may be more areas of lava on the visible side, because the crust is less thick here and the lava was easier to break through to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what resonates with people and appeals to them.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been acquired during the process of maturing into adulthood.
These theories are about what makes some people want what they do and what in their environment makes them do certain things and not others.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start to lead their former colleagues, two types of behaviour can occur.
This type of manager is reluctant to make unpopular decisions, avoids disciplinary actions, and avoids evaluating performance, assigning tasks, and holding people accountable for their work.
The other extreme is the unrecognizable transformation into someone who feels like they have to change everything the band has done, subjugate it to their own vision.
After all, it is the leader who is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often creates friction between the leader and the other team members.
The same standards of excellence apply to virtual teams, but there are slight differences.
Members of the virtual team often act as a contact point for a physical group directly linked to them.
They often have more freedom than regular team members because their teams can organize meetings according to different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
Invisible Group is a management team to which all members are subject.
What would make a company want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity flourish when all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of the organisation.
As a result, working together within an organisation to overcome a barrier can lead to an innovative process that meets customer needs.
For an organisation to be innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that helps organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, which narrows the scope and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supported by ongoing scientific research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, injury, injury and tumor affect behavior and lead to changes in mental function.
New technologies allow us to observe and study previously unknown brain structures and processes.
We're getting a lot of information and material from this to build simulation models that allow us to better understand what's going on in the human mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research is about building machines to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples include: control and planning, the ability to respond to customer statements and questions, and character recognition of handwriting, voice, and facial expressions.
These things have become separate fields, focused on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering and military technology, and is also present as an embedded component in several applications used in personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of every classroom activity, and often a teacher would be happy to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology allows for virtual field trips, where students can see museum collections, visit an aquarium or admire artwork from their classroom.
By sharing the field trip in a virtual mode, you can stimulate reflection on it and share experiences with the next classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the website changes, but the old versions stay online as an album.
Blogs can help students improve their writing skills, and often when they start blogging, their grammar and spelling are not at their best, but the presence of readers usually changes that.
Blogger is starting to make an effort to improve the quality of his writing and avoid criticism, because students often fail the most stringent grades.
In addition, blogging helps students to learn more about the world around them.The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to offer intelligent and interesting content (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool to inspire collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Through the proper use of blogs, students can become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to web posts, they can define their own position on other people's work and outline their own perspective on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada, with many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south of here are Niagara Falls, and to the north, the pristine beauty of Muskoka County and surrounding regions.
All of these things, and not just these things, clearly indicate that Ontario is considered by outsiders to be the quintessence of Canada.
The vast areas further north are sparsely populated, some of them virtually unpopulated wilderness.
This comparison of populations surprises many: The number of African Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, east of the African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and it is a separate continent in nature.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or allies of France and are famous as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which was firmly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influences and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should pose as a married person, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (if it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behaviors that they consider harassment, often involving stalking, holding hands, etc.
Be firm and say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't mean you can!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century B.C.E. by Berber fishermen and served the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenites as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badya, and the Spanish traders who had trading posts there named it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is the last place in all of Morocco.
Traditional Moroccan goods such as tadjins, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a variety of trinkets can be easily bought in the old Medina, but this is a typical tourist offer.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge of the country near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted and lava buried most of the city's streets, especially its center.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside its territory should be pre-screened against the current state of fighting in North Kivu province.
From the city, you can go hiking on Nyiragongo Volcano and mountain gorilla tracking, which is one of the cheapest options for this attraction in Africa.
Motorcycle taxis (known as boda-boda) can be used to get around Goma, and the standard (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
In the context of its relatively difficult location, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for exotic and remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, yet it has a reputation for attracting tourists and an airport.
In 1990 the city was placed on the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the destruction caused by desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on the Henry Louis Gates PBS special "African Wonder of the World".
This city is definitely different from other cities in the country because it has a more Arab than African climate.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions with a variety of flora and fauna.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
There are daily security and entrance fees, as in all other South African national parks.
Purchasing a wild card can be beneficial, as it allows you to enter selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from Hong Kong Island, which is the main attraction for many tourists.
The narrow rows of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong were compared to the brilliant bar chart of Victoria Bay.
The best views of Hong Kong are from the Kowloon waterfront, across the city.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place that was occupied by British colonists, so it's worth starting here to look for traces of the colonial past of this territory.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest strip of mangrove forest, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast into Bangladesh and parts of India.
The Sundarbans are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and part of the forest is called Sundarban National Park.
But the forests are not just swampy meadows  they are also the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Hindustan Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water and wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary and is now thought to house 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 tigers.
Buses leave from the Inter-Regional Bus Station (across the river) throughout the day, although most depart between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading east and to Jakaru/Bumthang.
It is better to buy a ticket a few days in advance, since buses that run between the neighborhoods are often crowded.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable and durable Japanese shore buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of transport to nearby places, e.g. Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two 3.5 metre wide lanes.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 metres and was completed in August 2011, but was not opened until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be ready for use in September 2017, when the construction of the Brazilian customs posts is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living a semi-nomadic life of hunting and farming to support themselves.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Province of India", was founded in the 16th century as a result of a conflict between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and the best players in the world.
In December, the largest tournament of the year is held at the polo courts in Las Cañitas.
Other months include smaller tournaments and contests.
The Asociación Argentina de Polo offers more information on the tournaments and tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands that can change money is the one in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
Payments in British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, credit cards are available at Stanley, and US dollars are often available.
Card payments are not available on the outermost islands, although British and American currencies may be accepted; it is best to ask the owners in advance for a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so you must exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is there when winter is in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, which means that temperatures often exceed +30°C in the summer months.
Winters can be colder than you think: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but when combined with wind and humidity, the feeling of cold is greater than the thermometer shows.
There are no rainy or dry seasons, the rainfall is basically the same all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to human presence, they are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend that you keep at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wildlife!
Although they may appear gentle, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these are large, wild, potentially dangerous animals that need space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and home to fewer than 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1950's and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
It was here that the infamous sea-blockade of 1889 occurred when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, killing nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town ended with the murder of Tupua's main leader, Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland is sandwiched between two bays, so there are plenty of beaches here, and the most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy, with safe bathing areas, and most are shaded by metrosideros.
Tamaki Drive Beaches is located in Waitemata Bay, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Auckland city centre.
They are often crowded, family beaches with a wide variety of shops filling the waterfront.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complicated beer but a pleasant and refreshing one.
It's worth stocking up on a variety of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited to the journey.
You can drink tap water here without any worries, but if you are in doubt, you can easily find bottled water.
The concept of "flat white" is foreign to Australians, whereas "black" is espresso, cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian-standard, and fruit juices are expensive, but they're delicious.
Many reef expeditions take place year-round, and reef injuries caused by any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, be aware of all the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cuckoo occurs near beaches and river outlets from October to April, north of 1770.
No one denies the existence of sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most of these creatures are afraid of contact with humans and swim away.
Rosary crocodiles do not live in the oceans, their primary habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance means that travelers do not have to worry about having a place to sleep when they arrive.
Travel agencies usually work with specific hotels, although it is possible to book another form of accommodation, such as camping, with a travel agent.
The travel agencies offer packages that include breakfast, transport from/to the airport, and combined flight and hotel packages.
The booking can be extended for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents you need at the destination (e.g. a visa).
Any corrections or requests should go to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, most of whom consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be near the action, you have to get there early to find a campsite near the music.
Please note that even after the main stage performances have finished, music will continue to play until late at night in some areas of the festival.
Some festivals offer campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as traveling through the ice generates terrible noise for those most affected.
The travel time to St. Petersburg is included in the trip.
Casinos usually want their guests to stay as long as possible and leave as much money as possible, which is why there are no windows and no clocks, and it's hard to find a way out.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests entertained and at home.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the house, but drunkenness is a judgmental habit, and all hard-core gamblers know the value of a sober mind.
When driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes, consideration should be given to conditions such as snow, ice and sub-zero temperatures.
The roads covered with ice and snow have little friction, so it is not possible to drive as on clean asphalt.
When a blizzard hits, it can quickly snow so much that the road becomes impassable.
Rain or wind, or dripping snow or ice on the windows, can also limit visibility.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries where traffic is free all year round.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important event for many visitors.
Safari is a popular term for land trips to the beautiful African countryside, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are often approached by cars, and standard equipment will allow for proper viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy, so it's best to watch them through binoculars.
Walking safaris can last from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will start on August 24 and run until September 5, 2012, with some events being hosted at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice (the first time was in 1964).
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the reschedule was announced, you may be in a difficult position.
The rules for cancellations vary, but at the end of March, most cancellations due to coronavirus did not include July 2020, when the Olympic Games were due to be held.
As expected, most event tickets will range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Ironing can speed up the drying of wet clothes, and many hotels will rent irons and ironing boards if they are not available in the room.
If you do not have a hair iron or do not feel comfortable wearing socks that are ironed, you may try using a hairdryer if available.
The fabric must not be overheated as it may shrink or burn in extreme cases.
There are many ways to treat water, and some are more effective at reducing certain hazards.
Depending on the area, the water may boil for a minute or take several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, so if you are concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests that are not found in their native countries.
Pests destroy food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, release venom, and transmit infections.
Pests are not usually classified as infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans.
Duty-free purchases provide an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at specific locations.
Travelers to countries with particularly high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on such goods as alcohol and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, the most difficult stretch for drivers is between Point Marion and Fairmont, often traversing remote wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes on the road, as you will often encounter steep climbs, narrow sections, and sharp turns.
The speed limits indicated are much lower than those applicable on the preceding and subsequent sections (usually 3540 mph, or 5664 km/h), and strict adherence to them is of the utmost importance.
But the interesting thing is that the cell phone network here has a much stronger signal than many other parts of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite tasty, and Bavarian ones are noted for their nutrition and variety, as are those in Austria, which borders Bavaria to the south.
Fruit cakes are very popular: with boiled apples available all year round, and with cherries and plums in the summer.
Many German pastries include almonds, walnuts, and other nuts, and popular cookies often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but nutritious meal, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either dried or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland northern regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is a common addition to curry dishes, while coconut milk is used in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With as many as 17,000 islands, the term Indonesian cuisine covers a wide variety of regional cuisines from all over the country.
This term, without further specification, usually refers to the cuisine typical of the central and eastern areas of Java, which is the most important island of the region.
Javanese cuisine, now readily available throughout the archipelago, includes simple spices, and Javanese favorites include peanuts, chili peppers, and various spices.
The saddle-rider's foot rests are suspended on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may cause safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's feet becoming trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and his foot becomes caught in the stirrup, the running horse can pull him up.
First of all, most jockeys wear riding boots with high heels and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially the English, have safety features that cause the saddle to drop if pulled by a rearward-falling rider.
Cochamó Valley  Chile's most important climbing location, referred to as the Yosemite of South America and offering a variety of large granite walls and towers.
The peaks offer spectacular views, and climbers from all over the world continue to make new paths through the walls of endless possibilities.
Winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve skiing on snow-covered terrain on foot-mounted skis or snowboards.
Skiing is a staple activity for many ski enthusiasts, sometimes called "Ski Fools", who plan their entire ski vacation in one place.
Skiing has a very long history  as far back as 5000 B.C.E. the cave walls were painted with figure skis!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened Australia's first recreational ski resort.
Skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski tours.
Although there are some similarities between alpine skiing and climbing, the route is not steep and requires no more sturdy skis or boots.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, you can cover somewhat longer distances than you would on foot, but you will rarely reach running speeds, provided you do not carry a heavy backpack and the route is properly prepared.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries, and under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean applying for many visas and having to go through many passport controls.
In this respect, the Schengen area functions to some extent as a single state.
As long as you are in this zone, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control points again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen country, saving you time and money and reducing formalities.
There is no universal definition of what works of art should be considered antiques, and some tax agencies consider antiques to be anything over 100 years old.
This definition depends on geographical location, the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Craft items can be called antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Many Sami people live off reindeer herding, and the culture associated with reindeer herding is also important for people in other professions.
The traditional occupation of the Sami people is not only large-scale reindeer farming but also fishing, hunting, etc., with reindeer primarily used as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work hard in modern industries, and tourism is an important part of the Sami economy.
The word Gypsy is commonly heard, especially among people who are not themselves Roma, but it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of Roma.
