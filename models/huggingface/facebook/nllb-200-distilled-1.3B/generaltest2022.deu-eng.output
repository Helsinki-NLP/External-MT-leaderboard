The goods were under 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a big customer and so it's not a problem for me.
All I need is a number or an instruction on what to attach to the package so you can track it as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG a few days ago... for 249 euros.
Today it costs 179 euros.
I find that very irritating, to be honest.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for a better price or is there another way to get credit?
I also think that children should not be forced to take on the role of parents for their younger siblings.
However, I feel that it is good for older brothers to share in caring for the younger ones.
Just look around, help out, bring the bottle, etc.
This teaches them responsibility, helpfulness, and involvement.
As long as they can be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is doing it alone for a short time and he's okay with it, that's fine.
You are the best judge of whether this is appropriate for your children.
It's not like he's gonna wrap up K2 and go to sleep for hours.
Legally, it's probably questionable.
Perhaps that's why the psychologist said so.
Because if something were to happen, like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that's a risk you want to take is, of course, your choice.
Please help me find the title of a book.
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole plot but I can't think of the title anywhere.
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a keeper commits suicide by showering himself with food and going to his cage to feed his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a police commissioner who, after a brief investigation, goes to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who's also afraid of fire and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there's another protagonist - a photographer who is assigned anonymously before each suicide to go to the scene of the suicide and document and post the photos on the Internet.
Anyway, it turns out that this therapist is running a kind of underground therapy group where the patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately allows the patients to confront their anxiety in the most extreme way possible.
(one woman jumps out of a window another drives herself to death)
This facing fear is what the book calls "the fight".
And then at the end, there's a big showdown at the hospital that had to do with a fire.
That's the crude plot. I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone knows this story or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, my God, I don't have the password to the Wi-Fi.
I'll have to contact my husband first.
It can take a while.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is there any way to get the difference in price refunded ?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wooden splinters under the thumbnail (outside) along its entire length.
Tried to pull him out with tweezers.
Very hard to reach.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining a digital decoder and a sound module on a circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotive of track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are available with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm sugar cube speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all members of the family, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He is proficient in the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are as self-explanatory as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
RailComPlus® enables the decoders to log in to a suitable digital centre automatically.
It has all the DCC programming modes and RailCom® allows the CV values on the main track to be read with the appropriate controls.
For centres that can only program the CVs from 1-255 there are help registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 staircases at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the activation of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also allows reprogramming with the venerable Control Unit 6021.

Johnson wants to push for a boost in immunization.
New cases of Omicron are increasingly causing political and scientific concern in Britain.
The Commission is therefore proposing that by the new year all eligible adults in England should be offered a vaccine.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress than previously planned on the coronavirus vaccination refresher programme, given the rapidly rising number of Omicron cases.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
The target date was the end of January.
The UK Government will also provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Omicron variant is an emergency and vaccine protection needs to be increased urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose.
"Let's get you boosting now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more Omicron cases were recorded in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared with the previous day, this was a whopping 65 percent increase.
Is the full amount of the purchase price refunded at pick-up?
I'm all for everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today, the invitation to an interview came in an e-mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I Googled it, and depending on where he/she comes from, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on the feet of an official.
So, everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have five books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had a hidden shortcoming in sales.
How else can a pad damage like this happen after nine months ?
I tried on #PRS_ORG.
But it 's been working for about a year .
14 days no more.
So I always bought the latest books on the website and then read on #PRS_ORG.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
But there were none left.
Now they're available again, and I want you to add two more chairs to the order and charge me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I'm going to write something a little bit more detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about my soul.
I (21) have more contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One of the things that really bugs me about this, and unfortunately it's all too common, is that many victims don't let themselves be helped or think we can't help them.
I'm quite aware that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than not being able to do anything about situations like this.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of snatching the children from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, some of whom are even close to tears, is that everyone deserves to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
It never gets easier.
Please, always remember, you are worthy of living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What makes the series "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a stunning setup: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" video game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP Ludwigsburg giants against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster John Patrick was reliable.
For the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost at Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back at the Pokal defeat at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October: "We still have some anger in our stomach".
The number of players who were not able to play after the game increased again after the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Bundesliga.
But more than the naked result, the way the performance was disappointing.
A statistic that illustrates the whole dilemma is representative: The three-way score was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young Johannes Patrick) in 31 tries - more questions?
John Patrick replied: "We simply weren't focused enough after the win at Tenerife and didn't implement what we trained for".
That's moving the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted differently: "It's a great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg", said the happy coach.
"It felt like it was in front of 10,000 people".
On Saturday, only 750 people were allowed into the Hohenlohe Arena, but they paid their own way.
Not least because of BBL's all-time leading scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team in scoring.
"The best game-maker I ever trained", Gleim said.
While in Patrick's team even the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and came up to eight points after already trailing 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon came in with 12 points.
Fortunately, there's not much time to argue.
The giants will host the Skyliners in Frankfurt on Wednesday at 7 p.m. and will also host a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different e-mail address, but I changed it.

Max Raabe is 59 years old
He is able to delight his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the programme "Good morning, good luck" - if he can perform.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it's not gonna work.
The scheduled concert has been moved to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the season of Advent will also have to be cancelled, as the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de) says.
From January, the artists will be able to catch up on their 2020 dates that were postponed due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot since he was a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his hit album "For Women That's No Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He's made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blonde hair combed back and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe is unthinkable in the current German-speaking music scene.
He has been on tour since 2020 with the program "Good day, dear happiness".
Hello #NAME#, is it possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?

Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing
The new Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing groups, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"A foreclosure does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure", Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the assurance that their rent will remain affordable for years to come.
A colourful mix of private landlords, cooperatives and housing associations is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the referendum result.
If the situation does not ease, however, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent-pricing brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and an increase in the rent level.
I'll talk to the Attorney General and get this done as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps", the SPD politician stressed.
Hello, I was about to order something and I realized after a few days that I forgot the last step of the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it 'll be back in stock ?
Or if it will ever come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great.
Then I 'll cash it myself on the new order .
Thank you for the quick clarification.
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will it take to ship?
I already cut my finger.
That is a complete and utter insolence.
At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept across the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there remind me of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes in the United States caused widespread destruction and may have killed up to a hundred people.
The storms are leaving behind a 200-mile-long (320-kilometer) slice of devastation, mostly in Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster area, that wherever the tornado hit, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings, just go.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that that's even possible.
He's estimating up to 100 deaths in Kentucky alone, with official figures rising by the hour.
Hey, I just saw she sold out of showcases.
That's too bad.
Is it still in production?
Or is it completely off the shelf?
Is it possible to order this case in another country?
When will you be in touch?
If the delivery can't be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item via the contact form and wanted to know if it had arrived or if it was being processed, as I had not received confirmation yet.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising
While the Federal Government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash bonuses for vaccination.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of vaccines in the EU.
The conversion of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to vaccinate against corona.
He moved to a company he slandered.
It doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't stick to his old job and went looking for something else.
You can too.
And that he didn't like you back then, well, whatever.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That's gonna be legally relevant.
I'm making a screenshot.

Help for first own campaign
Boron to the greeting!
I'm currently directing the Grip Pass Adventure for a group of four friends and I want to seamlessly guide my heroes into a campaign specifically designed for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big story arc is done, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are worked out, and now I'm in the process of writing the entry-level adventure, and I'm stumbling on my own feet on the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to take a wheat cart from the ridge to a small village near Lake Thuran.
That's where the rest of the story is going to take place.
A few miles from the village, the hero is to be ambushed by a group of goblins and lured into an ambush.
I want to give the characters the ability to deal with the confrontation in different ways: persuade, act, threaten, detect danger early, whatever players can think of.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and swords
In case of no-show, the goblins will ambush the hero in a hollow and flank the carriage with three arches to the left and three to the right, while two will stop the carriage with spears.
If the battle comes and the heroes fall, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all unconscious and then found and cured by the village schoolboy's half-elf son.
The cart is gone, of course.
If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf will intervene with two of his servants to help the hero in battle.
The cart's still there, everything's fine.
How appropriate do you think the Deus ex Machina of Solution 2 is?
Is the encounter too much to begin with?
The Goblin group will play a crucial role later on, so it's not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm sure I'll take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narrative.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put it back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That 's why I 'd still like to send her back .
Can you send the return tickets, then I can pack the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#.

Suddenly the crack was there.
I just sat on it.
And here was the bottom part, so basically the storage part was damaged.
Will they pick up everything or just the storage part?
I 'm bored with Sky Sport F1
Hello, F1 fans, over the season the quality of the German Sky has been decreasing, so I'm going to take a breath with this post.
For one thing, today, in the middle of the F2 race, the broadcast was canceled to allow the F1 preview to start on time.
Although the delayed start and the start accident left the schedule far behind schedule, the last ten minutes (planned) and the championship decision could still have been shown.
But it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and must therefore limit everything else, so Sky DE had no choice here.
Still, it's stupid, especially since Sky UK is broadcasting the race to the end.
Nevertheless, I would like to commend the commentator Olivier Zwartyes for his good reporting on the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident.
Then in F1 there was again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so neither knew that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although there was this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen should change tyres when there were corresponding radio speeches to Hamilton on the subject.
Both Sky UK and RTL commentators knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen.
I think you should know these basic rules when you comment on F1 on pay-TV.
It is not the first time that we have been puzzled by what is possible or required by the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties about the rules.
I don't like Roos's artificial style of commentary in general, but admit it's a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant nonsense that make both seem simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter, in particular, is causing a great deal of unease in the comment, which he does not seem to take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising is simply taking over at Sky, in the round of 16 Sky is the only station that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV since only the German soundtrack has to get by without comment right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing that.
The two channels also advertise less in training than Sky, and this as a free-to-air channel.
While I must commend Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programme is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language station to broadcast F1.
Ironically, RTL is doing a better job of advertising the four races they're still allowed to broadcast.
So anyway, the grand F1 season is far less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I'd like to know what you think.
On this one: #PRS_ORG# pendulum, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I've contacted the chat room twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on the 12th of December, 1919.
One of them showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front of the chair).
I'm asking for backup.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplementing an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system by means of airlifters.
We offer this series in three variations.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
You can see the performance comparison there.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run entire plants with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable to connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model, but also offer a fan pump to accentuate the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (find in our shop) or with a decor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
I'm thinking a treasure chest, a shell or something.
The MK series has a special soundproof construction to ensure low noise levels.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to a drainpipe by a 4/6 mm air hose and can be started.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and mounted externally.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a back valve in between.
Just cut the air duct and put the valve in between.
This would prevent, once water runs backwards, the water from the basin running through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, as with other air pumps
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even though we're saying 3 days on ebay, we're packing every day and picking up every day.
If everything goes well on the road, it's very quick.
We are just trying to prevent it a little bit so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer once.
It would be like this, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping industry...of course, here no corona stops.
Please don't judge me badly just because the delivery is delayed, it's all the parcel service.
Of course, people like to scold these services, even if we say right now, they're having a hard time.
This also varies greatly by region.
Don't be mean to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you order the legs in bright colors?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and host into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported Saturday by the New Shepard missile system of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin company.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the western part of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally greeted the newly-commissioned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back", said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers stepped out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled for 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
Laura Shepard Churchley, 74, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and named Blue Origin's rocket system after her, and 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of honor at the company, which had paid for their tickets with four other passengers: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they each paid for their tickets, Blue Origin did not disclose.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard on his missions and do everything himself.
"It was just a flying saucer", the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to go back into space again, the presenter said.
The New Shepard can fly up to 60 miles
The New Shepard missile system is flying largely automated.
The capsule, which was detached from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 60 miles [100 km] above the earth, sometimes with zero gravity, before the reusable object was brought down again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aeronautical Union and many other experts view 100 kilometres above the earth as the boundary to outer space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin's third all-manned trip: the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second, in October, was attended by 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous for his role as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin vice president Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and I find the subject quite exciting in itself and I am also comfortable in the laboratory (I have already completed my inorganic chemistry internship).
I was also aware of my career prospects before I started studying, but I also thought about what I would like to study and do until I graduate.
I have my doubts, especially about my career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear about great job opportunities and the job is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low paid jobs.
So I 'd really like to know:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What did you study/what kind of training did you have?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you very much for your answers.
I'm really insecure right now and I'm thinking about maybe dropping out in 2022 and getting a degree in computer science.
If you have experience , she likes to write Mal too .
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up last week.
But I had to use my long weekend to relax.
So I'm just gonna post it now.
Not only before major holidays, such as Christmas, there is great stress in our company.
Looks like they're having it before the holidays plus bridge days.
Last week, Maria was taken to heaven, which we in Switzerland call the Ascension.
On Friday, most people and businesses have a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So, last week was a long four-day weekend.
So what happened last week?
Stress is everywhere.
A lot of e-mails that said they had to leave before they left, orders here, orders there, everything before the long weekend.
Because... yeah because?
Because "next week then" sounds like a long time and it can't be?
Or because people are seriously trying to do as much in a shortened week as they can in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, I was also very nervous.
What's with all the self-harm about the holidays?
What good are holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?
The stress was not from above, the colleagues were all in a very independent mood.
My question is simple: Are we the only ones like that, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her home country of Thuringia - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing is that even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian forest", the actress and singer told Hit Radio FFH.
She'll tune in to the party by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love that", said Catterfield.
But until the day she is sober, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any presents yet, so I have to go".
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the mice and the regeneration of the feathers.
NEKTON-bio contains all the essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage in poultry farming is due solely to nutritional deficiencies.
Since the feathers are made of protein, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet is essential for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large proportion of animal losses during the mice's lifetime are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient vitamin and mineral supply.
The composition of NEKTON-Bio explicitly takes into account and compensates for the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds.
No other vitamin should be administered while using NEKTON-bio.
NEKTON-bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you very much, I found it.
Still not working.
The E95 is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn (DRG) which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have made it operational
In 1924 the German Railways had commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive capable of carrying 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains on this line at a travel speed of 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided to supply the mechanical part as 1Co+Co1 locomotives with a bearing drive AEG, the electrical part being supplied by Siemens-Schuckertwerke.
From December 1927 to June 1928 six locomotives were delivered, with the serial numbers E 95 0106.
All survived World War II and found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
The repair works at Dessau confirmed that all six locomotives were fit for service.
[4] As the central German network became progressively re-electrified, and the need for locomotives for the heavy freight service increased, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were upgraded in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts suppliers.
The first to be built was the E 04, E 44 and E 94 available in larger quantities.
Only when it was obvious that the number of processing operations could not be increased further with the E 94 did the E 95 become the focus of the processing operation.
[4]The locomotives were initially stationed at the Leipzig-Waren railway works.
They came to the railway works hall P in 1960.
They were used in a separate route, mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal to Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complexity of the steering of the locomotives proved problematic with age.
It was common for snipers to stick to their guns during a gun battle.
Then the steward, who was always on the train, had to untie the gun with a hammer and chisel.
Damage to the drive engines was frequent and led to months of locomotive failure.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives in the late 1960s and no significant expansion of the electric operation was planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most of the scrap types, so the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition, they claimed that the German Railways wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one man, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's seat.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, the last to follow was the E 95 01, which was retired on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore never used.
All locomotives except E 95 02 have been dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heater at Halle Central Station.
It took some time before the Reichsbahn officials were convinced that the E 95 was fit for preservation as a museum locomotive.
In 1979 the first exterior work on the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show at RAW Dessau.
The locomotive was sold to the Dresden Transport Museum in the early 1990s.
The internal completion of the locomotive took place in 1986.
The locomotive is now on display at the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational upgrading of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintwork, with the transformers checked and five drive engines operational.
- The locomotives were used on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branching subsidiary lines until 1945, where they proved to be reliable drivers and low maintenance.
In February 1945 the machines were moved to Leipzig to the central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handmade model H0 in OVP, functioning well, there are optical repairs on the locomotive in self-work necessary, dusty, with game tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handmade model, very small edition- possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
Packaging may bear labels and storage marks.
Yeah, it's the F-parts.
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet..unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we gonna do now?
I can't make the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, which are unfortunately defective in their manufacture.
The centre bar does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I get new ones sent in.
When are they going to be sent?
No, not flat.
These are, according to the installation instructions, the right ones by shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose
They 're not flat with me
Could I have these sent over?
Hello #NAME#, do you want me to explain the problem again?
Fire in residential building with two lightly injured and heavy damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in an apartment building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated six-figure damage was caused, police said Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent apartment building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech county).
Two residents were reportedly taken to hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume that it was deliberate.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But she'll be here much later.
And I have to pay shipping again
To refute fake news, Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination on LinkedIn in early 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur posted a photo showing his corona vaccination.
A friend's illness prompted him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has posted a photo showing him getting a coronavirus vaccine.
There was a lot of misinformation on social media that I was not supposed to be vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine", Şahin wrote in a LinkedIn post on Friday.
"For several months now, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors".
So far, he's refused to do that because he doesn't want the communication to be about him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe COVID-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He didn't ask why.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, often fueled by misinformation and mistrust".
Fear is hard to combat with facts, and sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment", Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a priority in vaccinating the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the priority has long since been removed - and the biotech chief has, according to his own account, been vaccinated three times.
Fire at substation: Tens of thousands without power
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire at a substation caused severe damage, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia were without electricity for about 24 hours.
The fire knocked out lights for 41,000 affected residents in several communities on Friday evening.
The utility Westnetz reported that on Saturday, numerous emergency generators were in operation until the large-scale outage was finally completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and assistants from the THW provided assistance in the municipalities.
The authorities offered school care and called for neighborhood help.
The supplier thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We're well aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant limitations.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the county, the fire brigade and the fire service for their tireless efforts", said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take several days, he said, as the Western network's installers were only able to restore some lines to service temporarily.
The company claims that a technical defect led to the fire.
The power 's back on .
The fire, which broke out on Friday at about 7:15 p.m., has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken to implement the new rules.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
This bypass will restore the power.
Since 6pm on Saturday, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power restored.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 21.30 hours.
Since 11:15 p.m., the last affected people have had power.
Over 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were on duty.
Authorities had called for neighbourhood help on Saturday afternoon after emergency power was restored to important buildings.
"It is important now that citizens take care of the elderly or lonely in their neighbourhood and inform the local fire brigade if help is needed", said Sebastian Schuster (CDU), a member of the local council, after a crisis meeting.
The main focus of the installation and operation of emergency power generators was on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those who are unable to care for themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
- Good afternoon.
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy these from you and pay in euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG# day blanket in blue green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
I can't mount this on the tabletop.
It's a custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of this.
We wanted the ones with the tabletop diameters of #NUMBER#
We got a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push it in and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I'd have to send it back, since it's not fit for purpose.
I'd appreciate a little feedback.
Yeah, that's really easier!
Here's what we're gonna do.
Can you e-mail me the return receipt?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
Before I bought it, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Do you want me to do it now?
I find such low credit almost outrageous.
We disagree with that.
Nordic combination: the combiner wins
The German Nordic combines Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to give up once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a big lead after ski jumping into the track.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yeah, we both rebuilt it and we're using version 4.5...
You may have heard of a problem before.
I bought a book with my #PRS_ORG# directly, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I try to open it, the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be faulty. Contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone. Now what?
I have to work in between.
To make the paint job even and clean, clean the components with some soapy water from dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse and dry with clear water.
Before you apply a new paint to the model for the first time, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do that on the later-disappearing inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly, line by line.
A slight overlap of the paint layers will later provide a uniform surface.
Avoid swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates surfaces that seem unrealistic.
A model is not a fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones might shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come to a close with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metallic fibers can be produced when mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before installing them.
The decals or drawings give the models a true original look.
From aircraft badges to ship names to trim stripes and license plates on car models, decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still within easy reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be clamped or more easily clamped before being fitted to the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools, such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks, are time, patience, and a calm hand.
Cut out each decal you need and arrange it for you.
Decals are also called water slides because you moisten the back of them briefly with water until the supporting paper turns dark from the moisture.
Then, just push the picture a small piece of paper and place the piece on the appropriate spot on the model (which you also moistened beforehand).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the supporting paper to the side.
Caution: Always check that the picture fits properly before you push it off the paper completely, so that it does not stick to your finger, crease, or even tear.
Withdraw excess water with a household cloth.
Not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book briefly, and as soon as I look for something else, I stop reading the book and I have to log out and log in and reload the book and look for the place where I read.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
All three packages?
Because the lamp came in three separate packages to me.
Okay, thanks anyway.
I'll buy from somewhere else as soon as the money comes back.
But will I get it back without any problems?
Childcare in the event of a car accident / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello to all,
We've been in child-wishing treatment for a while, and now when it comes to the billing of the car, it suddenly comes up.
In order:
We had applied for the child-rearing program in advance to the car company and were approved after three attempts.
The trials were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and made two (unsuccessful) attempts, but they still did not account for the car.
We again applied for the cost to the car company and were again granted three more trials.
After a few more trials (we did more trials than promised, logically the most expensive ones are charged to the car) we submitted the invoices to the car and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the car wants to refund only 3 trials.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment are cancelled.
The second wish for a child is a new insurance case.
The AGB states that "the insurance case begins with the cure and ends when the need for treatment ceases".
The questions for the experts in this round:
* Who is right here, the car (only 3 tries are reimbursed) or us (it is 5 tries to be reimbursed)?
* Should the car insurance companies have been obliged to warn us in the promises that further attempts would be cancelled with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The first child does not cure infertility (due to a blocked fallopian tube).
It would be great if the experts here could give you their opinion.
Thank you for your help.
Can you please email me the three options and tell me the best way to get back to them?
I'll be right there.
We're not ordering anything else from them.
If you add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME#, you've obviously lost a good customer.
You can pass that on to your manager.
It's not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund was arranged and now you're telling me that I have to return the thing first.
I guess it's not my fault the dresser arrives at my door completely disturbed.
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the refund has been arranged and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager you've lost two regulars.
My friend also ordered various pieces of furniture for our apartment from his account.
We're not doing that anymore.
No, the defect didn't appear until a few months later.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
The guarantee is valid for 24 months.
No, I can't get another kind of wrapping.
I'll be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your #PRS_ORG series
These products are advertised with stools to be purchased as an additional item, but unfortunately we cannot find them at your place.
Can you help?
This week's topic: The best low budget movies
There is no general definition of what a low-budget film is with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say:
A low-budget film is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
There are plenty of low-budget listings on the Internet, such as Letterboxd.com.
Do you know of any interesting representatives of this category?
What's so exciting about it?
And what might you not like?
I'm a very good customer of yours, I've already furnished two apartments with your furniture.
I was just asking for the best price on Odelle's gray leather sofa.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is it reliable now?
Thank you very much .
With warm greetings
If you don't have a phone number, a chat room where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat room!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.

'Half-Win' against Belarus at high cost to the EU
The EU can declare a "half-victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs are very high and have meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, said the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This impasse - Belarus is not giving up very much, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
The treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
There appears to be a "growing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
The EU as a whole is not taking a firm stand against this, and this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakened cohesion in the Union.
'It cannot be enforced if a Member State sets its head to do its thing', as in Poland, which does not even allow the EU border agency Frontex access to the border.
The EU is also paying a price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said, saying that it would be difficult to agree on a policy on asylum in principle because the line of "border, border, border protection" has been strengthened.
Re-attempted crossing of border
According to Polish border guards, migrants have once again tried to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were detained on Sunday night and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were said to have been stoned by the migrants in the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, border guards recorded 52 attempts to cross the border within 24 hours.
By Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had broken through the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the Belarus-EU border in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of joining the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have sealed off border sections.
The EU has imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
EU Commissioners also travelled to countries of origin to prevent people from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response was to put pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has put its market power on the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions".
The European Union is also committed to the implementation of the Paris Agreement.
The Belarusian society is not likely to allow the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula One final
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two violations of the rules during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - Mercedes has filed an appeal after the controversial Formula One final in Abu Dhabi.
The silver arrows suggest two breaches of the rules in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged infraction by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the final safety car phase when he allegedly overtook illegally.
A second objection was lodged against the score at the end of the race.
Mercedes believes that the protocol was not followed.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and was on his way to his first Formula One title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars ahead of him.
I'll check on that.
I 'll talk to the bank and get back to you .
Thank you for your support.
Free entry for members: Europa-Park is hosting SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, which gives its name to the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited Fantag to SC Freiburg.
According to the park, members and permanent ticket holders of the Breisgau sports club and members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park free of charge on that day.
In addition, there were coupons for drinks and sausage.
The roller coasters were shining through the red and white jerseys that day.
Foxes, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop", says the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesligisten and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has been in place since the early 1990s.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park once again showed how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster is proof of that", says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it the number and not the original 1699?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home"
In the context of the literary series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read her latest novel "Home" in the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as a moderator.
She's divorced, lives in a house on the coast, and listens attentively to the nightly noises at her door.
I filled out the contact form yesterday to return an item, but I didn't get an email confirmation or anything like that.
My question would be whether my request was received.
Not everyone has time for your crazy chatter and fake cheap Chinese goods.
Your mistake, which you will correct, and not all of our household.
Please contact Mrs #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had been chatting yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a re-order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This e-mail hasn't come yet.
I want to take the package to #PRS_ORG today.

It's like when a foreigner says he has nothing against foreigners.

Yeah, wow, you're not as serious as my colleague.
Anyone who seriously questions the basic premise of evolution is simply completely lost.

And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like colleague
To obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be placed as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass almost without any label or colour error up to the edge.
Often magnifying glasses are marked with magnification markings.
However, these particulars are only applicable to precisely defined conditions which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To make the best use of your magnifying glass, please follow the instructions in the table 'Technical specifications' (see package leaflet).
Light reflections are produced on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including in the case of impact lenses.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
If the optimum conditions of use are observed - the magnifying glass is close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
For further information, see the package leaflet (available in English and German).
The following are the main features of the new system:
Whether as a reading aid for travel or simply for everyday trifles, the Zeiss VisuCard is the ideal helper, as it can be carried anywhere thanks to its handy format.
And their hardness makes them resistant to the rigors of the old days.
Each magnifying glass includes a check card case for storage and safe transportation.
You bid on these parts, which you see in the pictures or described under "What you bid on".

Furniture sale in Schönwolde: Women in the municipality of Krembz are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has had some strange experiences with the fir sale.
One man reportedly drove home without his partner because they could not agree.
He plants 2,000 a year.
The 56-year-old has experienced many strange situations.
He says that's what makes Christmastime fun.
What about the coupon?
Otherwise I'm out as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective shipment and now I'm paying full price for it.
Then I'll judge that accordingly!
We do not need to debate the better course here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat grilled on a spinning spit.
And both have their names from that.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Treher", which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
I'm having trouble with the fiber optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I'm having trouble getting a stable Wi-Fi network up and running.
I had a 50 Mb DSL before and I used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mb without fail, except for a few failures.
The new fibre optic connector sends 500 Mbits to the FritzBox 7590 and these are also received by the DLan module connected to the FritzBox.
However, the other DLan module, which transmits the Wifi, does not receive the full 500, but the farther I am in the house with the module, the less it receives (so use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the internet on the first floor is now even slower than before (~45 Mbits) with the new fibre connection.
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but the losses were similar.
Can someone explain to me why fiber optics is losing so much Internet speed over the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
I would therefore be all the more pleased to have an answer.
When it's time to change your checking account
Whoever thought that the current account would be quiet now is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to use all sorts of tricks to get their customers to confirm past fee increases, the discount rates for negative interest rates are also falling further.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered to be relatively generous with a limit of EUR 100,000.
Now she's cut the bonus in half and even cut the daily allowance in half.
In a first step, the limit was reduced to EUR 50,000 for current and investment accounts and EUR 25 000 for overnight deposits for customers of the Postbank Group.
The Commission has already taken a decision on the application of the exemption for the use of the euro.
This is not only for new contracts but also for 'newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers'.
Commerzbank had previously been reduced to a limit of EUR 50 000, which still applies, as was the case for ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the exemption in two stages, first to EUR 50,000 and now to EUR 25,000.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a discount of 25,000 euros or less, according to data from the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin also reached EUR 25.000, but there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have even won a case against this scheme in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin.
The banks are already discussing whether they should make provisions in case the higher authorities declare negative interest rates inadmissible in principle and many millions of banking customers have to be repaid.

Jennifer Aniston has a whole army of beauty professionals.
She's officially the leader of Hollywood now.
But their life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the American magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For the actress, who made a splash in 2021 with her Friends reunion and the continuation of her series The Morning Show, this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
Her appearance is the work of an army of assistants, stylists and trainers.
After all, Aniston says, she treats herself to one chip a day (yes, correctly read: one chip from the bag).
That she still has the hearts of both male and female fans is actually a miracle.
Maybe it's just that she's having bad luck and still looking for the big love.
And crossed out the baby wishes.
Before, she was constantly asked when she was going to be a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked me that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope success and fame make you happy.
Undignified end to career: Raikkonen must resign
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat off his forehead.
That's it, man.
After a driving error and a slight tyre contact, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife Minttu and two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Reichkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He won 21 Grands Prix, started 18 times from pole position and finished 103 times on the podium.
Friedrich wins the 60th World Cup - Nolte wins the two-bob - Sport
The goal of the bobsledder is to achieve the record of 94 wins set by Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen.
"I've calculated that I would have to win nine and a half races a season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026", said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two wins in two days at the Winterberg races.
He only defended the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths on Saturday, when he went from third to first place.
Then he changed the material setting a little bit and drove a bigger 0.30 second lead on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed against the British Brad Hall.
Third was Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded", said Friedrich, who also won his 22nd victory in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who plays for Stuttgart, came in fifth place after finishing second.
Christoph Hafer of BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it like that", Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
In the women's category, Laura Nolte took home her third win of the season in the double bob.
After only finishing fourth in the monobobob the day before, she raced to the World Cup with Deborah Levi in the German triple jump on Sunday.
Two-bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She also won the first podium this winter in addition to her Olympic qualification.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was super cool, first podium at the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me.
I'm super excited about the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay", said Burghardt, stressing: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not-quite-flawless drives, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore can't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
I had a whole different set of problems last year because of Corona and never had time for it.
And now they're saying it's expired, which makes me very angry.
Check the chat room. It was about the Asare bench.
I'd like to return it and order it again, since it's on sale now.
Why isn't the shipment starting until March 16th?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time.
No, not until I tap it, and it'll come up with an extra box with the message.
Picked up by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong shipment.
But we still want the shelf module, a new, intact one.
And not cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello, my lovely girls and girls and women,
I have a few things I want to write, and maybe one or the other of you will be...
I'm 24, I have CTE, I'm a full-time student, and I'm a dog mom -- except my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's actually one-to-one with my child.
My friend (she's been together for 6 years) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday, and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
I went to see him yesterday because I have emotional needs and I want to see and feel him, and we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is bandaged from the burn).
He's also cold and we're seeing less of each other at the moment, which is making it very difficult for me to cope with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy just had a stomachache, and I cooked for him, and now he's in his blanket, and he's relaxed a little bit after I've been there with the heat lamp and caressing him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just been away for a month.
Now we're gonna have to do some housework, which we're gonna split up.
But cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD is fine now, I'm halfway through the treatment and I'm doing fine.
Not well, but I'm doing fine and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot of things, I have a written test tomorrow at 3pm that I haven't done anything for, and anatomy class the day after tomorrow that I should at least prepare for.
And next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is on my calendar and not in my head because there's no room left.
So my week is gonna be like this: just until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But after that, it's all gonna go on, right?
Just until my birthday.
Just until the holidays start.
Just until the weekend.
Just until...
And it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental cues, because otherwise I'm gonna get this down.
I feel guilty and chaotic, but I can't do it any other way.
Is that how you guys are?
Honestly, I'm so grateful I don't have to work.
I'm so grateful, I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my KPTBS otherwise.
I think it has something to do with the mental load of women, so I thought I'd find some female companions here.
I wish you a restful evening, the week is almost over.
I got my order today. Unfortunately, it's all different color, plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has a print.
When we first shipped it, the color was exactly the same as the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch tables now, I get a different color, right?
The cancellation email was sent on the 26th of December.
Two times, by the way.
But it was not confirmed.
I found that many religious teachers did not believe in God and that religion was just another subject for them, like math or geography.
For me, it was always a little strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I kind of always believed that.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also tell of workmates and fellow students who have different attitudes.
I understand the difference between private and professional life, and it makes sense to separate.
There's a curriculum and so on.
But I'd just find it odd to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
You mean like culture or something?
I hope this isn't too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Write in English, I understand that too.
It's been a long time, I wouldn't do it.
I'm good, thank you.
I expect a reply soon, at the latest early next week.
Thank you for your support.
Please help me find a movie
Hello, people.
I 'm looking for a movie from my childhood .
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
The film has two time axes (or parallel worlds).
One is modernity (the real world).
The other is the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in detail, in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier.
For some reason, the paths cross and a plot is born.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into that realm so she can live on her own, I think.
The crossing is also the soldier's grave, I believe.
In the end, both soldiers fight each other, I think.
If that means anything to you, I'm grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach since week one.
Fast forward to live:
Just relax.
A child like that can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything's in place, no cuddling, more going in and looking, but no minutes of surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
It's a good mattress.
No pillows.
Ahso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but we always had a blanket.
Watch your child sleep.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it get up from the belly?
Or is it face-first, right in the mattress?
That's how you can tell if everything's okay.
We all grew up, and when my husband was born, it was like, "Oh, you put the kids on their stomachs to sleep".
Besides, we're already regular customers and have bought a lot of items.
But then why are you only offering me 20 euros?
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a reply.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
I'm asking you to contact me as soon as possible.
The closet is not in use at the moment.
Let me be clear.
RBTV was promising.
And yes, I know, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this station are so fucked up.
Almost every format is sponsored, but then at the same time, you go on a big begging tour.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
To quote Arno: "You don't want to be a running litface".
What are you now?
An 0815 commercial trying to get his BilloMerch to the elite fan base.
And then we have Marah's do's and don'ts.
Which, of course, applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogman who has no empathy and is trying to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How can you say that's good?
I'd love it if you liked it, but I think it's terrible.
I'm sorry, my wooden table was delivered defective.

Cherry seed pillows are a traditional home remedy for beneficial heat applications, as cherry seeds absorb heat very well and can be dosed back.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft grip makes it especially comfortable to use, so that the little ones feel safe even when they are not doing so well.
The cherry seed cushion with reference is suitable as a heat source only for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for any unusual odor, stick or burn marks and dispose of them immediately if found.
Please remove the inner cushion for warming up from the frame first.
Heat in the microwave at maximum 300 watts for maximum 2 minutes (note the microwave manufacturer's instructions!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back in the seat.
The first heating may produce a slight moisture buildup on the surface, which disappears with repeated application.
Be sure to follow the warming instructions, as prolonged periods or higher energy levels can cause damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that the manufacturer's instructions allow heating of grain products.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the seat, please check the temperature of the cushion for baby fit (max. 43 °C) at your armrest.
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile conditions, circulatory problems, fresh haematomas, bruising and open wounds, and in people with reduced pain.
If you have any pre-existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour problems and you are pregnant, please consult a doctor before using this medicine.
If seams are opened and loose grains are released, discard the product and the loose grains immediately and away from children.
If the product is used in infants under 1 year of age, the child' s temperature should be monitored regularly during use to avoid overheating.
Any serious incident occurring in connection with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The bracket shall be removable and machine washable at 30 °C.

Is the battery dead?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) stopped charging through my power supply.
I bought this new about five months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to keep it running.
It's a malfunction. The battery's dead and the laptop won't start, even though it's plugged in.
I've disconnected the battery, but nothing happens here.
You guys got any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on the network?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help.
I want the delivery of #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is.
You're on tour a lot and still carry a lot of equipment?
The Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design is no problem.
The 20 litre capacity of the camera can easily accommodate larger equipment that can be securely stowed with the help of the padded FlexFold splitters.
And what you need for everyday objects, thanks to convenient access, stays well organized and separate from the camera equipment in the individually configurable interior.
With the Update of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is also presented in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design is literally the epitome of the Everyday Backpack series, which Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the backpack's interior while still providing instant access to photographic equipment.
This works in two ways: one is conventionally through the lid valve, which can be locked with the MagLatch latch system, a brilliantly designed solution for effective protection that has already been proven in the messenger bags.
The locking valve is fitted with a metal hook with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has different fullness levels: there are four anchor beams, firmly placed, into which the lock hook can be hooked.
When the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it's more empty, a deeper one.
The flapper and hook are also magnetic.
This also allows the backpack to be securely closed without the hook being broken.
The second option is also a fundamental difference between the Everyday Backpack and other photo backpacks: in addition to the lid, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top-down access - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly enhances the everyday usability of the backpack, since you carry not only your camera equipment but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and easily store both separately from each other - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of your body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items stay safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable seat belts are a help.
And because the outer cover of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents stay dry even when it is to be shipped to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I'm waiting in vain for your support email.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me
If you extend the coupon, I'll be able to place a larger order in a moment, but I kept the damaged piece of furniture and didn't return it.
And I didn't know that last year was going the other way I thought it would be, and I just couldn't make it up to you in time.
But I'm the one who's gonna get hurt as a customer, and I'm not gonna take it.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks of water at the south fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly, triggering the so-called California Gold Rush of 49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and most prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were paved, tents set up, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was Coloma or Bust!
In this game, you are a pioneer who is seeking wealth in the West and making a name for himself.
You'll be prospecting for gold, recruiting workers, collecting horses and building businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river channels and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your fellow pioneers to avoid going broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, you must manage your resources and build a table that works more and more for you  (so-called Engine Building).
The buildings on your board allow you to become more efficient, get extra action or change rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your own individual playing style through subtle adjustments.
Coloma is set over a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is uncovered and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will be banned!
This deactivates the other half of the site - reducing the number of actions that can be done there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving chariots, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gun heroes.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The player who wins the game turns to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the announcer has moved five times, so covered each location once, and the year is over.
There is a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gun heroes and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants"
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation showed up on my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest on talk shows and lectures throughout Europe.
His book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) sparked a heated debate in parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I'm very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
We parents and other responsible persons must never, never, never, ever, try to control the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child room to develop and to make the framework as large for the child as is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries discussing elimination of test requirement for triple vaccinated
The health ministers of the Länder want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the test requirement for triple vaccinated at their next meeting.
"We need to quickly clarify whether and when the test requirement for three-time vaccinated people can be waived", Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, told Bild am Sonntag.
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people "not only makes medical sense but also provides an additional incentive to vaccinate", Holetschek said.
The German Federal Minister for Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised 'that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on Tuesday.'
So I'm gonna send the lamp back.
What's the best way to do that?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't shop through my #PRS_ORG anymore.
Oops, there's been a mistake.
Shopping is done through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I updated the account information.
What could be the reason?
What you describe is called "awareness", meaning sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1,000.
The most common is hearing sounds/voices, less often seeing images and the rarest being pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are surgeries that have a high level of awareness because they avoid very deep anesthesia to protect the child until the navel is removed.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia interview.
Certain anaesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but had none by definition.
I misread your comment.
The chair is broken.
I'm afraid the 20 euros won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is a legal requirement and standard in e-commerce.
Please check again if you're at least taking the defective chair back.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
We're losing a lot of money.
I already sent you an e-mail you didn't answer.
I'm gonna ask you again.
The order and the invoice say the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver at the front door because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that right?
If so, I'll have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture upstairs.
I'm not going to get a call?
I had asked a question.
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has made a name for himself as a theatre critic and as an intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's the new book on the table, fresh out of print: "An Old Man Getting Older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, the news comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is, "I'm grateful for my life".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is the Europalet, a standardised wooden pallet used mainly in Europe as a load carrier.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
In 2020, according to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was just over 79 million euros.
The number of pallets imported into Austria per year is not charged
New York is the first MLS champion
New York City FC has won the title of Major League Soccer for the first time.
After a 1-1 draw in the regular season against the Portland Timbers, the Eastern Conference team decided the final in the penalty shootout with a score of 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference finals, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Roladen tips and tricks
I had been here a week ago getting a lot of great tips on the perfect goulash.
We had this for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for that .
I'm just getting used to it and I want to make my first roll-your-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-own-o
Tomorrow I'm going to start a cattle fund for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have a stove, just a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back to my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't so good anymore, but I'll get it.
It is a question of a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed by e-mail on 18 January that the refund had been made.
But to this day, I have not received the money.
Would you check there, please?
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is part of the Christmas season, like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any chicken yet?
Time is running out.
We'll tell you where in the Lübeck area you can still get a Christmas roast.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the valve reactor circuit.
The VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls allow you to set the desired level and the noise level of your sounds.
The VT+ series also offers a unique power level controller that reduces the sound level without changing the gain or distortion.
I heard upstairs that the power level controller can even float a power reserve if it gets loud.
The power level controller enables the full potential of the VT+ series to be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal is processed by a box simulation, so that even when using headphones or recording live, you get an eminently 'acoustic' sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
If you also have a VFS5 foot keyboard, you can also comfortably call up the sounds by walking, turn the effects blocks on/off and tap the tempo of the correspondingly compatible effects.
This is actually essential for live operations.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I've seen it in others.
Is there any way you can send the lamp back?
Because it's too low to hang over a dining room table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
What about the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a discount or a coupon.
I might be able to find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a bit much.
I just got my shipment and I was wondering if any screws were included in the shipment.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the hook provided.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
The negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement are making progress, according to Iran.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda", Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told IRNA on Sunday.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement resumed after a break of almost a week.
The negotiations are being held with the participation of negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia.
The US delegation is also in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now the federal state with the highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in the whole of Germany.
The only state with a value above 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to have a corona incidence above 1,000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day reading of 1,025 new infections per 100,000 people.
In Saxony, which had recently been the country's highest incidence, the figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but was also above the 1000 mark.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional infection-related deaths were reported in one day.
200 people with severe COVID-19 were treated in hospitals on Sunday for intensive care.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely keeping up with new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will not take place until the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and deliver it to the post office, right?
I don't have to click/specify/fill anything else?
That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid, which is why I'm writing to you.
I'd like to take care of the return at my own expense.
I think that 8 euros in return is a bit of a stretch.
It 's time for a change .
###MBundestag welcome, I'm at the plenary in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why is the mail here?
If you look at the activity in the last few months of the Bundestag, one thing is clear: it is not there.
We've come into a winter rigidity and extended the summer hole to a few months.
# What's the problem?
Yeah, what was it?
I think that this is largely due to the dissatisfaction with how some things have gone and how we are in general.
In the last few days, the impression has become more and more apparent that many here really still have a taste for the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
The Community is asked at this point about the Bundestag, which one wants to keep it alive.
The initiative came from u/edizVEVO, which has been aware of this project in recent days and has found a pile of debris, to put it simply.
After some correspondence, several people from the community have come forward who are eager to rebuild the project.
I would like to ask the Commissioner to give us a few examples of the way in which he has been able to do this.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange information and work out concrete things.
You can access the server via this link.
Objectives: to promote the
* How will the Bundestag work in the future?
* What existing orders need to be changed/adapted/removed?
* How should we behave in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot a few things, which isn't bad, because we end up with Discord.
If you have the time and the desire, come to Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide our future.
I ordered a lampshade from you, and it's still on the way.
Now I see that the item is too big/clunky for that and not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered another pendant for that.
I put it together and I noticed this when I took the soft foam.
I'm very sorry about that.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in oversized, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up soon.
And I'm asking you to arrange that now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can call me anytime to schedule a pickup.
Is there a manual for the installation?
How long will I have to get them or decide on returning them?
How would you answer the question, "Why are you vegan?"
I had a conversation today with a colleague I like.
She herself was once a vegetarian, and she rarely eats meat now.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before that.
When asked if I had always wanted to be a vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned interim step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that was that for a long time, I thought that being a vegetarian would support animal welfare, but then I thought about it and realized that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to become a vegan.
And at that moment, I got the impression that there was resentment on her part, and she was defending vegetarianism, and she said she knew where her meat came from and that being a vegetarian would reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "clumsy"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like being a vegan is a very quick way to get cornered and get into conflicts that you wouldn't have otherwise.
It is a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception under Section 312d of the BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not at the appointed date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
I can't be there for a funeral, so I'm afraid that can't be changed.
Can I have an alternate pick-up date, please?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I'm constantly on the lookout.
Lahnsteiner defences equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euro grant from the country
The Minister of the Interior of Rhineland-Palatinate Roger Lewentz recently presented Mayor Peter Labonte with a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment of the Volunteer Fire Brigade of Lahnstein at Lahnstein City Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this", says Peter Labonte, the mayor of Lahnstein.
The equipment car is used by the diving squadron Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They perform tasks above and below water in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
The growth of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle and the continuing increase in the use of the Lahn as a recreational stream contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed her recommendations, but I synced, removed, and reloaded the app, and it didn't work.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole thing has taken me a long time and I'm hoping for help now.
Okay, here's the deal.
I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter an appointment in the ordering process?

Thank you for taking this whole thing on, I also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar capacity, we were also arms carriers in the executive, I don't want to go into that!
I always find the question of right and left very simplistic.
But basically, you should say that of course the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That of course even in special uniforms and weapons people are attracted to the right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can then of course have a hard time dealing with the lived reality is of course also clear, because you have of course in addition to the average white, meanwhile many Germans with a migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I do not mean now the exaggerated feminine clichés, because these are in the executive rather less or not at all but quite normal men and women who do not notice if they do not tell you) and also on these people can and I have to rely, because in doubt they will save you your life or this one for you.
But even these marginalized groups, even if it sounds strange in my experience, are proud of Germany and feel less isolated by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if they are supposedly defending or trying to do their fair, and they simply want to be treated as normal people.
Back to the right, since of course the police and the armed forces are also a cross section of society, you will also find extreme right there, but that they can openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been in foreign missions often start to make a blanket statement because of negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It is also possible that right-wing people who share the same views meet and exchange ideas.
I think that this is a good thing to do, and I think that political education and education are also a good way of countering this.
Germany is so internationally involved and that is so good that in my opinion we could not afford to have any real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yeah, I don't understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered it in November.
But I was told in your order confirmation
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I was chatting with #NAME# earlier.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or is this basket available anywhere in Germany.
You're the only company I've ever found to be a partner.
But on the top of the edge of the wood there are two deep notches that have been filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself, there's a little scratch.
More orderly with a child?
Hello, I've been wondering about something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little free time), but in my life I have been able to keep my household clean and tidy.
There's always phases where everything just sits there, and then every now and then it grabs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it's never really like that. Someone could come to visit spontaneously.
My husband is not better either, it bothers me somewhat but most of the time he loses his household to work and displeasure.
The kitchen is still the most regularly cleaned since we like to cook.
Now, to my question, have you managed to get any more tidy with a child?
We have no but working on it and this question has been bothering me for some time.
Because I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me as long as there are no visitors and, for example, there are always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Is there a greater incentive to have a child or to remain sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality, anatomically preformed, offering maximum comfort, perfect fit, and allowing almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preformed with special, further imprinting on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the Flex System 2 has more than doubled the area covered by the Flex System to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels on the joints reduce friction (arms, arms and knees)
High-quality preforms in the lower back and step make for a perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the lumbar spine area increases the flexibility around the back fastener and thereby improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and installing the equipment on the surface.
The free flex zone around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a heating, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
It's positioned on the chest, it brings heat to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) face seal on the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate hood)

The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wristband computers)
A career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have been trained in software development and have been self-taught for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I'm increasingly realizing that this job is not for me, so I've been thinking about starting over and studying social work for a while.
The problem is that I have an anxiety-avoidant personality disorder (AED).
That means I have no self-esteem and am shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a matter-of-fact level, but I have a hard time having casual conversations and I've been told many times that I seem unapproachable (which I think has improved).
Can I be a social worker like that?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, say, addiction counseling or family support.
I do not know if the actual workplace is really what I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The EASP is already causing problems in my job (emotionally for me) because it puts me down whenever there is something to complain about in my code ("it screws up the simplest things again") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I keep him away from work with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I am under-resourced" etc.).
I'm probably going to have problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it right away.
But you got the couch back already?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I'm waiting for a pick-up.
What do you mean , " give back " ?
When I download a book on #PRS_ORG#, the message comes your #PRS_ORG# does not authorise this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, and he asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my locker.
The protein the bird takes in along with the food is broken down into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract, which in turn builds up its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in the nesting and re-formation of feathers in the moulting birds are extremely complex processes and involve a particularly high level of stress on the animal's entire organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this may cause disturbances in the brood cycle.
Following this treatment with NEKTON-bio, the daily vitamin supply should be reverted to NEKTON-S (multivitamin) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).

1 g of NEKTON organic per 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/feed as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/feed daily.
One coated measuring spoon (in-line) is equivalent to 1 g of NEKTON bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, the dose of NEKTON-Bio may be initially doubled or tripled until the onset of feather regeneration is apparent.
After this, the normal dose is administered until the feather regeneration is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15°C and 25°C.
Excuse me, but this chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after nine months ?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you get this e-mail?
Statement by a municipal employee in opposition to the statutes
Hello, German legal counsel,
I have this problem.
We're having a walnut tree cut down on our property.
So, filed a complaint with the city.
A colleague writes to me that cutting down fruit trees and with them the walnut is not part of the charter.
The statutes, however, explicitly state that the walnut is a tree to be protected.
Can I trust the employee's statement now or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we'll use the new packaging for it.
I haven't heard from him.
Well, then I still have an unused sofa.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think so, but the question is, can I pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany?
Can you check that?
Emergency report: serious road accident at Selb
A serious accident has recently occurred on the St 2179 between the junction of Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
According to the press release from the police at the moment (14:03 am), a car has come into the opposite traffic while overtaking.
There are wounded.
Ah, all right, I see.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy.
Advice and ideas for continuing working life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good because my dear head is just sorting out everything that can be sorted out.
Before I get to the bottom of this, I need advice, and I need advice from people who know my situation, and that's you.
I'm doing the ref as a cross-country runner.
I originally studied something else and worked in a field there (to remain anonymous, I won't say anything more specific).
But then I got bored and I started looking for alternatives that would make it more fun.
And eventually I ended up in the teaching profession, and I was sure it was -- even though the framework is much more inflexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I've just come to the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been six months.
In the previous paintings, I always decided to go ahead and at least finish the ref, and then I could still turn around.
But right now I'm totally done.
I've had so little free time this past month, I'm completely exhausted.
It's vacation time, but I still have a lot of work to do.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my weekend was my weekend.
I had the day off.
And the stress of work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family reunion is too much stress for me.
And then there's these rigid structures that annoy me extra.
It's fun, basically, and from the outside, the ref is doing well, in terms of feedback and stuff.
But I'm completely exhausted, and I wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shut down -- if it's not already.
I'm wondering if this is how I want to spend the rest of my working life -- especially as I'm reading some of your posts here -- or if I should go back to the old way where I was valued, where I could take time off when I needed it, and I found the work kind of boring, but I was paid adequately for it, and I worked together as a team, and not as a lone fighter like I do most of the time.
But then I wonder if I'll be back in the same place in a year and not be satisfied.
You know, it's all kind of confusing, but maybe you have some outside advice or ideas on how to get me out of this situation where I'm completely overwhelmed and I'm almost crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not gonna make decisions that emotional right now, which probably doesn't lead to anything good.
But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for now.
Thank you for reading and I apologize for my crying tone.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its launch in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been continuously evolving, resulting, among other things, in the combination of advanced modelling technology with the Valve Reactor circuit, which perfectly simulates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we're introducing a brand new modeling engine that's absolutely state of the art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers provide an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also contain, of course, the multi-stage Valvetronix pre-tube amplifier.
This is based in part on real analog circuits, because they simply get the variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, VTX amplifiers offer a closed case and a bass reflex system that allows natural resonances to bubble out.
With VOX's Tone Room software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on a virtual level until the amplifier and effects sound exactly as you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modelling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a further performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed to suit all guitarists looking for maximum variety of sound.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string beats, and a prompt speech.
During a detailed analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sonic character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic are losing to the Clippers.
The Orlando Magic NBA losing streak is still going strong.
The Wagner brothers can shine, but they can't beat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers 104-106 on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also customizable: with three individually playable and foldable clasp parts, it is fully adapted to the needs of your camera equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras, from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible kit would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two or three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
And there's a lot of stuff to put away.
And if you have a small DSLM camera, you can use the backpack for your equipment and for nonphotographic items.
Even drone pilots find the Everyday Backpack 20L an optimal choice, as the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the eruption, lava flows have caused great damage on the Canary Islands.
Is there an end in sight?
The eruption on La Palma, which has lasted 85 days, is the longest in the known history of the Canary Islands.
The eruption of Tehuya in 1585 was the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, lasting 84 days.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
Although the activity of the as-yet-unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, volcanologists still dare not predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable", said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to state television station RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the lava, which is over 1,000 degrees Celsius, has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other structures, RTVE reported.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That's almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landforms, with a combined size of about 50 hectares, were formed off the coast by cooled lava.
The most serious damage was to the island's banana crop, which is vital to the island's 85,000 inhabitants and which directly or indirectly supports about half of their livelihood.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely damaged, reported El País.
Christmas and Gifts
Christmas is coming, and especially the children will be looking forward to the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive about them, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling excitement.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of natural peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be brought back to life in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas Became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who made Christmas days closely associated with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were given in one way or another on St. Nicholas' Day.
The background to this tradition, which is still popular today, is that St. Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women one night to spare them another life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving gave rise to the popular German custom of filling the boots of children with gifts.
Protestants were opposed to this practice because they rejected intermediaries between God and man as "saint worship".
For these reasons they are resistant to the institution.
Martin Luther made the baby Nicholas the Christ, thus establishing a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
But since most Protestants no longer view such details with such a narrow mind, few are offended that the custom of St. Nicholas, like the Martins' Day custom of singing and changing the Martins, is still a regular part of the Christmas season.
Today, in boots on the doorstep and under the Christmas tree, you can find everything your heart desires, from socks to luxury watches.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources attest to a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas' Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian lands, however, there is a happy quarrel over who is bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christchild appears on Easter or the Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
These include his white drunkard's beard, which bears little resemblance to the more severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his reindeer-drawn sleigh, and his preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy the witch Befana is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fairy tales sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, it brought Santa some fame.
Here, it's not reindeer, but three horses pulling the sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing out gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
A gunman was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man allegedly carrying a gun into a bank and a bookmaker's shop.
The man fled in a vehicle, authorities said, but was stopped by officers a short time later.
Shots were fired and the man was shot.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police didn't assume a terrorist background.
There are several embassies in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
What kind of a thing?

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is easy to set up and can be anchored to the ground with 2 earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lighting time up to 10 hours
- The rugged plastic construction is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it's usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow colorfully inside.
On the other hand, Smart Stone is quite harmless: the sun alone makes this solar light shine in a fascinating way  in either white or colored light (in six different shades).
The design, which is edgeless and amorphous, is deliberately chosen: like a natural large pebble, this modern light object presents itself in daylight.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment  whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and findlings, where it can assert itself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of work: as a solar lamp, Smart Stone does not require a conduit or batteries.
Place the light stone in any place that is sunny during the day.
Two earth spikes are provided to provide a firm hold if necessary.
The matte-white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides Smart Stone discreetly inside, along with its battery and two LEDs  one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery charges when the sunlight hits the housing.
At dusk, Smart Stone will begin to glow automatically; in which color, you decide: You have six attractive light colors to choose  besides daylight white .
The battery is automatically switched off when the battery charge level has fallen to a minimum or when it is bright again.
Once the sun shines again, the next day's charging cycle starts over.
I've tried that a few times. It doesn't work.
I'm sorry, I would have liked to order more from you, but if I don't get the coupon, I won't order again.

Pill Problems
Hello, my dear ladies,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
My problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and fucking PMS before my period.
Now I'd like to keep that, because I have enough medication to take because of chronic diseases that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had this last two-year break from zero to 100 and I had these explosive pimples all over me.
So far so good, but I was pretty stressed and I didn't feel right.
In the two years of break, it never really got back to normal.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid that this time.
I'm already wearing no perfume and no makeup, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend.
I'm afraid the gynecologist didn't take me seriously and the dermatologist's appointment is still up.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel.
Yeah, the pretty skin is such a thing.
Had a bad case of prepuce neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then extensive bone marrow and acne issues.
I tried everything I could during my illness and I stuck to sugar, milk and lean meat mixed with food because nothing else worked so well.
It may be that hormonal is just the worm, but when you have a construction site like me, you don't want to go looking for anything else that's wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague Semina o. ä.
I wrote and now I've lost the conversation and I don't know what was answered to my request.
I'm always working and on the phone and then suddenly everything was gone...
What's there to check? If the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank records, maybe there was something wrong.
But is it generally available in large
It 's available in black .

In the name of the people, laypeople, let's make judgments
In the courtroom, they're sitting on the bench in their everyday clothes.
But even if they do not wear a robe, much depends on their judgment: The judges decide with professional judges whether and for how long someone is behind bars.
Two of them report in conversation with the "Offensive" from their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht at John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.
Hello, I'm sorry, I can't get into the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice from order number #NUMBER# again to the above e-mail address?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no way of keeping this for that long.
We would use the table as they offer it as if it were our own
I would have liked to have ordered the same seat in blue in November and got it.
Does the cabinet need to be completely dismantled for collection and return?
And when was the pickup?
110 kV earth cable to be built in 2022
The authorization for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is final.
The planning approval decision of the Lower Bavarian government clears the way for construction to start in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now announced this.
The earth cable, which is about seven kilometres long, will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality with the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pärrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a free-wire mast near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning, my dear.
My order from 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts.
The blue number of the BETZELL:#PRS_ORG# with the serial number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a nice start to the week.
You can forget that, I explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the whole sides are cracked, so there's glass everywhere and the carton is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come in the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
That means the dresser can't be picked up because no one's allowed in my apartment.
Thanks for the message.
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's in all the books, which is why the #PRS_ORG request is, because it's probably a general problem.
Ref: Teaching plan (EC)
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his report.
I've been in the Ref since the summer, I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently having great trouble scheduling my geography classes in a time efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I can only use the whiteboard, the textbook and a PDA as a medium.
I can also copy for free only at school (which is annoying for geography).
I just need a lot of time to plan my classes.
For example, we're doing the topic of geofactors right now, and I'm actually doing an hour of it.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
I usually start with the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and most of the tasks in the book I'm not quite satisfied with.
The working papers are also of this nature.
Maybe I can get a geography teacher to teach me how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd really like that.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the #NUMBER# order.
I have actually decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to get the returns done as soon as possible.
The retail sector is worried about the 2G regulations for Christmas shopping.
Most stores are now open only to those who have been vaccinated or recovered.
The trade sector considers this unnecessary and complains of a drop in sales.
He has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations are, in the view of the German Trade Association (HDE), ruining the retailers' important Christmas shopping.
The company's chief executive Stefan Genth said that sales of non-daily goods were falling.
According to a recent survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative view of the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas shopping.
"What should have been the highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit", Genth said.
Retailers with 2G restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis turnover in the past week.
The only good thing is the food retail and online sectors.
The Federation demanded consequences for the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene is a safe business, the CEO said.
"TwoG in shopping will not help us in the fight against the pandemic", he stressed.
The current regulations discouraged customers and required a high level of staffing.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should adopt a new proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure that the information provided by the Member States is not used to mislead consumers.
In addition, in retail, as in public transport, where the 3G rule is already in place (vaccinated, recovered or tested), random checks should be sufficient.
The German real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also described a difficult Christmas shopping spree.
Frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of the pre-corona level, sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall in the midst of the important Christmas shopping", CEO Wilhelm Wellner told Wirtschaftswoche.
The high staff and administrative burden is causing the centres to be tried and approved.
This includes the so-called "band-based solution" whereby "visitors can, for example, present their 2G ID at a central point in the centre once and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to that of a club hotel - enter all shops without being disturbed".
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG.
The mirror has a scratch and the frame also has a flaw that was tried to be hidden with a yellow filler.
This is not good.
I'd like to return the mirror and I've already wrapped it back in the package and pasted it on.
What do I do now to get back?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high colour reproduction.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is used to adjust the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the colour temperature in the range 3100-5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very bright stream of light with soft light of high quality, completely flickering-free.
The 120-degree angle of illumination, which allows you to illuminate large areas at relatively short distances, is excellent.
And by the way, even in reporter situations in small spaces or at short distances.
You can adjust the brightness with virtually no change in color temperature.
It's a great tool for both film sets and studio work.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the lamp to be remotely controlled in television studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, simply pressing one of the storage keys for a longer time occupies and completes.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
One of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate with low cost NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set up whether the batteries have sufficient power - it is a battery tester, built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlamp with continuous power from the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
It has a 16mm case for attachment, so you can attach it directly to your photo tripod.
The slope shall be reliably set by means of detectors on both sides.
Care has been taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for longevity and harsh use.
In addition, a hinged joint is included.
It's great that the package includes a bag.
This way you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small:
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a strong comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in the series, Hesse were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga playoff.
But then the SGE turned around, and within an hour, the frustration of a solid start to the season was gone, and they won furiously 5-2. "It's amazing what the guys did today", said DAZN coach Oliver Glasner, who gave a "full praise to everyone who was involved".
The first step was to find a new buffer for Frankfurt, which was still falling behind in ninth place.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusen team 2-0.
What happened next impressed the SGE coach, too.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance", Glasner continued.
I am extremely happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to get back on the court for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly high", said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we were gonna throw tonight.
Glasner wants to keep the focus on his future tasks, but he believes he is well placed to do so in terms of the personnel situation.
It's extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are physically in top condition.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players live with a high level of professionalism.
The aim is to "take it step by step and remain modest" and to "carry out the tasks at this level" by the end of the year.
The next game is scheduled for Wednesday at Borussia Mönchengladbach (8.30pm, Sky).
I'm about to get the e-mail that my package is coming back to you due to some mistake on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG and having it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait for the money to be returned and place the order again?
I'm afraid that would mean I won't order again because it's been a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampens for women's handball ahead of the quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's handball women are sneaking off the floor with their heads hanging and empty eyes after the humiliation against Denmark.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB team suffered a crushing defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent", said national coach Henk Groener.
We must take a different approach to Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game of all that we have to erase", said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to reach the semi-finals, a significant increase is needed against the 2019 World Cup runners-up on Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German pitcher in the match with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backfield player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack nor in the defense", admitted backfield player Xenia Smits, urging: "We have to look forward fast now".
From front to back not at height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the height of the whistle.
Misfires and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only the goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on the operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
However, this was not the initial ignition that was hoped for.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves on stage - and if they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was therefore early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since the back-row player Mia Zschocke was red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
She'll be back in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into play a little better and by the break had at least five goals.
The already dim hope of catching up after the switch was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Groener protectors sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-positioned opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer raise itself to a performance increase and went off the floor as a clear loser.

Is that okay with you?
The title says I work as a vaccination specialist in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered mainly in nursing homes.
And since these are almost finished, I'm going to go back to some of the vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g. "I take medicine X, is this compatible with the vaccination ...").
My responsibilities include providing information on vaccination, the indication status (a person is entitled to a vaccination according to the coronavirus vaccination guidelines and there are no reasons to object), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (this has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often have no pharmaceutical technicians, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of vaccines, who cannot (may?), but can not (may?), so I also do most of the vaccinations there myself.
The difficult question of the "Huidlerer": Amberger knows the solution
What is a "huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, has caused intense reflection in the British television program "We in Bavaria".
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host me?" was left unguessed by callers.
No, it wasn't "a man who's nervous".
And no one who has to do things fast.
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg then announced the solution, which probably surprised many Upper Palatinate residents.
"The Huidler", the audience experienced, "is a rag that someone wipes the oven with".
Dialectologist Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
The word "Houdern" is a word that is used in the Upper Palatinate.
This closed an educational gap - probably also among many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
It always comes after the confirmation with the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel, connected it to the PC, synced and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Tire selection on a racing bike-- really that safe?
This morning I woke up full of action, because I wanted to at least exercise a little more to prepare for my bike ride next week.
Said and done, and I drove off on my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really nice too - but then what lurks in every city centre (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Glass on the track.
Zack, loud hissing, and my rear tire wouldn't even go the rest of the way.
Because of the day of the week, I had no real way of getting a spare coat and a spare hose, so I had to turn around in a half-bad mood and take the first train home.
If the launching technique wasn't too bad, maybe it's better if I practice changing the tires before the bike ride.
But I have a question for you, and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance ahead of me over several days, I would very much prefer not to have this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because the old tyres from the previous owner (a very nice old man, had torn 120km off the day I came to pick up the bike until 2pm!) and who had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding them for several years.
But when I think about the fact that I have to change a tire after driving 80 to 90 kilometers, I think I'm in a really bad mood:D
I was talking to an elderly man at the platform, who asked me in amazement why I did not have the Marathon Plus tires, which are said to be non-playable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really that unbreakable?
I don't feel like spending 40 euros a tire just to be disappointed.
I'm still wondering, I'm on a racing bike right now, I think, 25x622.
These are also (apparently?) on the Marathon Plus tyres, but most are already wider.
Is that a problem?
Or would you recommend other tires for a racing bike in general?
The swallow side seems to me to be the absolute!
Thank you in advance for your help and my greetings.
Car slams into tree, driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old man had crashed his car on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten into a central island for an unexplained reason and then got into the opposite lane, police said.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old man.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man was trapped inside.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also be reintroduced.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and looks like the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this design proposal directly includes a properly designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
The principle makes the SOLO 15 very suitable for people where maximum volume is a rather minor concern but where an exceptionally high level of sound is to be achieved.
A 10-centimeter speaker simply cannot produce sound pressure levels that large, almost unfiltered.
But that doesn't mean that SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was tuned to SOLO 15 with a slight high pitch increase.
This is generally used in broadband to optimise the sharply increasing bundling of too high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is designed to be exactly as it is intended to be heard, and it is very clear and delicate.
A slight outward turn can reduce the pitch range and thus make the sound image warmer.
The point source makes it possible to pinpoint the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle with astonishing precision.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100-6 OHM, which are a reference, provide an enemy dynamic that is similar to its own.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to start by thinking about the final appearance of the speaker in order to plan for changes during construction.
For example, if the case is to be veneered, the speaker's lowering must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer is again applying material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), a hole of 8 mm should be drilled in the floor plate at the appropriate point to allow the cable to be passed through easily later.
The speaker hole in the front is now closed by means of a top mill, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
On the rear side, this opening should be fitted with a 45° phase to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four bolt points of the B 100-6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in Figure Detail phase.
Then you start the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued to these.
The three stiffnesses should also be used and glued.
The reinforcements themselves may vary in material thickness if necessary, for example if you want to use ready-made beams from the construction market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
The next step is to apply the second side.
Then all the plates of the foot, the two sides, and the front.
A suitable circular saw or a wood-cutter drill is used to facilitate the attachment of the openings of the bass reflector tube and the connecting clamps on the rear wall.
Then, using a round mill, round all the edges of the box.
The top of the foot plate can also be rounded.
The foot plate is then glued firmly to the base of the housing and further screwed with long wooden screws.
The next step is to mark and drill the screwing points of the speaker chassis and the connecting bolt (2,5 mm drill).
After cleaning the housing of wood dust (sucking/blowing), the cable is laid.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflector opening in the back wall.
The entire uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot to the terminal opening and left to protrude about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is carried to the speaker housing and is also hung loosely from it.
The frequency switches are then prepared and deployed.
The frequency switch design and the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document:
Once the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is bolted, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, is sealed.
The 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drip hot glue on the opening and close it.
The sealing can be checked by opening the B 100-6 OHM and using a small lamp.
Now, the sedation as described.
The B 100-6 OHM is then connected and bolted with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus wire (marked cable) must be welded to the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflector tube shall be cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For cushioning, a mat of the cushioning material is cut in two and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the basal reflex should be kept open.
Can I place an order now and not have it delivered until early June?
> Hello to all,
> finally we can announce that we will be hosting OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for reasons we know, we cannot get more than four people in the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per switch, so we'll be watching the 2021 Oscars with at least seven beans streaming and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic, and yet we're going to do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30
Now, put your drinks on hold, plan a nice meal, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
