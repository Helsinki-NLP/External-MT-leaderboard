A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says he knows of no one who would want to hurt him, stating: "Finally, things worked out for him".
The body, found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galizia, the San Francisco Coroner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and that an investigation is underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as a line chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A representative for Sons & Daughters said they were "appalled and shocked" by his death.
We have a small team working as a close family and he will be greatly missed, the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying in hostels at first, but that recently things were finally going well for him.
"He found an apartment and was dating a girl", Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man, and he had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected to his family was to cook for us, to make dinner, said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of controversy.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
"In a world where so much is wrong, she was a diamond in the rough, shining brighter every day", he said.
Anyone with information about this matter is requested to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline at 415-575-4444.
Practitioners on strike: demands for new labour measures
The representatives of the medical practitioners have asked their trade union to approve new labour action measures in their dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association's Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) is calling on the whole Council to support new labour action measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC says that the ministers have failed to address the concerns about the agreement.
In July, medical practitioners and medical students voted to reject the contract with the BMA.
Fifty-eight percent of the members who voted rejected it.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government had been "persistent in its silence" about the issues that she said led to the rejection of the deal.
He said: In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject the proposed new agreement completely and to demand formal renegotiations on all your concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to authorize a gradual and expanded labour strike program to begin in early September.
The controversy has led to six strikes by medical practitioners this year, including the first complete strike in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA's medical practitioners, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote rejected the terms of the contract negotiated by the BMA.
He had told the BMA members in meetings before the 54,000 medical trainees and students voted that the deal was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be prescribed to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
A gesture that ended in crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions officially over.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
Yes, there was a handshake.
But Putin's smile looked violent, and he showed little sign of warmth, even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke constantly about his "dear friend" Putin - five times, according to one report.
I messed up my math.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not only to pre-crisis levels but even better.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the radiant coolness of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: the shooting down by Turkey of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
The reaction from Moscow at the time was furious.
Putin attacked, blaming Ankara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led an astonishing, thorough assault on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had profited from the illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
He's been very adamant about not doing this.
But the official message in St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia has achieved some kind of victory.
The benefits of a hard truce are clear.
Firstly, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost ousted in a failed coup last month.
The continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
The economic sanctions imposed by Russia have been heavy, in particular the ban on charter flights, which normally bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has dropped by almost 90 percent.
As for Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will surely be relieved when flights finally resume.
They're hoping for a late-season run into the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after the re-authorization of agricultural imports from Turkey.
Tourists go there, tomatoes come back here, as the report in the newspaper Vedemosti put it.
But the visit also had a political added value for Moscow.
There is a lot of anger in the West about what is seen as a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this a long-standing grudge over the snail-like pace of EU membership negotiations, and Putin steps forward eager to exploit his coolness and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly got a break from Ankara, where he called after the coup attempt to support the appointed authorities.
Of course, this is a clear message to Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in a lavish seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to introduce the Outsiders' Alliance, as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
However, the two have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It may be telling that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the matter.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can find common ground on Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full-blown catastrophe if a NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two leaders are at least speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from non-Scottish customers
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's international objectives.
After the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued, it has abandoned these objectives.
The bank's strategists have used the RBS trademark to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds spent on international sports sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it's been seen as right to let the more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is operating with Scottish customers but will not be restarted from scratch.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, except for head office and listings, are renamed NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that are gaining more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holts Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a client and staff tour in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: The RBS brand will become our investor brand and the employer of our employees, because we are now becoming much more of a brand bank.
As the bank became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under those brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer sponsor the Six Nations and has raised the profile of various brands in its sports sponsorship.
It is time for us to move towards a brand bank, because at its core (we have asked) it is about how we can focus on making it a better bank for customers, the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank to our customers and offer these brands.
But with the work we've done, focusing on the needs of the customers, not our own, I think you're going to see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brandy back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection and reaches 3,000 in profit
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice, he has a total of 3,000.
Racehorse racer Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone with his second victory of the night at home, competing for the Predilection, coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the sport of thoroughbred horse racing.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson. He's also the first to be named to the Hall of Fame.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who won the Ghayyar earlier, said: "This is special".
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I started 30 years ago.
This is not a big event, this is not Royal Ascot, this is a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humbled.
Dettori is sucking the cheers out of himself as he puts the Predilection on the podium after his victory.
Two riders have reached this milestone in the hurdles - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had a record breaking career of over 4,300 wins.
Lester Piggot, nine-time Derby winner, has won 4,493.
Frankie is one of the best racehorses of the modern era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactful wit sets him apart in the weight room.
He's a great ambassador for the competition, and his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Frank a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he hadn't been a weekend jockey and a big race driver!
Seriously, Frankie has been riding winners in the UK for most of the last 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a lively person, which is good for British racing, but he's also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a flying landing on a saddle that became his trademark.
From flying stops to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British thoroughbred horse racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster ride.
He amassed victories in major races, including his famous Magnificent Seven win at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and suffered a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had a rough start when he returned from a six-month suspension, but he showed remarkable strength of character in challenging the skeptics and returning in top form.
And he may be able to continue for a long time to come, because Dettori has said before that he wants to continue racing until he's at least 50.
Russia 's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed the head of the Russian military, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement said that Putin had ordered Ivanov to step down as head of the Russian presidential administration, but gave no reason for this.
As of 2012, Ivanov's Deputy Director, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
The victim, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, in 2012, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
He was also a member of the 'Russian parliament' and 'the Russian parliament'.
When he was appointed, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust".
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your work as head of state in drafting laws and in managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended that Vaino be appointed in his place.
Are you sure about the smiles?
This is a move that has baffled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served in the Soviet security service KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin broadcast on state television, both men claimed that the chief of staff had stepped aside at his own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, few here are convinced, especially now, just before the general election.
So this is just the aftermath of some sort of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once touted as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been met with great scepticism.
In comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a discussion to give me four years' responsibility for this very complex, if you can even call it a job, task.
Well, I've been chief of staff for four years and eight months now.
Ivanov accepted the assignment in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Security Council of Russia and a former member of the State Security Service KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the State Security Service, the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy head.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
At one time, it was thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Putin after his second term, because Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this task went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he returned to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson was fired for beating up a producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation last month on the set of the show in Los Angeles.
The show's producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his firing was announced.
There were creative differences and arguments on set.
I regret that it happened", he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details on how Gibson's character will be removed from the series about the FBI team of agents will be expected later.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have given it everything I have for the past 12 years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but now it's not possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the cast, our incredible team, and most of all, the best fans the show can have.
The start of the 12th production season of the series is scheduled for 28 September.
The mystery novels ended up in the garden at Banff .
A man in Banff has asked for help identifying fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be wind fish left behind by the water wheel.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the ocean, posted video footage of the apparition on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing crossing, now extending into Fife
The £1.35bn project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern end of the Queensferry crossing with a drawbridge, which means that the bridge now extends into Fife.
It is the first of four locks between the "crow's nest" that are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of barbed wire.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said: 'This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We all witness a truly impressive engineering feat in this project, which has involved more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel for the construction of this section of the bridge alone.
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the bridge deck and bridge deck is a demanding task, requiring extremely precise measurements.
In all, almost 79% of the deck is now in place and the last part of the deck is being poured into concrete today at Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be put back on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager at Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure of any bridge project is always a major milestone.
In this fantastic project, this fence represents the cutting edge of building technology.
After the last section of the road was installed and connected to the expanding northbound road, we had to close the remaining section from the north, or inland, side.
This was done by pulling the northbound roadway 700 millimeters south.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding operation.
It was enormous, for the earthen bridge is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled at an angle of incline of about 3%.
This was a challenge because the measurement deviations allowed by the team were small, only a few millimeters in each direction.
But luckily, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: three men are lucky to be alive
Three men are lucky to be alive after falling from their fishing boat off the coast of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station issued an alert at 1.20pm (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event unfold in Moelfre Bay.
Three men tried desperately to swim to safety as their boat continued on on its own.
"We saw the boat circling closer to the men and we thought the worst", said Vince Jones, the helmsman of the Moelfre rescue boat.
"Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got underway", he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, aged 60, was found exhausted hanging from the boy without life jackets.
The men were taken to a coastal rescue boat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: "These three men who were in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a kill switch, but it was somehow detached from the person who was driving the boat when the boat went down.
Somebody took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable pursuit of health and happiness.
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
During the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play but are spending their leisure time watching television.
Pokémon Go gets people off the couch and into something.
Watching was originally limited to television, then video games, and now recently smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to a wild game called Pokémon Go, an application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later to become a comic book series, trading cards and other products).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity had waned somewhat before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the game's release in other countries was delayed because the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
There were only days when Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
As explained in the nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and that can be photographed (using a screenshot of the phone) or searched after being found.
The generation that played the game when they were younger has joined the fray and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, gambling has led to a significant increase in the average person's daily steps.
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's release, the number of people who were moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent of users tracked by Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, they just see training data.
Many public health campaigns have failed to deliver on the messages "Get 30", "Get off the couch", and "Be active every day" because most public health warnings are boring and are given by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Regular exercise reduces the risk of cancer and depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, and diabetes, and its benefits are too numerous to list here.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people to go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As usual, the resentful revelers are looking for something to complain about.
Yeah, someone could walk in the door.
What's the point?
There's been a breakthrough.
And while there were apps like Fitbit that were used to track your activity, they didn't give you a reason to move the way this game did.
The fascination with novelty disappears and the use fades with time.
However, the success of Pokémon will lead to other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunter-lovers to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles won gold in the women's gymnastics all-around.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all of that.
He's got a lot of energy jumping around.
It's a smooth ride.
I can't believe the amount of permafrost.
It's great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast won the all-around championship on Thursday, exposing the gulf between herself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of silver medalist and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States balances the balance beam in the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win back-to-back world championships in the sport of mixed martial arts and the fifth American champion overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps of all time.
He broke down in tears as his final score was announced, and his long journey toward this moment was over.
This achievement puts him in the same category as other top athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated the sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold, in programs that have combined ambition and precision to such an extent that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen".
The final test was in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the other competitors but between him and the burden of overwhelming expectations.
Coming back to the family home in Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman of the United States hug after winning gold and silver medals (in that order) in the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Dec. 23.
Biles won his first medal on Tuesday, when he served as the centerpiece at the kick-off party for retired national team coordinator Martha Karolin.
Although Biles claimed that he never thought about the future on his long journey to the top, that is not entirely true.
Part of his permanent program - which includes his trademark volt shift - is set to Latin American music that would be perfect for a street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted as a baby by her grandparents and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother while she was on a field trip to the gym where Boorman coached, has become a force to be reckoned with.
He hasn't lost a multi-game since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak will continue as long as Biles wants it to.
Even though Mustafina was a little ahead after two rounds, it was just a delusion.
The balance beam and the permanent, with Biles as reigning world champion, were waiting.
He topped the list with 15,433 points and surpassed them with 15,933 per cent.
Raisman gave her a good-natured hug as they waited for the end points, a mere formality, and tears rose in Biles' glittering red, white and blue eyes as a dream she once wrote her scrapbook about came true.
Raisman's performance was a rematch of four years ago when he was tied for third, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the repechage.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call "Grandma", was clearly in the lead.
He sent flying kisses to the audience after his performance in Perm, in a rush of emotion about a comeback that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for the party, the 19-year-old's widely shared tweet earlier this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Three victims of a serial murder were shot while listening to music in their car .
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killing in a decade were sitting in their car talking and listening to music when they were shot, police said in a statement Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on a freeway on June 12.
The report says that the gunman, standing on the passenger side of the car, fired his handgun up to eight times and then fled in another vehicle.
Police say the triple homicide doesn't appear to be the result of a robbery, since the assailant didn't take the handbags or the $2,900 that was with the other adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look into whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks over four months, mainly in two Latin American cities.
"These are happening in the residential area in front of my house", Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have been driving a number of vehicles, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a late 1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to release evidence that would lead them to conclude that the attacks are connected and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, were pronounced dead at the scene.
A witness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also issued a police report on the shooting, which occurred just half an hour before the triple homicide and targeted an empty van, also believed to be the work of a serial killer.
Forensics found bullet casings, a bullet in the seat, and shrapnel in the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: The situation is getting better
Edmund Picciuto, like most six-year-olds, loves to sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund is short-headed, a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, was unaware of when she was pregnant.
When he first came home, my first thought was, "I can't do this".
I can't do this. I can't.
I didn't promise you this.
Which is not true at all, of course I promised, he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them and might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be institutionalized.
"My first reaction was that I didn't know people were still doing it", Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't speak.
But he's slowly reaching some milestones.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
Besides, he loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth is showing us how Edmund's gestures are used to say, "Sing to me".
"We're teaching him sign language", Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not just any sign language. He says Edmund has invented some of his own.
Microcephalus can be caused by a number of different things, from genetic, as in Edmund's case, to viral infections during pregnancy, such as smallpox or Zika.
The symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
It's too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future.
I just asked what's gonna happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know, actually.
I haven't actually asked for a prediction in a while because I don't expect anyone to actually be able to give me one.
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect from Zika.
It's getting easier.
You can trust me, things are gonna get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding prompted rescue operations in Mississippi, Louisiana
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have overflowed, causing widespread flooding as a result of extremely heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already coming to the counties in need.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's Office of Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said they're getting requests for floating vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood watch is in effect until Saturday over much of southern Louisiana.
The National Weather Service said in a statement that an additional three to five centimeters of rain is expected in the area.
A flood watch was in effect in southern Alabama on Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both in Louisiana and were forecast to set record highs over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat of flooding in Ascension County, which is located on the lower river, is lower as flooded rivers slowly flow into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at its highest level on record at nine o'clock on Friday morning.
Rescuers are still pulling people out of floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloucester on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
She says that another stepson, who lives nearby, warned her.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising", Hansford said.
It went all the way up to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she had never seen the stream at such a height in the 48 years she had lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members all have disabilities and that he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued the three in a large, military-style truck and took them to the Gloucester Fire Station, where the rescued stayed overnight Friday.
Krautmann says that the floods will spread quickly as the heavy rains continue and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says a witness near Livingston reports 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely engulfed by the heavy rain that had been pouring since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding in the streets led to evacuations of residents in Tangipahoa County and cancellations of classes in five school districts, officials said.
CBS affiliate WWL reports that in Tangipahoa, a city council member said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now under flood.
County president Robby Miller said that authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by the rising waters.
The towns of Amiten and Hammond have been opened to shelter for those who have been evacuated.
"They will be allowed to return to their homes when the water starts to fall", he said.
In Hammond, Tangipahoa County, twenty streets were closed because of rising water, and residents were forced to pick up sandbags to try to keep water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood here was in March", said city manager Lacy Landrum.
This is about to be a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said that steady rain continued along the Gulf Coast.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported flooded, but so far on Friday there have been no reports of flooding.
Keith Townson, the head of Shopper Value Foods in Amity, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before", Townson said, "and it's still raining".
" Full of bullets , " six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives a shooting in Philadelphia .
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, making this the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that his name was Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, arm, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He was in a lot of pain, his little body was full of bullets", his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe this.
The hospital has listed the boy as critically ill and has performed several surgeries.
The family is telling the station that he's expected to make a full recovery.
The boy was about to start his first year at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three other men were also shot: two 29-year-old and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car with a 29-year-old man in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators are telling CBS Philadelphia that it appears there was a crossfire between multiple shooters.
The assault rifle casings, which are from different assault weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a constant battle.
There were shells in the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
"It appears there were several armed fighters here and they were in active combat", Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and police are investigating the surveillance footage.
Another six-year-old girl was accidentally shot in the hand on Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's in recovery, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's what I call this year's Olympic women's gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been this dominant.
And second, this team has three athletes, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have inspired many girls of color.
The composition of this team, which is complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It has also cemented the presence of black and Hispanic women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the most successful female bodybuilder in the world has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is so awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised the world with an Olympic medal and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who have put on unexpected but championship fitness programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win consecutive individual gold in the women's singles.
And my teammate Aly Raisman took silver.
We're seeing the pinnacle of the sport, but it doesn't look like this in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path that Aly and Madison took to make the Olympic team.
They are the Final Five (last five) because the next Olympics gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year as coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts usually train in private gyms run by parents who pay for training, facilities, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and so on.
Many of these gyms are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the sport.
These clubs provide gymnasts with all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez' coach, have both been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible physical education to the communities where the many young girls who inspire Simon, Gabby and Laurie live.
I started my gym foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we've provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Latino) and trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality fitness for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop physical strength, flexibility, and coordination, as well as mental hard work, discipline, and determination.
This combination offers lifelong benefits in good health and academic and workplace success.
This team's inspiration is getting thousands of young girls to start gymnastics, and it's amazing.
Participating in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live in exciting times.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing the seriousness of your "girl power" by winning the Olympic team gold and for inspiring so many young girls from different backgrounds to embark on the path to healthy, strong and successful young women.
Practitioners are organising new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt 's proposal .
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the 37,000 medical practitioners who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the deal, saying the NHS was "on uncharted territory" and that even small additional delays would hurt staff and patients.
The first trainees will be transferred to a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend working practices to improve care during the peak hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's Medical Practitioners Committee, said in a statement last night: "Practitioners continue to have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, particularly that it exacerbates the existing labour crisis and does not treat all doctors equally".
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
The BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have been met with reluctance and at times deep silence from the government.
I did this despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the ban and address the concerns of medical practitioners.
If he doesn't, the trainees are ready to continue the work-struggle.
The latest strike, in late April, involved almost 13,000 routine operations and 100 000 adjournments as nurses and consultants were recruited to replace doctors on strike duty.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants a better weekend pay for the 54,000 trainee doctors under contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, appealed to trainee doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: Work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation and cause worry, anxiety and disruption for patients, carers and their families.
Over the past two months, we have been in discussions with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive discussion on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, further training for sabbatical returnees, training costs, mutual recognition of curriculum, tuition fees and gender pay gaps in medicine - would be a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health are about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day of medication can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from the £2.50 a day drug after authorities recommended that it be given to humans for longer.
A medicine called ticagrelor, which prevents blood clots, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
It is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another attack.
NHS regulator NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to still lower the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS regulator, NICE, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to still lower the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people in England have a heart attack each year, and a quarter of these have another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a buildup of fat in the wall of the artery, which forms constrictions.
If the narrowing ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot comes loose, it can travel through the blood and cut off blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is made by AstraZeneca in the UK and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
A draft NICE guideline published today recommends that humans be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE's Centre for Health Technology Assessment, said: Despite the availability of effective preventive treatments, up to a quarter of people who have a heart attack later have another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences.
Fear of being reborn can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By recommending ticagrelor in the first instance, we are pleased to be able to increase the number of treatment options available to the several thousand people who may benefit from them.
Because of limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, particularly regarding the risk of bleeding, for periods longer than three years, treatment beyond this period is not recommended in the draft guidelines.
The culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas.
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, giving impetus to the government's report.
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, a shocking government report reveals today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles has lashed out at police, election officials and city councils for ignoring evidence of election fraud because of racial and religious hypersensitivity.
The former secretary of the community, now the anti-corruption emperor, said that religious intimidation of voters is so serious that the police should be allowed to put security chains outside polling stations to protect fearful voters.
He recommends that voters should present identification cards when voting to prove who they are.
Today, all a voter has to do is state his name and address.
The report even suggests that permanent ink be put on the voter's finger so that no one can vote twice.
Sir Eric says whistleblowers should be better protected.
He called for greater access for the press to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working parties.
This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but would also protect local government from the wider culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud, he said.
The report was commissioned by the government in the wake of the Tower Hamlets vote scandal.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following numerous allegations of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found Rahman had cynically distorted the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 votes were questionable or the result of a person voting in the guise of someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He raised particular concerns about electoral fraud in the postal vote, where senior members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for their candidate.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations for cleaning up the voting system, including proof of identity with ID.
He said in his report: 'Evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote in accordance with the wishes of the elders, especially in communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
 Concerns were expressed that...the state institutions had ignored such behaviour because of the politically correct racial and religious hypersensitivity.
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballots to stop the vote-taking.
The report, which Theresa May is reviewing, also calls for stricter checks on registrants to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for verifying voters' identity before voting.
Use permanent ink on the voter's finger so that no one can vote twice.
Systematically check their nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit on requests for voting by automatic mail.
Prevent political activists from handling ready-made votes received by mail and envelopes in which to send them.
Let the police put up chains of guards around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it's easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures at polling stations.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that voters must go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric is teasing the Greater London Police saying it's "amazing" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets incident.
The electoral court will remain as a result of numerous corrupt and illegal actions by Lutfur Rahman and his officials, he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds, beyond a reasonable doubt, according to the criminal justice threshold.
He also criticised the ineffective 'check-in' checks in the voting registers of municipal councils.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's Tower Hamlets judgment was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as the birthplace of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of facts by certain groups threatens this good reputation.
Mad about Kate the biker twin and other celebrity appearances at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the 2016 Rio Olympics have been baffled by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be an impressive double for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic delegate is certainly not the only athlete this summer fighting for gold who can boast of his famous double - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, of the U.S. men's archery team, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's twin on the bike path, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter after images surfaced of him looking eerily similar to the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, in becoming aware of the social media hype, the archer admitted that since he was a child, he's heard that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance, except maybe in the beard", Brady told the Huffington Post.
He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons to London in 2012 is sure to come up again this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been described as a double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Bigger switch to the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the sporty version of the Inception actor
Another long-standing comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similarly strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shares more with actress Annalynne McCord than tan skin and blond hair, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian is described by fans as "a sports version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, share similar facial features and eyes
Not only that: One Twitter user was very happy that others saw the similarities
Theoretical: This user believes that the similarity between the two may be due to
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness that some on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.
And the American football star and Dexter's actress have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings, whose smile is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and gold medalist gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose beautiful broad smile matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC's Olympic commentator apologizes after saying a Chinese swimmer "died like a pig".
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay on Wednesday angered viewers of the CBC live Olympic broadcast.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize after a reporter said that during the race a 14-year-old Chinese girl "disappeared like a stench" and "died like a pig".
News anchor Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own thoughts on the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC news team to bring "color", was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China was dumb, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, giving Canada a chance to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online, shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old swimmer in China "died like a pig"???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air.
Ai Yanhan, from China, was pictured in the women's 4 x 200 meter freestyle final as saying: "That little 14-year-old from China was goofing, baby".
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was fierce and quick, with many challenging him.
Twitter users couldn't help but hear how careless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusting.
Shortly thereafter, CBC host Scott Russell apologized on live television for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We're sorry that the swim performance comment got on the air.
It was a regrettable choice of words, and we regret that it has happened.
CBC ended up apologizing over 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
And it was my reporter Scott Russell who had to apologize for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and pasted the apology to over 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The network also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were broadcast live.
We took swift action last night and apologized live to our viewers and social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not about him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and regrettable choice of words, and Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on live television and tried to clarify his comment by saying that he did not mean it to be construed as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this time for the comment I made last night after the women's message", she said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person.
I don't think it's necessary to say that I didn't mean it disrespectfully and that I'm really sorry.
A customer at Primark is shocked to see a woman brazenly fitting underwear in the middle of a mall.
Customers didn't know what to look for when she stripped in the middle of a Primark store to try on underwear.
Not only did she not feel better about how she looked in her pants, but she took them off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to tour and eventually matched four pairs of underwear at a store located in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
A woman in a boutique at Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone, where she was fitting underwear and then putting it back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the time, said that after trying on the underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed up again and walked out of the store without buying anything".
He said, "People couldn't believe their eyes".
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of underwear on display, took off her own socks and underwear, and put on a fitting.
He didn't even try to find a remote place to reconcile, he just stood there shamelessly.
Everyone was watching as she took off her underwear again and obviously didn't like it because she put it back on the shelf.
He did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding that he didn't like anything he saw, put on his clothes again, and walked out.
He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear he was fitting.
Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think of someone taking home underwear that someone else has tried but hasn't cleaned".
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I thought the staff were obviously trying to remove the clothes from sale after she left, which is fine".
It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off, and they have not been washed.
A representative for Primark said: Primark is aware of an incident that occurred in the Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9.
All products in question have been withdrawn from the market.
This is how you can defend yourself against armed attack using Krav Maga .
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrach, the New York City-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-wielding robbers at close range.
Whether you're approached from the front or from behind, this video shows you how to pay off your attacker in equal measure.
Mizrach says if you're approached from behind, the first thing you do is turn around so you can see your attacker and break the line of fire.
Then you grab the gun between your elbow and your shoulder before you hit the assailant in the face with your free elbow.
Keep hitting with your knee to your thighs, and as the attacker goes from pain to pain, twist the gun from his hands, hit him with the back of the gun in the face, and then back away with the gun pointed at him.
If an armed person is approaching from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the weapon, and turn it around so that the criminal cannot fire.
At the same time, put your weight on the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon from his grip, back up and point the weapon at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does this exactly.
But remember, unless you're a Krav Maga grandmaster, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for his guidebook
A British traveler has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflex by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most night-breaking places.
Suffolk-based broadcaster and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, a railway railing at Piccadilly Circus, a toilet flush button on a train, and a Russian pay phone to prove his immune system.
Before licking each subject, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to be put into.
However, the experiment, which was made into a movie called The Force Within, produced surprising results.
The thought of licking the sink of a train used by thousands of people may seem totally repulsive, but the truth is that the kitchen sink contains more bad bacteria.
While traveling through Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the licks she took left anything but a bad taste in her mouth.
Wright became known as a test-taker of his gut as he traveled the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, from the railing of public railway stations to the flush button on the toilet seat, really tested his immune system.
In the film, he said: "Since I was a child, I have been quite careless about my health, and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, from dirt and worms to dirty water".
He really cemented his reputation during the movie.
The only thing she wouldn't do was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample had a photometer reading of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, the freshly washed hand count should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet, he refused to lick when the photometer showed more than 4,000 units and the freshly washed hands less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler film, The Inner Power Trail, with a Finnish dairy farmer, Valio, which shows the amount of bacteria in different places, like the bathroom.
In the movie, the bride said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the bathroom".
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's night-time.
The internal power traces were produced in conjunction with a Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valium Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to boost human gut bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of Snacks, Juices and New Categories at the Choice, said: 'We really wanted to offer something new to consumers.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We were throwing around a lot of crazy ideas, and we came up with this idea, "Let's call Ian".
They claim that concern for gut health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
So instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context, telling people about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we can inform consumers in an interesting way.
I also think the documentary shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The documentary's director, Tom Hakala, added: Let's put it this way: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him to, like the night-time Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost respect for him.
Understandably, some of the licking was easier for Ian, while some was quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks saved.
In a 2015 survey by Valio, 84% of respondents specifically linked lactic acid bacteria to gut health and 58% said they at least occasionally use products with lactic acid added.
The family of the robber destroyed a tenement house in Saltash, Cornwall, before they were evicted.
The bully family caused £50,000 in damage to their tenement house after they were evicted because of the terrorization of their neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their property in Saltash, Cornwall after being repeatedly criticized.
After they were forcibly removed, the housing company's officers, shocked, found the property in poor condition.
The walls were drilled with holes, the floorboards were torn, the trash was scattered on the floor, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family has now moved away and are believed to be living in a private residence.
Conna McEvoy, the owner of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid the property would not be able to be repaired.
He said: 'This has been a nightmare for the people and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There are many things to consider here, as this property is probably best known for its less pleasant Cornish groups.
This family is notorious, and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived in the property on and off, and police said the family's atrocities included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidating neighbors, drug use, drug dealing, and excessive shouting, fighting, and swearing.
47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, was sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
Many of the rooms in the house under threat of demolition were found to contain old debris.
The property from which drugs have been previously transported, the floorboards were pulled up.
Neighbors said that the family was seen fighting in the street and that police were regularly called to the scene.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted a woman and her partner from their property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
Relieved, the neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone".
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
We've seen the police here an incredible number of times.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We got up because it was so quiet in here, we're not used to it!
It's wonderful now that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the neighborhood manager for Cornwall Housing, said the family had not cooperated with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and police were called to the property often.
Trash and old toys have been dumped on the wild wall of the tenement house.
He added: 'It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's behaviour, as eviction is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have horrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police and the brave community members who have given us the information.
I hope this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived on the property at different times, but they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms after the fire .
Housing company employees now have to clean up the garbage piles surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 grams of cannabis, along with a scale, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a class B drug with intent to distribute.
He claimed the money was intended for the gravestone of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partner are homeless now, having frozen in a private residence in Plymouth.
There was graffiti on the walls of many rooms of the house.
Police say they're trying to evict residents who disregard the terms of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
'This is a message to those who think their behaviour is without consequences, and to those who suffer from it,' he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with our partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew over the beach at low altitude
Sun-worshiping tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane was swept by from a very low altitude.
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
Just then, panicked tourists began to panic as a low-flying jet swept over the crowded beach.
The dramatic video shows a military plane coming within close range of sun worshippers on a sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up when they began to be understandably concerned about the noise from the jet, although they did not at first see what was coming toward them from behind the clouds.
The incident took place on the Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the many holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic bypass on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: It passed twice at very low altitude, and at one point it looked like it was going to crash.
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I really felt like the plane was falling on me".
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared in the dark and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of a P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast and had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown considerably lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby fires, but the Air Force assured that no one's safety was in danger.
This summer, wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly at low visibility conditions, due to smoke from the fires and thick fog,
The aircraft was on a training flight and as part of the exercise the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
The first half of the year is better than expected
The South Karelian Social and Health District (Eksote) exceeded its target of EUR 3.4 million in January - June.
Expote's profit was EUR 4,3 million in the first half of the year.
The results were particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has helped to break down institutional care.
The guarantee of care was implemented in all operations.
This year, the Exote will try to cut the lines.
The ex-ante surplus covers the deficit that was previously created.
The remainder may be used to reduce queues and purchase procedures for patients.
The full year's result is expected to be EUR 4,6 million better than planned.
The ECOFIN Council will consider the half-yearly review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border guards took the oath of military service in Imola
Seventy enlisted men from the Coast Guard and Coast Guard Academy took the oath of service on Friday.
The military ceremony for the Border and Coast Guard School of Cadets was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Patrol Whaling School was held at the Garrison Sports Ground.
70 of the soldiers took the oath of allegiance.
Border specialists are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat roles.
They serve 347 days a year.
This year, 310 young people applied for the special border patrol.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special border guards have been trained at Immola since 2007.
The ceremony was attended by five wartime veterans of the frontier troops.
The average age of those involved is now 90.
The oldest veterans who have attended the event were born in 1918.
A little bit of a robbery ahead - Crime detection helps solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police departments has operated an RTA, or Crime Intelligence and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible to the outside world.
The Hämeen police station has a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinn.
It's being pulled by a sergeant stationed at the Bay.
The head of the unit is the Lieutenant in the Bay.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinn.
They all work in civilian clothes.
The unit has shown its usefulness and its necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the other police.
In the process, it has obtained information on asylum seekers, among other things.
The most recent reform of working practices
The creation of the analysis units is the latest reform of the police's working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, so that the police will rarely go to the scene and call only when they receive an alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the unit will direct daily policing activities where they are most needed.
The reform of the police administration led to the establishment of a single crime-intelligence centre, three national units under it and a separate crime-intelligence unit for each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in the Vantaa area under the auspices of the Central Criminal Police, is responsible for national operations.
The PTR units are staffed, as their name suggests, by people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas allocated to police departments and are responsible for providing information to both local and national police forces.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory.
Whereas an individual officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit is aware of what is happening throughout the police station.
Intelligence also extends beyond the confines of one's own agency, as does crime.
The people who work in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the regular police.
The unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive or similar crimes by means of registers, alert database and observations.
This is called ranking, and it's one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
Every person has their own way of doing things.
You can see the fingerprint on the job, whether it's honest or criminal.
The way it's done, it creates a certain image of the perpetrator.
Sorting can be done either by the method of crime or by the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
RTA employees don't walk around town with their collars up, but their work isn't exactly public.
The methods used by both the criminals and themselves are not disclosed, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to hinder police efforts to combat crime.
The police shall make public the methods used if they foresee that they will pose a threat.
One such case was the one reported in the early summer of the use of the "empty sign" in home burglaries.
In it, the perpetrators placed a stick, a button-point, or a piece of tape on the apartment's front door to test whether the residents were really traveling.
The investigation material shall be made public at least to the parties.
The analysis unit has found that even the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest of them will order a court report, which may reveal, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go after the thieves with gloves on.
For the case, Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppäs Hämeen from the police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepolaa from the Eastern Finland Police, Crime Commissioner Sami Joutjärveä from the Joensuu Police Station and Crime Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Crime Police were interviewed.
The police collect and analyse information to help them plan their actions.
The background is a decline in the labour force and in funding.
The first steps towards a new way of working were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-stage reform of the PORA, which ended at the end of 2013.
The national cooperation is aimed at collecting information from outside the institution and the Finnish borders.
A school girl from London who joined ISIS was killed in Syria .
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, is rumored to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the girl's family heard she died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, the group's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
One can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and testament to others that there are real risks involved in going to a war zone - that it could discourage people from making such a decision, Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family was told that the girl had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and that she had been widowed after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton would consider Garland a Supreme Court nominee if she was elected.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president.
Senate Republicans have been blocking Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose a person to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Anton Scalia.
Reid said on a Thursday phone call that he predicted "with some degree of certainty" that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether to nominate Garland and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "impact the boat" with a new selection.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said that the Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "supporters" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is for women as much as men.
Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirelli's 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're going to find the next generation of top stars on their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats chairman Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his strip magazine, which is full of nudity, is different from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them, too.
"We need to start presenting timeless and classic nudity again where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of naked women's bodies", Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can leave pictures online or in person at open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
The destination of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Single, middle-aged men are into vinyl records.
Before you rush to fill the comment section with the angry insults of a man named NotAllSingleMiddle-AgedMen, note that this claim is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked-about resurgence of records is not because more millennials are getting excited about the novelty of physical objects but because of the craziness of middle age.
Apparently, the most likely people to buy a vinyl record recently are between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, the most unlikely to buy a record are those between the ages of 18 and 24.
It is also not just about amateur collecting, but also about emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions in (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy solitude (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk down a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit, pointing vigorously before stopping, forming a cup from my hands, and saying something authoritative, such as: "Let's look into it".
Let's take a closer look.
While the glamour and dirt of Soho are slowly being removed - hotels, chain restaurants and stores, and office supply stores now fill the buildings that once housed independent stores - a handful of magnificent specialized record stores still remain.
For the next part, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment, as I stand very close to a variety of men in some of these stores, trying to judge by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (calculator: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (calculator: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her twenties), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting, touring stores to spend a few hours.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
"Of course I am", he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These discs, shown in the picture above (she emailed the image, I didn't follow her home), cover the walls of her living room.
The reason for this huge number of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: he can now buy records that he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can buy back those he sold when he was young and penniless.
Most of the material I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s, records that were released when I was 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to buy, he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: "I don't smoke and don't drink much.
This is my bad.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers she meets fit the YouGov profile.
But he's noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media's enthusiasm, people who have heard that records are back in fashion and who have become compelled to buy their old records back.
Based on the conversations I've had, people have been getting rid of their collections, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back, he says.
This may explain the increase in vinyl revivals in certain age groups.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of the records?
In a store like Phonika, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores provide a comforting community for like-minded guys.
Weiz also pointed out that some older customers have been particularly affected by the local payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be puzzled by the digital world and choose to rely on the durability of familiar record sleeves, items that evoke memories of happy teenage years.
I think sometimes it can be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort that ownership creates, says Wez.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I think it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" another worker said suddenly from the record cover.
An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of vinyl buyers do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I'd probably look seriously worried as I browsed the pile of bossa nova collections.
This reward aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (calculator: three middle-aged men), has also noticed.
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
It's not a big deal, but it's definitely going to happen.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player".
So not the older people, but the younger people, the late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
Fopp, which now has almost an entire floor devoted to vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than the establishments mentioned earlier, the speakers are filled with the latest synth- and sex-heavy pop from Wild Beast, not improvised jazz, so it's great to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but the devastating psychological trauma is hard to prove by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes looking at the various records on sale.
He's out window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so record collecting isn't really an option.
It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but the beauty of vinyl is... he sighs in love.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique.
My last stop is said to have spawned a new generation of vinyl lovers:
While trying to look like I'm looking at jeans, I notice a group of teenage girls gather around Polaroid cameras for a moment before the father and daughter decide to buy Crosley's record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac records: a mix of contemporary and classical, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that they would be impossible to touch.
It's purely "art vinyl".
But considering that even the slightest attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the Soho slums to get more, there's not much to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items, such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are valid, at least in the Soho record stores, they don't rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday mornings wandering around Berwick Street record stores, sifting through records, and avoiding the creepy, 30-year-old fake TV host who stares over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The holly is the longest-living vertebrate in the world - video report
Scientists say the holler has the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Shark researcher Julius Nielsen says that the record belongs to a female shark believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and that it measures 15 feet [5 m] long.
French court rejects application to dismantle shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a request by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of convenience stores and restaurants in the Jungle camp, which houses thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais Prefecture argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a tax-free parallel economy and because they are a fire and clean-up risk.
Aid groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by the state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the camp's growing population.
They reasoned that convenience stores and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals to those in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for evicting 72 people from a temporary shop but said that the prefect of Calais' concern was fully understandable.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants had a much bigger role than just feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions.
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat was the camp's Jungle Book Kids Cafe, a nonprofit that provides 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum counseling for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
The letter to the Guardian said that closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as eight years old.
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 - a peak - after a surge in arrivals during the summer.
Food prices in Finland fall significantly faster than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are falling sharply, much to the delight of consumers and the chagrin of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by almost 5% in three years, compared with an average decrease of 0.9% in the EU.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has risen in price by 1 percent.
Over the past three years, Finland has seen the second-highest decline in food prices among EU countries with similar wage levels.
Only in the UK, a comparator country, has the price of food fallen faster than in Finland.
The information comes from an article by Ilkka Lehtinen, head of development at the Statistics Centre, published in Tieto & Trendit.
The newspaper compared real prices, i.e. prices which are proportionate to the general trend in consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to 1994 levels.
It was a very alarming situation.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that EU membership brought", says Lehtinen.
Then came the turn, and food has become cheaper year after year.
The price is now being weighed by Russian food import bans that have halted food exports from Finland to Russia.
As a result, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term", says Lehtinen.
The price decline has also been affected by increased price competition in industry and trade.
The big retailers S-Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been shown in the form of glamorous advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a centre for affordable food, despite a substantial drop in food prices.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland among EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
According to the newspaper, the value added tax has a significant impact on the price of food sold in Finland.
He found that if the countries in question had the same rate of VAT, Finland would be the third cheapest food market in comparable countries.
The magazine compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the rate of VAT in the countries in question were seven, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell food cheaper than the Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in food prices, we need to halve VAT to the EU average and keep up price competition", Lehtinen writes.
The magazine notes that his calculations of the VAT rate are indicative.
School ain 't what it used to be .
A returnee to school may find that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools and will be introduced at the beginning of the term in all primary schools.
It is the guideline that all schools in Finland follow.
The schools will decide the details themselves, but the plan states the official objectives.
The new guidelines have been in the works for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
For example, the teaching of fine writing will be abandoned and coding will be taught in schools.
Swedish is taught from the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies from the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, is in the role of the students.
It used to be thought that the teacher taught the students, but now everyone must be active and learn from one another.
This is a way of trying to make school more interesting.
The world 's longest-living vertebrate has been found . A glacial shark can live up to 400 years .
The Greenland shark, also known as the ice shark (Somniosus microcephalus), does not reach sexual maturity until it is 150 years old.
After that, it can live another 250 years, reports a new study.
The numbers make it the longest-living species of vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is surpassed only by the Icelandic clam, whose oldest known specimen is 507 years old.
The Greenland shark swims across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, growing up to over five meters.
Because of the slow growth rate, only about a centimeter a year, the adults have lived a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon dating of the eyeglasses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 1,493- and 1,502-centimeter-long [493 and 1,502-cm] Amazonian catfish, turned out to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice-capped parrots do not reach sexual maturity until they are over four meters [4.5 inches] long, the researchers estimated that they are about 150 years old.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired almost 300 people. They're not cutting sales.
Nearly 300 employees are being laid off at Stockmann department store.
The cooperative societies in the company in difficulty were terminated at the beginning of August.
"The negotiations will result in the reduction of some 300 jobs, most of them in the form of redundancies", says Stockmann in a press release.
It states that the number of shopkeepers will not be reduced in order to avoid a loss of customer service.
In addition, some 80 support staff will be offered new sales jobs.
Stockmann's negotiations involved some 3 000 workers.
At the time of their introduction, the reduction was estimated at around 380 employees.
The reduction in population is intended to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are to be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme aimed at achieving savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The reason for this is Stockmann's difficulty in making a profit from the goods store.
Although the Group's adjusted operating profit improved to EUR 11,1 million in the second quarter, the goods business continues to be loss-making.
According to Stockmann's CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not reached the company's targets.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Norwegian authorities on the restructuring plan.
The improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the good performance of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best ever second quarter turnover and profit.
The operating profit of Lindex increased by EUR 9,5 million to EUR 28,1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group had a loss-making turnover of 4,1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover this year will be lower than last year.
Adjusted operating profit is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday will be the wettest day in the north with temperatures below 20 degrees throughout the country.
The center of low pressure over northern Finland predicts rainy weather on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
The central parts of the country will also experience rainy spells, but the south will experience a dry spell.
The temperature is no longer summery, with mercury below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In the northern rainy areas, it's gonna be 10 to 15 degrees.
The Kenyan national team is rocked by a doping scandal. Strange explanation for the kidnapping of their coach.
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah had tested positive for doping as a national team athlete.
The Associated Press reports that the athlete Anzrah was trying to perform for is 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan national team, said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotich in a surprise test.
The doping officials went to the Anzrah authorities to report him.
According to the report, Anzrah was sent home because he "committed a crime against the Kenyan national team".
He was pretending to be an athlete, giving a urine sample, even signing papers.
We cannot accept this kind of behavior", said Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee.
The Olympic athletics meet is on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known if the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth at last year's World Championships and is already the favorite to win in Rio.
Reuters reports that a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah was using an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the competition village.
When the anti-doping officials confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him for a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of being discovered", the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio 's athletic stadium is ruminating on its emptiness .
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to watch a sporting event.
The medal battle for the world's top athletes began in Rio on Friday, but they were able to show off their skills to a bewildering audience.
Rio organizers said Friday that only 58 percent of the morning tickets and 65 percent of the evening tickets have been sold.
The other was four years ago in London, where the stadium was buzzing with cheering crowds.
The final is sold out in Rio.
The spectatorism of the Rio Olympics has been noticed even before the sport of track and field.
For example, in rugby, water polo, and horse racing stadiums, thousands of empty benches have been seen.
When Brazil's medalists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball at the legendary Copacabana, the audience was only 70 percent full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played Russia, and the 12,000-seat stadium was only about 30 percent full.
The reason for the poor performance is at least that Brazil, which is struggling economically, is far from European and Asian competitors, and many Olympic sports are foreign to Brazilians who are used to soccer.
True, even the first game of the Brazilian national soccer team failed to fill the stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the organizers, said over the weekend that 82 percent of tickets had been sold, a significant decrease from four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell", Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from about nine euros to over a thousand euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets are under 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this is not yet allowed because the organizers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for lesser-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats in Rio Stadium this morning.
Even a beach volleyball on the sands of Copacaba has not caught the eye of the public.
The middleweight contestant competed in London 2012.
There were plenty of people at the leaflets.
A new way to protect nature - acquiring land rights
The Helsinki Foundation is contributing to nature conservation through new means.
The foundation, which was established last year, is acquiring ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, individuals, companies and entities can redeem land rights with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to pay for the right of ownership.
The owner of the land gets a veto over its 187-square-foot plot, which means that in practice, no approval is needed from every owner if the land is to be converted.
You can also get fairy rights for more than one block.
The acquisition of a right of administration is something tangible that can be passed on as a legacy or given as a gift.
No need to go out and carry banners or chain yourself up to protect nature", explains Juha Leviäkangas, who has acquired the management rights to his company.
The person who has obtained the right of administration receives precise location information from his block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
The Foundation's website provides a fascinating list of the names of the rights holders on the same map as the block data.
The only risk to the conservation project is that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is a non-profit foundation established to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation will act in some way that is unethical or commercial, but that should not be possible.
The Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is based on the idea of protecting natural areas so that they can be left intact and peaceful.
The foundation acquires land either by purchase or donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of rights of ownership, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims to expand beyond Finland and plans to import from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Trade Fair on 13-19 August.
Bicycle thieves are the worst scourge in the big cities.
Bicycle thieves are the worst scourge of Finland's big cities.
This year, more bicycles have been stolen there than in nine other major cities, for every person in the city.
The Helsinki Report found that the number of bicycle thefts reported to the police in the ten largest cities in Finland in January-August this year was as high as the number of bicycles and bicycle parts stolen per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti were placed at the top.
Police reports indicate that there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In contrast, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference.
"Other cities have twice the number of burglaries per capita", explains Tommi Reen, a police inspector with the Police Department.
Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bicycles have been stolen in Turku than anywhere else.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The prevalence of thefts can be affected by how much bicycle traffic there is in the city and how many bicycles there are", says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The number of bicycle thefts varies greatly depending on which cities are study and which are cycling cities.
The market is a tightly-closed place, with short distances and plenty of turns for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a very different kind of city, where the city centres are far apart and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport", says Reen.
The number of bicycle thefts reported by the police in Finland as a whole has slightly decreased in January-August compared with the same period last year.
Still, there's no reason to be too happy.
Despite the decline in recent years, just over 20,000 bicycle thefts are reported to the police each year.
That means 50 to 60 filling stations every day and about 4,000 bikes a year in Helsinki alone.
"They are large amounts", says Reen.
In reality, the thieves steal more bicycles, since only a fraction of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report bicycle theft, even though fewer than one in ten reported cases to the police are solved.
A typical solved bicycle theft is one where the police get word of the theft immediately and the thief is caught red-handed.
"Cases are also revealed in other investigations, such as when stolen bicycles are found in a drug case", says Reen.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught weekly on the spot or during a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
He says that bicycles are stolen from, for example, bike racks in shopping malls, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars - practically anywhere they are usually kept.
Of the individual models, the most frequently stolen are the Jopo, as in previous years.
A U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take the bicycle for short-term personal use, for example, but a large number of the stolen bicycles end up for sale, for example, online.
They're staying on the domestic market.
"At least the police have not been made aware that the stolen bicycles are rarely exported", says Reen.
The police say the buyers of the stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
I'm sure some of you buy a stolen bike without even knowing it.
Some of you may have doubts.
A buyer of a used bicycle must be careful, for he may be guilty of a concealment offence or violation.
"Alarm bells should ring if a good bike is sold at a significantly under-priced price", says Reen.
Special librarian Severi Hirvi carries his colorful Nopsa to the Kallion Library in Helsinki during his workday.
He has had five bikes, but none have been stolen, Hirvi says. "Never been taken, so far as a good monk goes".
"Maybe this is not so attractive to thieves, it may not even be hipster", reflects Hirvi from Helsinki.
At a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, a quick-witted Siiri Valve locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the bike is banging against the kiosk wall, but usually Valve locks the bike to something solid, like a wheel rack.
"It's a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own", says a student in Helsinki about his white bicycle, which cost about $500 for the body alone.
"I hear from my friends all the time that the wheels have been stolen".
"Especially bad wheels, like the Junk Job".
Valve himself had a bike stolen from a real estate company yard a year ago.
But the wheel hadn't been locked, so Valve was looking forward to stealing it.
Under 15s to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with US-based peer jury
In Helsinki, so-called peer jury trials are being conducted to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime.
The trial will initially be conducted on children under 15 years of age, who will now be free from criminal liability.
A jury of his peers will be brought to the scene of a first offense committed by a juvenile.
The idea is that a jury will discuss what happened with the offender and then decide on a penalty.
A week later, the offender can join a jury of his own to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
Tommi Laitio, the youth director, says the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"All of them guide the young person's activities in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake", Laitio explains.
The peer review system is modeled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first offense, a youth is not put in front of an adult panel but reflects on what happened with others of roughly the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at Palmu, who monitored the trial, says that the abuse was successfully dealt with.
Especially for those under 15 years of age, first offences may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to keep going on the path you've chosen", Lovio says.
The peer review body is part of the Helsinki project of the Immigrant Youth, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me-Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new ways of working are being offered to all those in need, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, which had obtained a draft of it for viewing.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signers want party funds diverted to the congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the dissent caused by Donald Trump, his carelessness, incompetence and record unpopularity, threaten to bring a swing to the Democrats in this election", the letter says, according to Politico.
Only directing all available resources immediately to the congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in a Trump-decorated anchor around their neck.
The letter says the decision shouldn't be difficult because Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are getting smaller by the day.
Politico says the letter is due to be sent out within the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is apparently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and is not about endorsing anyone.
The letter lists several acts by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have displayed dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials wrote an open letter saying they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States .
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released details of her economic policies on Thursday night.
I'm running for president so that the American economy will be good for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy will be good for him and his friends", Clinton said in her speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion, five-year program to improve America's infrastructure -- roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases from the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a hand-hold for the American workers who suffer as factories move to low-wage countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We are a builder nation. We must get back to building!
Clinton said it.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the situation for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway when he said the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax evader, it has to pay the exit tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
"I am opposed to any trade deal that works against workers or wages", Clinton promised.
According to speculation in The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program of Republican Donald Trump, announced on Monday, as "favoring only millionaires like this".
Trump's proposed screw-up of the corporate tax cut has been called a "Trump loophole" by Clinton.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded the audience of the small business owners whose bills Trump has not paid and the clothing that Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America", Clinton sneered.
The race has not kept Finns on the sidelines, but the mobile app is interesting
Sports teams usually appear in television ratings as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have not yet reached the amazing spectators.
The competition attracted a maximum of 12 per cent of the population: the swimming was watched by 615,000 viewers on the Olympic Channel in Yerevan on TV2 on Tuesday night.
For comparison, a month ago, the European Championships in athletics attracted almost 800 000 viewers at a time on TV2, while the European Championships in football attracted just over two million.
The most popular events so far have been Sunday night cycling and the opening day of the fifth day of track and field, both of which reached nearly half a million viewers on the Olympic Channel at a time.
The Commissioner for Sport, Panu Pokkinen, welcomed the results and said that the Olympic Games in Rio will be the first time that the audience will be divided into multiple venues.
In addition to television, the Finns are watching the Olympics from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased that a large proportion of television viewers are choosing the Olympics in general.
On the television side, viewers are divided between TV2 and Yle Fem.
The Rio Olympics are the first sporting event to be dedicated by Yle to an entire channel.
When you're on 24 hours a day, and you're watching from 20,000 to 500,000 people all the time, that's a good base.
Viewership is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's broadcasts are in Finland at night.
The second reason for the lack of interest - if anyone thinks it is - is probably the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal at the opening games, interest would have jumped up with it.
In addition, the sport of outdoor activities is just beginning, as are the other sports that Finns are interested in: sailing and horse riding.
The initial ratings have been close to what was expected, according to Pokkisen.
When the game starts, the ratings are gonna explode.
Yle launched Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for the Games, which rose to become the most downloaded free application in Finland in the first days of the Games on Apple's App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'm guessing we're about 200,000 loads in the air by now.
"We'll get the numbers later", says Pokkinen.
The Rio Arena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come in and the bugs have been fixed.
The Rio Arena has been subject to delays and other minor technical problems in the initial phase.
Updated versions of the applications have been received, which should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics will be seen on the YLE channels and in the arena more than any other sporting event ever before.
Yle Fem can follow some sports, and Yle Spehe broadcasts races daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most hardworking YLE ever, but also the last to be watched only on YLE channels.
From 2018, the Olympic Games will be shown on both YLE and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland's deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, with a depth of 95.3 metres at Kristinselää.
It could be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a 20-square-meter [20 sq m] pressure vessel at the bottom of the lake, which the dive computer showed to be 104 meters deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to confirm the observation by echo.
The method may not detect a small drop within a hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes include Inari Lake (92 m) and Suvasvesi (90 m).
The Saimaa, Toisvesi and Main Lake are over 80 metres high.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Vertigo.
The bottom of Lake Inari in particular has not been thoroughly mapped.
"There may well be unknown passages", Kannela muses.
If the deepest lake is defined by its average depth, it is the Great Juka Lake, 75 feet [23 m].
In this way, your Sun falls short of the top ten, and the Black Sea is even further from the top.
Correction of 12 August at 14:29: Corrected last paragraph where the deepest lakes were wrong.
IHN: Taxation of pensioners still more tight
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that the problem was brought to light during the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to that of salaried workers.
The board's motion does not include any such thing.
We think it should definitely be there.
The European Union is committed to a peaceful solution to the conflict in the Middle East.
Earlier this year, workers received a reduction in their earnings, which eased their tax burden.
The issue was heated up by opposition MPs who charged then-Financial Secretary Alexander Stubb (R-UK) with election promises.
Purchasing power is being secured, not increased.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure that the tax rate is maintained.
He says that tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
The Commission is also proposing that the EU should be given a mandate to implement the EU's nuclear programme.
He says that sticking to the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government.
It is a social contract and it must not be marred by question.
It is necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own belief in the future.
In the midst of prolonged unemployment
Ihalainen is calling on the government to tackle longterm unemployment in the budgetary gap, at least to stop its growth.
The number of longterm unemployed in June was about 17 000 higher than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will fall.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, a very large social decline is in the offing.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in attacks on Thailand
In Thailand, at least four people were killed in bombings last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists who are going to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions for caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
Westphalen said there were very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although it was difficult to estimate their exact numbers.
The Finnish travel season to Thailand is timed to the turn of the year.
Most of the tourists to Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in particular in Hua Hin to obtain information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be going well, says Westphalen.
No information on the perpetrator
Westphalen says we still don't know who did the attacks.
The Ambassador believes the events may be related to political unrest in Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was approved by referendum.
The referendum was not a transparent, democratic process.
Among other things, the country arrested people who declared their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population is raging, says Westphalen.
Muslims want more autonomy.
However, previous attacks have not been directed at tourist destinations.
Westphalen says there's a big local celebration in Bangkok today.
He says the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks affect the course of the day, so the authorities are very careful about security.
Thai police: attacks not international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from regular terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, reports the AP news agency.
At least four people have died in Thailand in the last 24 hours as 11 bombs exploded in various parts of the country, including the tourist-favorite cities of Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded overnight on the resort island of Phuket, a popular tourist destination for Finns, reports the Bangkok Post.
The information we have so far indicates that they did not require casualties.
Two of the bombs went off at Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, injuring one person, the newspaper said.
In the popular tourist destination of Hua Hin, a total of four bombs exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
Both twin bombings killed at least one person.
In addition, in southern Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in Surat Thanh village and in the city of Trang.
Both attacks killed at least one person.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many travelers, as it leads to the resort islands of Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan, and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown.
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, head of the military junta in Thailand, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We must not make people panic any more, he told reporters.
According to the Deputy Minister of Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators' intention was to destroy the country's tourism industry because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns who are going to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions for caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Injured Europeans
The attacks that took place during the Finnish night and the victims are still very little known.
We've had time to get a little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
The attack killed a local woman and injured more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The wounded include at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in Hua Hin's second attack.
Two bombs exploded near the famous clock tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have sealed off an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
The governor of Surat Thanh province said the bomb was hidden in a flower bed.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
We have at least one wounded.
The police chief interviewed by CNN said that the attack on Surat Than was also accompanied by two bombs that exploded about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs went off outside two different police stations.
Biles of the United States won the women's quadruple sculls.
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 points and Aliya Mustafina of Russia was third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for the Rio Olympics, where he will be the world champion in the pole vault, long jump and pole vault.
Biles has been a dominant force in women's gymnastics for the past few years.
He's got eight individual world titles from three seasons ago.
He's won the four-man and the four-man championships three times in a row and the pole position last year and the second year.
The U.S. team at Biles has won two World Team Championships.
You know, there's a lot more World Cup medals in Biles than jumping and bouncing.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: 'The iceberg has no effect on tourism'
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the bombings on tourism in Thailand.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think anything more remarkable will follow, says Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia for some twenty years.
A seasoned entrepreneur, he has seen up close many of the tragedies that have befallen Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then the bird flu, and last year, the bombing in Bangkok.
If these have not driven out tourists before, this one hardly.
The courthouse office is located a few hundred yards from the explosion.
The court heard about the attack from one of its own employees.
The employee called about 9:00 a.m. local time and said that it was a bad idea to come to the office.
The courthouse says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed due to the attacks early in the morning.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were put in place for the queen's birthday, says Huovila, referring to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere in Patong was calm, and shops on Main Street were allowed to open at about 10:00 a.m. local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
By 3:30 p.m., Thai time, traffic had returned to normal in Patong and most shops had opened.
Judging by the impact site, the explosion was quite small, says Huovila, who was at the scene.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
Patrol spotted two men matching IDs hiding in a nearby bush.
The other man was caught immediately.
The other escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of motor vehicle theft, theft and aggravated battery.
The police are grateful to those who gave us the tip.
The head of the investigation on the change of leadership in Russia: clear displacement
Russia's highest-level leadership change in years took place on Friday when President Vladimir Putin fired his administration's chief, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino, of Estonian origin.
He's an ex-diplomat who served as Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent the powerful people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that reversing leadership roles is one way to exercise power.
This is a way to prevent people from accumulating power for themselves independent of the president.
According to Kangasbro, it's also possible that Ivanov may have had a run-in with other senior officials or screwed up.
Reduction of rank to Ivanov
Mr Ivanov, a former Putin insider, will be moving to special duties in the environment and transportation departments.
In a video broadcast by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
Putin said Ivanov had asked to be transferred to other posts and suggested Vaino instead, Russia Today reported.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's perspective, this is a clear demotion.
Environment and transport are not very high on the Russian agenda.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has been a key member of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old cards, such as governors, have been changed in Russia recently.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi of the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the successor to Ivanov is that Putin is changing his inner circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields as they retreated into Syria.
They used civilians as human shields to flee to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars that took them to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90% of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS, last week.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected from earlier 7:30 PM news: We previously incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, but in fact ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
The Interior Ministry's document disclosure policy is illegal.
The Ministry of the Interior's policy of making documents public is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
The Votilainen told STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the authority's own guidelines, but on the law.
The Ministry of Interior has previously refused to hand over the list of participants of the Minister of Interior's events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified his decision on the basis of the instructions of the Cabinet Office and on the grounds that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's communications director tells STT that the Ministry has identified a need to reform its practices.
Usain Bolt 's final Olympic appearance begins in Rio .
As in years past, Bolt has been racing against time under the weight of the competition.
He injured his backside in his junior year and had to miss the Jamaican Olympic trials.
This hasn't been perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well and that's key", Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included strippers and fan-turned-reporters.
The porina around Bolt underscores the Jamaican's rise to stardom in an era when the sport has struggled with doping scandals and a declining interest in skating.
Bolt's last Olympic defeat came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the preliminary round of the 200 meters in a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promising youngster slowed by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began with the 100 meters, where he broke the world record and the confidence of the competitors despite finishing with a time of 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached his career high by measuring a clock.
The world records set in Berlin for the 9,58-meter and the 19,19-meter dashes are still in place.
In Rio, Bolt has announced his goal of breaking the 200-meter world record by 19 seconds, but no one believes it will happen except Bolt himself.
Bolt's toughest challenger in the 100 is 2004 Athens Olympic 100m champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt beat the American by just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt has not lost a final in his reign since he started in Beijing, if he's ever been on the road.
In Daegu, 2011 World Cup final of 100 km, Bolt was disqualified for cheating.
Bolt's gonna be 30 in a week.
He's an old man in the young men's game, and the Rio Olympics are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set his career's final goal for next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in a Sports Illustrated interview.
Rio revelations: two athletes suspected of doping
According to China's state news agency Xinhua, 18-year-old Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi tested positive for doping at the Rio Olympics.
A Chinese drug dealer named Chen Xiny was found to be doping with banned substances.
I also suspect that Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is involved in a doping offence.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic trainer was sent home for giving a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with evidence of the hormone epo.
She placed fourth in the women's 100-meter butterfly in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese national has taken his doping case to the International Court of Justice for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that a sample provided by Xinyi on Sunday would have found traces of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have been other doping cases in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female obstacle racer Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with evidence of the hormone EPO.
Kenya, on the other hand, has banned a Rio athletic trainer from his home for a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had posed as an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample in his name.
According to media reports, the suspect is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
Phelps will stop at nothing to bring historic gold to the show.
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, the American Michael Phelps, swam the 200-meter medley in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
Phelps also became the first swimmer to win Olympic gold in the same event for the fourth consecutive time.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in the mixed doubles, ahead of China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun. The BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview with the Evening Standard.
The story about Helen Skelton (ed.) on Monday is the most read story on the website of the Evening Standard this week.
And next to her is the news anchor Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't get too stressed if there's a little buzz in the press or the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
He says television is a visual medium.
Skelton is wearing high heels and a short dress, which I'm sure will at least have enough exposure for many conservative British viewers.
However, there is no prospect of any backtracking.
It's important to look good, and little boobs are just fun.
I'm sure Skelton wants to calm down and maybe even shock, but he insists he doesn't want to be the lead.
He says it's not about me.
We're watching sports here, and we need to focus on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine the height of the swelling?
I can't, but anything that draws attention to how hard these swimmers work and how great sacrifices they make is fine with me, Skelton grins.
You know what, man?
It's a fuss over nothing if it comes to the dress code.
I'm a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police made two arrests on suspicion of terrorism.
Rio police announced Thursday that they have arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
Police made the arrests as part of a security detail for the games.
The police made five other arrests in the same context and interrogated two persons before their release.
All the suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news website, the terrorism arrests are from the same group that police arrested in July.
The suspects are believed to have ties to the Islamic State terrorist organization.
The arrested were known to have incited violence on social media.
The violence was spread through popular WhatsApp, among other sites.
There are 85,000 police officers in charge of security at the Rio Olympics.
Police detonated a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their opening game of the Rio Basketball Tournament in an empty arena on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball court and closed the venue to the public.
Police let the crowd in after they controlled the detonation of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled explosion.
Police have closed the arena after a suspicious package was found in the area.
The crowd was allowed in after the police had controlled the detonation of the package.
The crowd did not arrive for the game because police closed the arena after a suspicious package was found in the stadium.
The police detonated the package and then let the audience into the auditorium.
A drink woke up the Spanish team, who had started the race in a sleepy way.
Spain, which had started the tournament with two losses, beat Nigeria 96-87.
In the last two games, Spain won silver.
This is the third time police have carried out a controlled explosion during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police had to detonate a suspicious find near a road bike end was last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria opened their opening game of the Rio Basketball Tournament to empty spectators.
Argentine lady knocks out the Traitor Siren , Finnish woman thinks about protesting
Wind Traitor Siren had a colorful day of competition in Rio.
The Wind Traitor Sir was having a rough Thursday.
The Argentine lady wore the Wind Traitor Siren on Thursday at the opening ceremony of the Women's Surfing Day in Rio.
Clearly, the wind was broken.
The opponent admitted to the violation.
He was trapped in a car accident and the others fled, Finland's head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete thought long and hard about protesting.
Well, it wasn't worth doing, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
"I should have fallen into the water to get my reparation", said the Traitor Siren.
The Finn hung on his board until the end because he didn't want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
The Finn was 27th in the race after the accident.
Overall, the 2012 London Olympics silver medalist is eighth.
The head, it's not like the crash had any effect.
Friday's the big day. We're running the 10th and 12th.
Modified 0.39: Contrary to initial reports, Traitor Siren did not protest.
7 Unusual Things That Science Says Can Extend Your Life
Science has explored everything that exists between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to add years to a person's life.
Some of these are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person's health and prolong his life.
At other times, things beyond one's control can add years to one's life.
These include a tendency to be overweight or have a social status.
Regular shopping can prolong life.
You don't have to go to the bathroom every time. Just go to the bathroom and get a can of milk.
The secret of longevity has been explored in many studies.
Medical Daily has seven of the strangest studies ever.
Science says all these things can add years to your life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with "a reduced risk of death", especially in the case of neurological or heart disease.
Again, in favor of alcohol, studies show that moderate use - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one researcher found that wine drinkers lived longer than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life by up to six years, reports one study.
The claim is based on the claim that it prevents genital infections.
In turn, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found that laughter can also affect a person's life span.
The seven-year project followed more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to survive the experiment than those who laughed less.
Sex, when taken with the protection against STDs, is shown by many studies to be beneficial to health.
And besides, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, just having sex as it is is not enough.
In order to add years to one's life, one must also have an orgasm.
Well, I'm sure being physically active will add years to your life.
However, longevity does not require absolute sobriety.
A study at Oxford University found that women with large buttocks had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to low sheep mortality.
Whether an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he is more likely to live longer than the average bully.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some researchers suspect that longevity is a function of a person's social status - which in turn makes it possible to seek awards such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behavior among people over 65 years of age found that a person who shops daily was less likely to live as a parent who shops less.
This is because walking around a physical store reduces loneliness.
In turn, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may cause premature death.
So, count your credit card out of your hand, so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
A drunk driver hit a truck with a drunk driver's license.
On Friday evening, a serious collision between a truck and a car occurred in Koske, Finland.
The accident happened on Kosk, between Koskenti and Sorvastonti on Friday at 9pm.
The truck had been heading towards Forssa when the passenger car that had been met had entered the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left on its lane after the crash, but then caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The car went into the ditch and then over the ditch to the roof.
A woman, born in 1972, was driving a passenger car. She was trapped in her car.
The rescue service removed the injured driver from the car and took him to the University of Turku Central Hospital for treatment.
The woman's breath test came back 2.02 percent.
He's a suspect in a DUI.
The post office sent the wrong candy to the wrong town .
The K-Citymarket's candy range was deficient because the post office had accidentally delivered part of the cargo to Seinäjo.
Teija Haltia, a resident of Pernió, was buying candy at the Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when he noticed a funny sign.
Unfortunately, there are product defects in the loose-leaf ones because the Post Office delivered our shipment to Wall River!
We'll get more when the Post Office gets the shipment delivered!
So unless there's a lot of traffic on the lawn, the sign said,
The sign of the merchant's fuss is related to the fact that the Post Office expanded its services last spring to include mowing the lawn.
The Post will be offering the lawn mower until the end of August.
The elf thought the sign was mostly funny, so he decided to share it on social media.
I was just blown away by the popularity of the update.
The media has been calling all the time, and the attention this has generated is incredible, Halti wonders.
By Friday night, Haltia's update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
The elf got his favorite to get caught in a bag of loose candy, even though a few fields were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, head of the Postal Service's transport business, apologized to the company.
The reason is that three of the five stages got lost yesterday in the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to do a part-time production (Salo) with three, but only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
The Evening News was the first to report on the matter.
The Elf didn't get mad at the sign because he found all his own loose candy bars in the assortment.

He's a total lifestyle change and lost a little bit of weight quietly by thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a photo of his stunning performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund's before and after photo pair has garnered several rave reviews from national scouts.
You are gorgeous.
We're on the same road, motivation's high, someone's glowing.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's do it now project.
I get so much energy and enthusiasm from your pictures, when I'm on the same journey, another says.
This spring, Lotta lost her last few pounds as part of the Let's Do It Now project.
At that time, he told the Evening Standard that he wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which was then a distance of ten kilograms.
During the three months of physical therapy, I finally lost five pounds.
The family of a woman murdered in Loviisa wishes the memory of her victim to be donated to police dogs .
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa a week ago hopes that instead of flowers and addresses, the victim will be remembered by a donation to police dog work.
The Sipoon Veterinary Station has posted a Facebook update to share the victim's family's wish for donations to police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Station and had also completed her nursing training there.
The vet station will remember her with touching words.
Cheerful, smart, with a sense of humor and no fear of work.
Good fellow.
We still can't quite comprehend that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number for donations.
The update states that the donation money will go entirely to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own backyard in Loviisa Koskenkyla.
The woman's neighbors have told the Evening Standard that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a rooster.
The 27-year-old suspect in the murder did not know the woman and they had no connection.
The police dog Börje was also involved in the pursuit of the killer, who was fatally wounded during the arrest.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of Appeal ruled that the Post had violated the Equality Act.
The Court of Appeal held that the Post Office had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to inform the employee of the contract.
The Court of Appeal ordered Post to pay the employee the bulk of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 in compensation for the discrimination.
The judgment stated that Posti could only deduct from the salary of the surveyor a part corresponding to the part of the survey carried out during the whole day's work.
The Court of Appeal held that the employee had been placed at a disadvantage by reason of her trade union activity, contrary to the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the PAU's decision on the prohibition of consultation.
During the postal strike last November, the PAU made a decision that postal workers would not be consulted on strike-breaking hired workers.
It was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey must return to respect for human rights
The European Parliament also called on the Commission to ensure that the EU's nuclear programme is implemented in a manner that is consistent with the EU's nuclear programme.
The report also calls on the Commission to take a more active role in the implementation of the EU's external action plan.
The European Union has also been a major contributor to the fight against corruption and organised crime.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
Putin has replaced the head of his administration with a man of Estonian origin .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
He is succeeded by Anton Vaino, grandson of the Soviet-East Estonia Communist leader Karl Vaino.
He is a former member of the 'Russian People's Republic' and a former member of the 'Russian People's Republic'.
He will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Mr Ivanov, a close associate of Mr Putin, will be transferred to special posts in the environment and transport sectors, the Kremlin said in a statement.
Putin said Ivanov had asked to be transferred to other posts and suggested Vaino instead, Russia Today reports.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to his post in 2011 before Putin was re-elected President in 2012.
ManU's giant ban ban won't be seen in the opening game of the Champions League.
The world record holder in football transfers will not be seen on the pitch as the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban from England was a consequence.
Manchester United giant Paul Pogba is out of action due to a suspension as ManU opens their league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid Pogba to Juventus, according to British media, 105 million euros.
However, the FA has kept Pogba out of the game, as Juventus have imposed a ban on Pogba.
He got two warnings last season in the Coppa Italia, and that's a one-game ban.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next game is in the second round of the league on August 19th, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of greatness is a virtue.
The strict criteria of entertainment and ambitious visions have established Flow Festival as an internationally respected event featuring the world's top artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
The partygoers have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival's event area is decorated with artificial turrets and art installations.
"We never had enough of just the main stage and the beer tent", says the event's artistic director, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, which is being held this weekend in Helsinki's Suvilahti, has grown from a small block party to an event with tens of thousands of visitors.
The key to success is a simple question: What kind of event would the people who make it want to go to?
It's a little weird in the news media to think that way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says the event's artistic director, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors by 5,000 from last year's 70,000.
This year, the festival will also see a number of interesting local and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something has to be financed.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being guided along vast trails.
We don't want that.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been inflated to include 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurants and bars in the area, which is partly covered with a fake tower.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, this year's concert will be held in a tent with 15,000 people.
The Rock admits that the event could be performed more simply.
Maybe I'm a little megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've managed to keep the spirit of Flow alive.
If you lose it, this is no longer our case.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done on the rock is that even grand visions are now practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, the activities were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of around EUR 20 000.
Last year, the limited company operating Flow had a turnover of around EUR 6 million.
It can be used to accomplish "circular things", such as building that 250-foot-wide [73 m] tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in distinctive clothing.
In addition to the music event, there is a trendy community of young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to be different, above all, in content.
Yet, even fashion events fit into Flow's values of curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the featured artists is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his genre, but he's not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indie rock, pop, rap and soul.
Kallio says Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time he'll be seen on a show in Finland.
We're interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's on commercial radio.
I mean, I'm sure I'm not the only one who's been thinking about it.
The bombs were hidden in flower pots in a tourist paradise in Thailand .
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 others were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a vase and detonated by cell phones.
The bombs were planted on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
The blasts occurred as tourists began leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife conservationist who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a picture of the attacks that speaks volumes.
If the tweet doesn't show up properly, you can check it out here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said a bomb went off outside the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, local time, two bombs exploded in Surat Thanh.
At least one of them died.
The number of casualties is still unknown.
Very soon afterward, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, a favorite of Finns.
No one was killed, as far as we know.
Meanwhile, another double bombing was launched in Hua Hin.
At least one dead and three wounded.
And there was a bomb in the city of Trang.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet detonated.
Thai authorities say the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel groups who are unhappy with the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities have estimated that there may be criminal organizations involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken a hard line on criminal organizations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the newly formed reserve forces goes into combat first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, soldiers are ordered to combat duties only several months after taking the oath of allegiance, says Central Finnish.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonnen, the head of training for the Armed Forces, who was interviewed by the magazine, only those who are in the final stages of their training are combat-ready.
The training director said that the first to be assigned to the service are reservists from the reserve forces.
No soldier or reservist is ordered to a task for which he has not received the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier this summer, it emerged that the Armed Forces will begin training soldiers in the immediate-readiness units starting next year.
Units may be used in combat operations as early as during reserve training if necessary.
Pamela Tola got a huge settlement from the homestead .
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a bitter dispute over an apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The sale price of the two-storey detached house was EUR 330 000.
However, after the transaction, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, causing a health-threatening microbial growth.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014 for scrap.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, resulting in an economic loss for Tola and Waroma of EUR 198 000.
The couple took the matter to court, demanding a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district and appellate courts.
The court of appeals ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a reduction of EUR 150 000.
The seller is also ordered to pay the couple's legal and administrative costs, totalling EUR 47 344.
The court justified the price reduction somewhat because some of the homes had been known to the buyers when the sale was made.
However, the Court of Appeal held that the construction errors which had been detected were substantially more serious than had been alleged.
Tola was looking for a good home .
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a good home because they did not want to undertake the renovation.
He had come to believe that the building was well repaired and in good condition and that there was nothing wrong with the features mentioned in the inspection report.
The municipal inspection report mentioned as risks and inconveniences ventilation and the inadequate management of rain and meltwater flowing along the cliff face.
However, the discussions did not reveal any urgency.
Tola and Waroma felt that rainwater from the rock might need to be diverted somewhat in a few years.
The transactions were concluded in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became clear that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than had been thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growths in the building, which the Witnesses said were caused by both the rock's rainwater and capillary moisture.
On the west side of the house, the inspector estimated that air contaminated by germs could also enter the interior through the porch.
The samples of soot or yeast, which may pose a health risk and exceed the limit values, were found in the household room, the cellar staircase, the living room window sill and the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without a permit.
The court also discussed whether the apartment had been enlarged in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that the apartment had been altered in violation of the permit before the sale.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although the proper permits had not yet been obtained.
However, the home issues were a central issue in the court case.
The Court of Appeal held that the buyers could assume, on the basis of information obtained from the seller before the sale, that the building was suitable for housing as it was and that no major renovations were needed in the immediate future.
The Court of Appeal considered that there was no particular reason for Tola and Waroma to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
The Court of Appeal held that the purchasers had not failed to fulfil their obligations under the contract.
A shocking discovery in the archives: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for the Nazis - including Finns in the register
In a recent article in Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson reports that the National Archives in Maryland, U.S.A., has microfilmed documents on a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi bridesmaids.
The documents and registration cards are from the race bureau in Nazi Germany.
The Race Bureau operated under the direction of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true in even greater numbers of women who were expected to be able to bear up to 10 or more children.
According to Andersson, the women were given gynecological examinations to determine the cause.
The race bureau investigated the women's background, including by examining church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be willing to renounce their Swedish citizenship and to give the Swedish Race Bureau handwritten biographies and good recommendations from relatives.
The race bureau wanted assurances that the women were "child-lovers", "savvy", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The case does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either out of wedlock or in marriage.
The Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not promoted very actively, says the United States Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for having children.
The German Mother's Cross of Honour was awarded to women who had borne at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryan" and "non-Aryan" were forbidden by law, says the museum's website.
Traitor-Sir, in the sixth, the Squirrel rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first race of the Finnjollie Day sailing event at the Rio Olympics, but was left behind in the second race.
Nirkko moved up to eighth overall after five starts, but a second-lap failure dropped him to 14th.
Wind Traitor-Siren fought in the RS:X class on the day of the start 17th and third.
Overall, Traitor Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd at the opening day break.
Overall, the Lindgren's are 19th.
Jari Bridgeland Satulinna was recorded during a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so upset"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland's favourite artists for over 20 years.
From a cruise ship bartender to the tango king of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää is still able to cheer and is currently on a furious rise.
The book written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of the favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - Nakjaana, was published today, Thursday.
In his book, Bridgehead, he tells of his life and career, for better or worse.
His career took off when he won the King of Tango crown at the Seinäjoen Tango Market in 1995.
In the race, Bridgehead sang tango, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The song "Satulinna" became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording did not go exactly as planned: Bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so upset!
The bridgehead is in the book.
You wouldn't know it from a recording of a huge hit song that it was sung in a hangover.
I wasn't at my best physically, but the trail was good.
I learned that you don't have to expect perfection and excellence all the time.
The second incident involving his favorite songs, described in the book, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää separated from her then-partner and the affair eventually ended with lyrics to the song "You Deserve Gold", which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the lyrics Saara ordered from Törmässö were not what Bridgehead would have wanted.
The bridge had imagined that it was a record that told the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the breakup were not true, but were based on a story in the newspaper 7 Days.
A newspaper article in the newspaper said that Jari's ex-girlfriend broke up with him because of his excessive partying and alcohol use, but Jari said that was nonsense and not true.
According to the book, Jari called the record company in a rage and refused to sing the song, but ended up singing it anyway - and good for her.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting to leave the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters voted to leave and 48% would have stayed in the EU, despite the contrary opinion polls of the week.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in favour of remaining in the EU.
No respected research institution or university flagged a dissent, even though a few individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the slogan of the recent election campaign of former US President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid", was dropped in the trash in the UK Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn't seem to be the most important thing in politics.
The economic curve
The Centre for Macroeconomics is asking the trade community for answers to the Brexit disaster in its latest monthly survey.
The most common answer is that economists were not heard, because this time the voters decided on non-economic criteria.
One of the explanations economists give for the loss of economic status is that people don't understand economics.
Many people still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, that is, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the realm of the British.
Many also feel that a decline in the value of the currency would be a good thing, since it would promote export industries.
The Committee of the Regions believes that the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly irritated by the BBC's bias, which gave as much room to pro-EU economists representing only a few per cent of the economic community as to the overwhelming majority.
The anti-EU press was not interested in telling what the IFS, the IMF, the BoE, the CEPR and the LSE and other economic powerhouses thought of the consequences of the divorce.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both heard and understood, they were ignored because the economists represent an elite with whom the voters themselves do not feel they have a common interest.
While academics in big cities like economists would have stayed in the EU, the message was not effective in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is an economy too.
The overwhelming argument for the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant overcrowds your hospital, an immigrant uses you.
These arguments worked.
Every coffee shop has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would there be for the British if they left?
Every health center in the world has a waiting room full of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for a Britishman to get medical appointments if there were no doctors?
Every school in the country has immigrant kids.
How much easier would it be for a real British child to get into school if they were to be put out of business?
Every municipality has foreigners.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
But economists have not been able to answer them, and even if they have, their answers have not gained traction.
Economists have failed to explain that immigrants have given the British more jobs, fewer lines in health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK budget and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepared for Brexit with cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish investment manager Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that in Aberdeen, preparations for Brexit were made in good time by drawing up plans A and B.
The preparations for the victory of Plan B, the pro-Brexit camp, began in more detail a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a 'leave'.
There was a concern that investors would start pulling their money out of the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but they may be needed now.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only daily open-ended listed real estate fund that the news touched on.
The old man said the normal level would be 15 to 20 percent.
The value of the fund at that time was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest of the nine open-ended real estate funds, says Vanhanen, of all the open-ended real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest cash in these funds remained at 10 percent or even below.
So the real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed the trading.
When the pro-Brexit camp won, Europe went crazy.
The real estate market was relatively calm in the two weeks following the vote, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, in which he assessed that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial real estate.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they plundered the situation and made headlines in the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared with 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to roll and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position because of the cash raised, but it too eventually had to freeze its trading for six days.
The old man said they didn't actually close the deal. They changed the price down.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worthwhile to withdraw the money in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to withdraw your money now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed things down, and most of them called off the report.
Since then, the market has been fairly stable, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar surge in Aberdeen's Continental Europe funds.
But there were a lot of questions.
Unfairly focused on real estate funds
The old man thought the closing of the real estate fund's trades got unduly attention.
The open-ended funds affected by the closures control around 4% of UK property.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold off less than 10 of its 80 properties in London.
Some of the other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned investors this week that it may hold its fund closed for part of 2017.
The current climate of uncertainty and the downward trend in economic growth forecasts do not seem to be getting any 'worse' for Aberdeen.
The major questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen notes.
The pound and the dollar are at their lowest in 30 years, and the market is selling 15% lower than it was before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
Old Man says there's a lot of buyers willing to buy.
Brexit has brought down London's housing market.
At 2:00 a.m., the situation still didn't look too bad.
But at 4am, when Pertti Vanhanen, head of real estate investment at Aberdeen Asset Management, a British real estate fund, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's a powerful word, your head.
I realised that this was going to be part of plan B, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
The City of London was already alive and well, despite the dawn.
The television screens in the office, normally silent, played the news, and the usually noisy crowd fell silent to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera to announce his departure this morning.
When the market opened, the ends of the stage flashed red.
It was the kind of morning Vanhanen never thought he'd live to see, says Vanhanen.
Not that, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest property funds, completed two real estate deals the day after the Brexit vote.
It was a mixed bag.
However, the company had prepared well for the alternative, and therefore the situation was somewhat calm, Vanhanen says.
The Brexit vote started a movement to fix it.
The vote was followed by a storm.
Punta collapsed, the British leadership changed.
The market was beginning to anticipate sharp declines in the UK and particularly in London's housing market.
London office space was forecast to decline by up to 20 percent in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trades one after another.
Aberdeen did the same for six days.
Now the poison has subsided, but the air is still uncertain.
It is not, however, reflected in the face of Old Man, who spent his last days of summer vacation in Helsinki this week.
He said it was too early to say much about the consequences of Brexit.
So much remains to be seen: how the separation will take place and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
Initial information on the development of the London property market has already been received.
The price developments data from CBRE, a real estate services company, cover around a third of the market.
They found that prices for all London properties fell by 3.3 percent between June and July.
In the City of London, the decline was 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index was started in 1987, and only five months have seen worse numbers, says Vanhanen.
All the declines were of equal magnitude in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared very quickly to the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began in the US housing market.
The elderly man feels that the comparison is not entirely fitting, since this is a domestic crisis in Britain.
I don't feel the same way.
The real estate market is not experiencing the panic sales of that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
I mean, you can always find the funding.
The repair shop could have been ahead anyway .
In fact, he is not surprised that the price fixing movement could have been on the horizon even without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that property prices in London and other major cities around the world have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years now that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the drop started from really high.
London prices have soared for four reasons, Old Man's List.
The British economy has grown strongly, and so has the population of London.
The second big trend is that real estate is the last asset class to be globalized, says Vanhanen.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutional and private investors are looking for foreign real estate investment.
London is known as a city of easy target.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies to seek returns from new sites, for example.
In addition, credit has been readily available - although according to Vanhassen, the leverage ratio is now significantly lower than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
- I'm going to break it up.
In London, the price rise leveled off last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also started to reduce his holdings in London, and he was a net seller last year.
I was expecting some kind of turn, and now it's here.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He's not afraid to predict the future, but he says there's little hope of any upward movement.
The mood suggests a downward or steady trend.
Old man has seen a lot of ups and downs since he's been in real estate since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the only way out of the hole is to work.
If you're prepared to take risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you've diversified, you've diversified the risks, says Vanhanen.
Group S is starting to record more accurately than before
The S Group knows what you're eating because the retail group announced today that it's starting to collect more accurate data on the purchases of its regular customers.
Once the final amount of the receipt has been collected, the team will start to collect it from the products purchased in early May.
Group S follows Kesko in this respect, as the data on goods purchased with the plus card have been collected in the Kesko customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes subject to authorisation.
The most effective channel is email.
"It is a very rare customer who has refused to use product information", Riitala told Taloussanom.
He said Kesko has no intention of reacting to the change in registration of Group S.
Kesko classifies its regular customers into ten groups based on their food purchases alone.
The classification shall be updated on a monthly basis.
The main customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount spent on them.
The data will be used for customer-driven marketing.
Product-specific purchasing data are collected only from the K-group's own chains.
The partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a fixed client programme and there are no plans for this round.
Finland's local market has its own first-class bonus customer base, which can be joined at the local markets, Siwo and Euromarket.
We are not currently collecting information at product or product group level, we are staying at the receipt total level.
So we know where the purchases were made and when and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not reached the level of the K-group or the S-group, says Anu Ora, commercial manager.
He said the main customer programme was to be renewed in the future, but that the local shop would tell us more about it later.
However, Ora does not promise to start registering product information.
First , an experiment .
SOK's customer and owner register has been relatively extensive up to now.
The basic data included personal and address data, as well as occupation, education, residence and the children's birth years and previous personal data.
The persons belonging to the same household and their role are also registered.
The S-card store records the date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of the purchase and the method of payment.
In addition, the information on S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash registers.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchasing data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, for S-markets, Prisma, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, data are recorded at product group level for the time being.
Customers have long hoped that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK's Head of Owner and Partner Operations.
S Group says they'll notify their customers of the change.
They may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
But the data is going to be stored in the cash registers anyway, whether you want it or not.
The applicant can check the data stored on the S-Group website.
For example, the cash registers do not have access to the data, Saarikoski stresses.
Video: Heila the puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
A black Labrador retriever's cub sniffs vigorously at five similar boxes lined up at Helsinki Airport.
It doesn't take long for it to sit firmly beside the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila for playing with his favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, a can of gunpowder-scented shells was revealed.
The first smell that Heila has now been trained on is gunpowder, says Suntio, the owner of Heila's dog.
The main reasons for the security situation and online commerce
Heila is the first specialised gun and explosives dog at the customs and will be posted to Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Sunti to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will remain Heila's main employment location as the international security situation has changed following the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
Another main reason for training the weapons and explosives dog for customs duties is the postal consignments passing through Helsinki Airport.
With the growth of Internet commerce, the airport handles up to 40 million mail items a year, some of which may include weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, the customs authorities have made a discovery at Helsinki Airport of approximately 300 items of online shopping, passenger luggage and air cargo, including weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, and their starting materials.
Heila will be working in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It's gonna be looking into checked baggage and mail.
It will be of great benefit in the future in the port, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Churchnum
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tull Dog School in Kirkkonum.
Suntio also goes to train with Heila with police and Defense Forces experts.
The police have a strong background in dog training and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, will decide what smells Heila is trained to recognize.
Grönberg says that Heila is always given further training as needed.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are the customs' six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Lady Heila has been chosen from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog for the airport include its agility and hunting instincts, as well as its calmness in dealing with weapons, explosives and human traffic.
Heila, who lives at Sunti's home, is a close coworker of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heil from the box.
The cameraman of the Evening News loses the camera's mic cover for the fast dog, but Heila restores the cover, which looks like a soft toy, at the command "go".
Tough competition for working dogs
Heila's graduating from elementary school next year.
There are still proficiency tests to be held in October to assess whether the training is sufficient for the demanding job.
Heila can be seen on duty at Helsinki Airport in the second half of next year, if all goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and pet a dog with a work vest on, Suntio reminds.
The cost to the customs authorities of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
They work for about seven or eight years, even ten, and then they retire to their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active shifts last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There's a lot of competition in Customs for working dogs.
Heila's got about 20 to 30 customs workers applying to be his owner.
The lucky man was Suntia, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience with dogs and supervisory duties at Customs.
The mini-state won its first Olympic medal. The people get a day off.
The country of Fiji, with a population of less than one million, holds such high regard for its Olympic gold medalist in rugby that the government has declared August 22 a national holiday.
According to the national broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the matter after the championship was decided.
The day off is the day after the team gets home.
The hero team will also have a party in their home country.
The Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The final was watched in the capital, Suva, with a screen installed in the stadium, reports The Guardian.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them cheering", said Fiji Times columnist Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Drama in Riga: Finnish weightlifter passed out after a brutal performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt after a hard fight at 175 kilos.
The hook has a special and life-threatening property for lifting.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has passed out many times.
No one's really been able to tell me why.
In Rio, Tokola weighed 175 pounds for pushing and 145 pounds for snatching.
His joint was 320 kilos.
The warehouse tried to get his job with the last one, 175 kilos, as well as the other one.
On the third attempt, the weights rose with a violent scream.
His body trembled under the weight of the weight until the jury agreed to lift him.
The Finnish lifter's joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS has acquired Estonian striker Prosa .
The Rovaniemi Football Club, which plays in the Men's Football League, has signed an extension to the end of the season with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We're looking for a top player in our team with potential and a small chance of getting to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We've worked with over a dozen player agents to go through over 50 players from all over the world.
Gradually, Prosa started to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a press release.
Prosa, 25, joins RoPS from Flora in Tallinn, where he scored 51 goals in 109 appearances.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosan is scheduled to be with RoPS on Saturday at Seinäjoen, where the Rovaniemi will face the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's country king, Alexander Kokko, moved to Australia.
The great Modern Family star is showing off again: teenage shorts reveal almost everything.
Ariel Winter, known as the nice Alex Dunphy of the sitcom Modern Family, is once again showing off her formidable body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in miniature shorts that leave little room for the imagination.
The shorts not only revealed the actor's legs, but also his butt.
Winter, 18, has recently attracted attention by making a dramatic change in her style and behavior.
The star has appeared in her photos posted on social media in very little clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
The young woman has also been seen wearing very scanty clothes.
Winter, now approaching adulthood, has also recently posted several photos of herself celebrating.
If you can't see the picture, you can watch it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from child star to adult.
She's been on television most of her life and she grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you see of a bare surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started on Modern Family when she was only 11.
The actor has angered some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It is not hard to see where he will be in ten years' time, when the downpour is already so severe", says a woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of her fans, however, defend the actress and urge her to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what anyone says.
You're an inspiration to many women, a shining young woman.
Japanese people prefer the Nordic countries to Finland , attracting tourists with a spotlight , where in autumn it is possible to see the fairy-tale mirror aurora .
The campaign is designed to encourage Japanese people to start lighthouses in early autumn, says a Visit Finland press release.
The main tourist destinations of the Japanese are Inari and Levi.
The reign cards of our winter tour are the reign cards, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and the snowy landscape.
The demand for winter light tours in Lapland is very high, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn tours.
Few people know that the spring season begins in early autumn and continues well into spring.
In autumn, the mirror aurora can be seen, with the lake surface reflecting the rays of the sun, making the sight twice as fabulous, says Anne Lind, vice president of marketing at Visit Finland.
Visit Finland's spotlight campaign is aimed at wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 who live in cities and dream of travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland through online advertising, among other things.
A survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo shows that Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image of the country among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more clear and unique sights of Finland, and this lighthouse has huge potential, according to Lind.
The number of overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland has increased significantly more than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as much time in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
Japanese tourists are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
The average Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain settles for rugby silver as the FID championship course leads to gold
Great Britain's impressive run in the rugby tournament collapsed in Fiji's final challenge in Thursday night's final, when the team suffered a crushing 43-7 defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji set a course record in tackles, chewing, dodging, tackles, line and power, winning gold in their first Olympic medal.
The loss brought a reasonable consolation for the silver medal - Britain's third of the day - and they were able to take pride in their hard work in the opening tournament of the Olympic rugby tournament, where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A hard 7-5 semifinal defeat of South Africa earlier in the day could have plagued them in the final.
But even so, in his condition, Fidi would have beaten a top-notch team of 15 people.
The United Kingdom may - but probably not - take comfort in the fact that at least one Briton will be wearing a gold medal tomorrow: the head coach of FID is Ben Ryan, former England boss at Wimbledon.
It's been quite a trip to Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Tournament.
They only lost one here.
This backlash is painful, but the progress is staggering.
Fidi got off to a brilliant start by rejecting British ploys for fun.
For captain Tom Mitchell and his team, it was like running into moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the end zone in the corner.
With four minutes left on the clock, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown from right field led to a field goal.
12-0 and the British had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped man-mount Leone Nakarawa from scoring his third goal, but it was just a slowdown for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu scored in the right corner, and Great Britain were down 17 to 0.
Nakarawa scored again from the start, and the clock was still more than a minute... of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then rushed through the UK's loose tackles and ran to the line to score.
After the goal, it was 29-0 at halftime.
It looked as if Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain was just learning the game.
And that's exactly what it is.
Great Britain made a few changes at half-time that blocked Fidi's lead for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored after Fidi's impressive pass.
Dan Norton scored for Great Britain with a touchdown in the left corner, narrowing the score to 36-7, but the game was long lost to the South Sea Islanders, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fide's cheerful approach.
Mat Viliame's last-minute goal was a crust on Fidi's cake that didn't need crust.
The whistle was blown, the Fidalis embraced, and Britain fell to the ground, completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fidi had beaten Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, and Great Britain beat South Africa in a close semi-final, with both scoring a goal - a British goal to decide the game.
Kyle Brown took the lead for South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with a stunning footwork and scored under the goal posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of England's 15-a-side rugby team, secured the victory and ultimately the silver medal.
Coach's battle with cancer led to the victory of Helen Glover and Heather Stanning in the relay.
There will be no more emotional gold in these games, and that certainly means something.
From first bet to last, 220 hard-hitting runs into the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estação da Lagoa.
Although they rowed alone, there were three voices on the boat, and the echo of coach Robin Williams was present the entire time as the pair battled for their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pair competition, the first women in British sports history to achieve such a feat.
Their reign was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance undefeated, which is also a record.
What we see here, two great athletes joining in a swan-like silence on the surface, does not quite capture the character of victory.
Behind each of these golden gloves is a group of helpful hands that are progressively promoting the things that matter, and no pair of hands was as essential as the coach who, when diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago, didn't know if he would live to see this day.
Like he said, it was a tight situation.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be removed, and they did the surgery.
If they don't cut it, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes the way you think a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The three were fortunate that his treatment was able to begin in early 2014 in the off-season, when they caused the least possible disruption - if that's the term you can ever use in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital, walking around the ward 20, 30, 50 feet at a time, when they said a few steps would do.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bit bigger.
Immediately after the win, the first thing the couple thought of was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had been talking a little bit more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Regiment of Artillery who has been in Afghanistan, said: 'I've been having a nightmare this week, which may be a bit overreactive, but it means so much to me.'
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard Helen and I, and Robin, too, have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been amazing.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so he deserves a lot of credit. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a contest in five years.
The pair set a hard beat that their rivals couldn't match.
Even in the final 500 metres, as the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in store.
We were very close in an instant.
Helen was yelling, "Stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we weren't trying to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks tonight. We were just looking for a good paddle and a chance to win the race, and we did.
He's waiting a couple of years before deciding on his future.
Glover is attending the wedding next month when she marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, all he wants to do is enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on me.
It took me about six months after London to realize I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
This feels so much better, she said.
Iceland replaces government corrupted by Panama leaks
Iceland is to hold early parliamentary elections in October, as demanded by protesters angered by the Panama leaks as early as this spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had evaded taxes by using tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned over the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The date for the election has now been set for October 29.
Analysts say it's hard to predict how much the recent public anger will affect the outcome of the fall election.
In the June presidential elections, criticism of those in power was evident, and Gudni Johannesson, a candidate from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he called Obama the founder of ISIS .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has canceled his latest presidential address.
He said he was being sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama is the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was involved in its creation.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the remarks and demanded an apology from Trump.
"No one should ever be allowed to be commander in chief of the military who can sink that low", Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the Muslim-famous burkini, a covering swimsuit, from swimming pools, reports the Guardian newspaper.
A resolution signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that beaches and swimming are forbidden to anyone who does not wear a good-natured and secular swimsuit.
The decision also states that swimsuits that prominently express religious affiliation may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating France's National Day.
In late July, two men linked to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the Oulu region's bathing water has passed the filter
The water sampled from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meets the quality standards for bathing water.
Only the beach of the lake has been found to have a blue-greenish sandstone deposit.
The Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing beaches in the Oulu region on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Concentrations of E. coli and intestinal enterococci in all bathing water, except the beach of the sea bass, were below the limits of measures laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
E. coli and enterococcal levels were confirmed in the seaweed beach water on Wednesday, when the bacterial levels were below the action limits.
The bluish-green sediment found on the beach of Lake Washy does not yet render the water unsuitable for swimming, but under favourable conditions it can quickly turn into a bluish-green sediment, which forms blue-green algae on the surface of the water in the form of floats.
The Environment Agency is monitoring the situation with intensified inspections.
If the blue-green algae turns into blue-green algae, this shall also be indicated separately on the swimming pool bulletin board.
Check out the results of the bathing water samples here.
The Commission has also identified a number of other measures to reduce the impact of the forest sector on the environment.
The forest gift deduction is one of the tax changes in the Treasury's proposed budget for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of a generational gift tax on forest land.
The Ministry of Finance proposes that forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's objective is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would deduct from the net capital income of the forestry business.
The idea of creating such a tool to promote the generation-to-generation shift in forestry is a good one, says forestry director Juha Hakkarainen of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (CFAF).
But the hack finds something to criticize about the tax reform bill.
The forest gift reduction is presented as a function of the net capital income of the forest owner.
It is the capital gain after deducting all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarais, the tax reduction would be more effective if it could be made directly from the income from the sale of wood.
The MSP's proposal is based on the assumption that a deduction from the net capital income of forestry prevents the loss of capital income of forestry from being deducted from other taxes.
A person like that would get a tax break even if he didn't sell the wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is not able to grasp it, says Hakkarainen.
The Commission has also decided to initiate a formal investigation procedure in respect of the aid scheme.
The proposal limits the tax reduction linked to the value of the forest to EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled too high for the Hook.
As such, he said, it would cut 82 percent of Finnish forest owners out of the reduction zone.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of the forest ownership community, he says.
The WF is of the opinion that the border guarantees the objective of growth.
The forest policy has been taking forest gift reduction for decades, according to Hakkarainen.
The reason for this is the ageing of the forestry sector.
The CFP states that the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years and that about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm caught motorists off Himanga . Two cars slammed into a ditch and collided .
There was a strange chase on the Himanga Fish River on Friday morning.
According to the emergency services, two cars in a row plunged into a ditch, after which the one behind hit the one ahead.
According to the fire chief of the day, Harry Pyle, the fall into the ditch was suspected to be caused by a large eruption of lava.
There were two people in the back of the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There's no further information on their injuries.
The driver of the car ahead was uninjured.
The accident happened on Highway 8 from Himanga, a few kilometers to Kalaji.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research by researchers at the University of Turku may help to develop more effective cancer treatments.
The findings of a research team led by academician Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the severity of the tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells normally grow in such an environment.
Ivaska said that the cancer could be prevented from growing in the laboratory by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of cancer drugs by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results are published on August 4 in the respected journal of cell biology, Nature Communications.
The trial of the family murder of Muho continues in court. The prosecutor demands a second murder conviction.
The family murder trial of Muho continues in court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family murder in Muhos.
The other received 8 years and 4 months for, among other things, murder and aggravated robbery committed as a juvenile.
The other is serving a 12-year sentence for a murder committed as a juvenile and a grand larceny.
The convicted murderer was also convicted of gross endangerment of traffic safety as a juvenile and driving without due process as a juvenile.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal was appealed by the prosecutor, the applicants and the man who received a harsher sentence.
The prosecution is asking for a reduced sentence for a man convicted of murder committed as a juvenile to 12 years in prison.
They were fully conscious at the time of the crime.
The district court found that 17-year-old boys killed a man who worked as a child protective officer at the school in July last year.
A 17-year-old convicted of murder was sentenced to time served for attacking a school principal from behind, sitting on a living room couch.
The director had lost control and had led the young man to his room when one of the youths hit him with a vacuum tube.
The director was also strangled with a wire, beaten and kicked in the head.
The opinion poll showed that both of the convicts were fully conscious at the time of the crime.
The court found that the youths had been planning to escape from their family home since at least the day before.
The world's longest-living reef shark, it doesn't reproduce until 156 years of age
The world's longest living vertebrate has been confirmed as a glacial shark, reports a study published in the journal Science.
In the north Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice shark, known as the holler, can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156 years old.
The glacier's life span is further enhanced by its increasing by only one centimeter a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to outlive ice sharks.
Scientists used radiocarbon dating to determine the age of the body.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950's, some sharks had radioactive residue.
Using these, researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - although a throw in one direction or another could be as long as 120 years.
Donald Trump as a businessman
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the world to change.
As much as a third of all federal tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump's corporate tax reforms were implemented.
Tax revenues would also decrease, especially with tax breaks for the richest.
Trump described his tax plan as revolutionary when he unveiled it Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax rate would be reduced from 35% to 15%.
Without it, we'd be left with a very large sum, a billion dollars a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6 after Trump's proposed cut to 33.
The inheritance tax would be waived completely.
Trump accused the government of over-regulating business and bankrupting small businesses.
The hastily agreed environmental standards must be re-established and energy regulation abolished.
Barack Obama's health care reform must be reviewed.
The government must appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
Trump says "destructive" trade policies are the biggest cause of America's problems.
The free trade agreements would be abandoned.
The Commission's proposal is to introduce a 45 per cent penalty tax on imports from China and a 35 per cent penalty tax on imports from Mexico.
We're offering a new future.
"Americanism, not globalization, is our creed", Trump declared.
Donald Trump 's America is the only country in the world that needs a change:
American cars will drive the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will patrol the seas, American steel will raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his usual style, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by his aides, even though well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those close to Republicans, see Trump's program as driving the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program early Friday, Finnish time.
A tidal wave from the past
The sea is raging with a fatal storm, but a real tidal wave is brewing in the heart of a penitent Madrid. The reckoning with the past may begin.
That is the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novel story.
Almodovar's previous directorial effort, Travelers (2013), was a small-scale, rontgen-oriented satirical comedy, preceded by I Live in a Skin (2011) the pinnacle of the Spanish director's career.
Julieta (2016) is somewhere in between.
It's a classic, soft drama of love, relationships, family, with a mother and daughter at the center.
The story is simple and we see it in a lot of the long-running back stories.
Life seems to be a smooth ride for a middle-aged celebrity (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to fall apart.
In the aftermath of a chance encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is left in awe until the last few seconds of the film.
In the form of a backstory and a long letter, Julieta recounts the stages of her life to her grown daughter.
She starts with the time before her daughter was born, the moment she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
The second female lead is Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, known for the TV series Ommeltenen aika (2013-2014).
Juliet's aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a cluster, but I would say rather subtly and literally with a wipe.
Often characteristic of Almodóvar films, Juliet is a fair distance from the flamboyantness and humor.
It is a well-acted, restrained, occasionally well-musiced and rather melancholy film, with elements of elegia as such.
Instead, the visual colorfulness typical of the Spanish director is preserved, and it is gradually becoming more striking as a pure form factor than as a functioning dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are plagued by illness, death, or other sudden losses, but the surface remains the same.
This is especially true of the costume: in the case of a celebrity, the costume changes from scene to scene, and the same is true of showy earrings.
Almodóvar is very precise in these matters, but the main thing, the tuning of the scene in question, is not much improved.
When repeated mechanically, the impression is external and a little lifeless.
Almodóvar has written the screenplay based on three novels by the Canadian novelist Alice Munro, winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature.
The novels have been published in the book The Runaway: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat balanced literary filmmaking.
The film's theme deals with such big issues - especially the sinking guilt - that it would have been the ingredient for an emotionally intense drama.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
The film stars Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao and Dario Grandinetti. It was released on July 15, 2015.
The movie opens on the 12th of August.
The government is trying to rig the election .
No new cuts, the ministers are saying, so that the Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are made in a junk shop.
There will be no more cuts.
The four billion already agreed to save is enough.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
It is true that the CoR's proposal does not contain any new cuts, since the cuts to social security were decided on in the spring framework.
The family allowance, the national pension, the basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400 days.
The training cuts are still in effect.
The Municipal Elections Are Haunting
Why do ministers insist so emphatically that no further cuts should be made to these people?
Because next year is an election year.
The municipal elections are held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the election season, not the polls.
It has been seen in the past that a result in a municipal election that leads the governing parties in different directions spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
However, Gallup reports that the ruling party, the Finns of the Left, is expected to suffer a crushing defeat, despite its modest 12.3% result in the previous elections.
Four years ago, the Fundamentalists won 752 new councillors, many of whom will pay the price of their influence in a rightwing government next spring.
The lifeline of the three governments of approximately equal size depends on the survival of the Finnish base.
Now it has not lasted, and more than half of the party voters had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's position have also come to the surface.
The rhetoric of no new cuts is, firstly, to obscure the fact that they will be made in a big way next year and, secondly, to try to soften the blow that basic Finns are waiting for.
Major surgery in 2018?
In a year, things will probably be different if the Squirrel government is still in power.
The government has set itself the objective of reducing debt this election year, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will take on a debt of EUR 5.9 billion next year, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise our hands in the middle of an election cycle and admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: the debt is not being paid or even slowed down.
The other is to stick to the program.
This means further, even more severe cuts on top of the old ones in the 2017 budgetary period.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring parliamentary elections, we will face what comes.
These measures did not reduce the debt
It is quite clear that the current measures have not helped to reduce the debt, despite Juha Sipilä's efforts to create a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäe at the budget briefing are proof of this:
The forecasts for global growth have repeatedly proved to be academic, meaning that there is no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not recovered much since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy of the early 2010s.
Unemployment has risen by 35 percent in this decade, rising on average from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros more per year than in 2008.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet adopted any specific recommendations on the restructuring plan.
What's responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt settlement proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected as being irresponsible.
The cost of maintaining unemployment next year is about EUR 6 billion, which will be covered almost entirely by new debt.
This is the idea of the Centre, the association and the Finnish people about what is responsible.
Question: Many tasks are left to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of day care, youth work and sport is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
The vast majority of the population also assigns responsibility for libraries, culture, civic education, building control, secondary education and waste management to individual municipalities.
The responsibility of the Länder is more clearly defined in the areas of regional planning, specialised health care, vocational training, vocational colleges and institutional care for the developmentally disabled.
No tasks of municipal order are to be transferred to the State.
A juvenile driver was driving under the influence of alcohol and ran away from the police at the end of the chase .
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu fled a police patrol on Ilomantsintie in Joensuu on Friday night at 1:30 a.m.
Police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man ran away from the police at a fairly high speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanprand, then to Sorronahonti and a smaller forest road where the motorcycle went off the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster-moving policeman caught up with the fugitive.
The breath test on the driver showed 0.75 per millimeter.
He also did not have a license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck that was carrying the rocks fell into the ditch.
The truck, loaded with rocks, fell into a ditch at Kolvijärv on Kaavinti Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had veered off the road at a left-hand corner and had fallen on its side into a ditch.
The rescue team lifted the injured driver out of the fallen truck through the door above, along with the rescue helicopter crew and paramedics.
The car was to be hauled by the owner.
The truck that fell spilled hydraulic oil onto the road, which the rescue team absorbed into the peat.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon in the Wind River.
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in the Gulf of Ilmajoen in the southeastern part of the country.
Police are looking for a woman about 5'6", thin and stocky, with white hair that reaches down to her chin.
Any observations or clues about the missing person's movements are requested by calling the Nordic Situation Centre on 0295440513.
The elements of the great accident in the air . See the photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest .
The falling tide that toppled the tents of the Parafest festivals caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, chairman of the Riverside Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be able to recover financially and that the event could be held again next year.
The last performer of Parafest Kalle Salonen performed on the market stage at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances at the city theater, starting at 1 p.m.
The Art Center in Ahjos is hosting a Parafest exhibition at 1 to 3 p.m.
The program will be organized as planned.
A downpour is created in a thundercloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a downward flow of air.
The changes in the water shape of the thunder cloud bind heat, and as a result, the falling air cools and accelerates its speed toward the earth.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that fall flows occur in Finland several times during the summer.
The path of the falling currents is difficult to predict.
A downpour hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, the site of the Parafest, Friday afternoon just before 5:00.
Three tents fell apart, and there were about 200 people in total.
Four people suffered minor injuries in the accident.
Among them was a child who was taken to the emergency room with minor injuries.
Air pollution is aging Londoners
A study shows that Londoners age faster than normal.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The British investigation is reported by the Evening Standard.
British skincare company Caci analyzes the most toxic particles in London's air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many Londoners of retirement age have skin two and a half years older than their rural counterparts.
Skin-aging particles are a very fine dust pollution from transportation fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory illnesses that kill nearly 9,500 Londoners each year, according to the Evening Standard.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin.
The CAC study found that premature aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who commute by walking near busy streets.
Londoners may try to protect themselves from air pollution by wearing masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor brakes failed . He pushed the man in front .
The man had been moving rocks in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to walk in front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor fell on him.
The man was not hit, but the tractor managed to push him enough to take him to the central hospital for further examination with serious injuries.
The tractor could not go any farther because it hit the rocks in front of it.

Garchet is a corresponding dealer, the Brazilian is 198 centimeters.
Through Josba, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. National Team.
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every World Salibandy Championship since 2003.
Now in its sixth year, Tampere is missing only 2013 as Canada was better in the North American qualifiers.
I was working in Turku, playing with the local women, when I saw the ad.
The U.S. was setting up a national team for the Salibandi.
I got interested, and here we are, says Jumppanen, 48.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 in Elizabeth, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensu, the sport was not yet played at the SM level as salibandy.
They used to play chess in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later ice hockey in the SM-liiga in the Rokipoika.
Jumppanen played for the university team in the SM-liiga of salibandy in the season 1991-92, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-Team girls to the state championship.
The women's SM series peaked at silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM-liiga 10 times, with a total of 169 matches.
The last SM season was 2001-02.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänäinen were named to the national team
Josba, a member of the Salibandy team from the River Island, was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen, a native of Enna, was selected to play for the Finnish national team in the Czech Republic's Brno EFT tournament on November 6-8.
The 25-year-old attacker Perttu Puska has played this game in Helsinki's Erä before six men's matches in which he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
Switzerland's 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen has recovered from hip pain and is a regular in the national team with 117 caps.
The national team also included Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at the World Cup in December.
The head coach of the Salibandy national team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volleyball great Essi Hassu's circle closes to Kouvola, missing the SM gold from the prize pool.
Essi Hasu is retiring as a beach volleyball player, at least temporarily, after the current season.
The Finnish Beach Volleyball Championship will be decided this weekend at the Kouvola Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, medals will be contested in both the adult and youth categories.
The SM-final tournament, organised by Kouvola Flight Flyers and the Finnish Flight Football Association, will be contested by the top six pairs in each series.
The local team is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volleyball team for many years.
Now living in Helsinki, Hasu looks forward to the games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible can get in the theater this weekend.
I'm sure baseball stadium is gonna be a great arena.
I haven't played in the adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu feels.
The Kouvola region sparked Hassu's passion for sports and provided a fine meal for a fine pastime.
I'm sure you'll have many memories of your childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of nine in the E-girls of Elimäe NMKY.
The main thing in mind is the oversized jerseys, the knee-highs on the ankles, and the tremendous ace-screams and choreography after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The spirit of the group created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were very involved - the father of a teammate coached us, and our mother was the club president for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyball was already a natural for the sport as a counterweight to indoor volleyball in junior.
The curved pool beach has been playing a beat since the 1990s.
The activity on the runway has always been active.
I also went to see the Junior SM Tour side events myself, thinking that one day I would be there playing myself.
Now this dream is coming true when Hasu plays this weekend alongside the beatnik Anniina Parkis in the SM finals.
After Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahti, the second-ranked duo in the tournament, the goal is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still have the SM gold missing from the prize box, and Hasu throws it puzzlingly.
This weekend's performance in Kouvola may be Hasso's last in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await us in the civil service.
I'm sure after the Little Rock tournament, my international career will be over.
Otherwise, the toenails will be nailed, at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon Koli boldly set out to become a farmer
Farming as an entrepreneurial activity involves risk-taking, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in the countryside.
Just two years ago, Koli and his younger brother, Walter, began to operate as a continuation of their home.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and counsels the brothers from his own experience.
Starting out as a farmer meant taking on debt and expanding the farm so that the bread could come from farming.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always enjoyed working on a farm, and now that I'm starting my own business, I've put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think you should do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a backyard water system, and at first, the bank wasn't too keen on it.
However, I was very brave to join the project and I have been fully involved in it, says Salomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything will turn out for the better.
Salomon Kol, a meat-carrier, is planning to invest in an even larger hub.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected as one of the top ten in the Rural Future magazine's Young Food Producer competition.
Right now, he's competing for a possible win.
You can vote for him on the paper's website until August 21.
Bulgaria reports inflation for first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % in July.
This is the highest figure for years (since June 2012) and the first figure above zero since October last year, when a positive 0,2 % was reported.
The annual average inflation rate, as measured by the cost of living index, was -0,8% over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015).
The cost of living index in July 2016 was 101,0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1,0%.
The Commission notes that the increase in the number of Union producers of bicycles is due to the increase in the number of passengers using bicycles.
Compared to the previous month, the following consumer goods showed an increase in price in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7 %), transport (1,8 %), leisure and culture (6,3 %), restaurants and hotels (1,2 %), mixed goods and services (0,3 %).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcohol and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's anime effect is being criticized as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat says the anime has served as inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it's racist.
Snapchat uses its lens tool to enable its 150 million daily users to manipulate reality and play with their identities in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that would fit in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are simple, facial-twisting tools that produce over 30 million improved selfies a day.
Any misdirection will quickly end up in public records.
Snapchat's lenses have previously come under fire for allegations that the app promotes blackface or whiteface masks or favors a lighter skin tone as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat advertised this week to some users for a lens that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - Yellowface, or yellowface.
And they wondered if these recurring controversies might be a sign of a bigger problem for the company with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it was shutting down the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was intended to be a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But to observers who had experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of the offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently opposed the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet of the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at the very least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that it was difficult to argue against a comparison between the gross Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to the extreme of degradation.
Snapchat isn't the only company that's overcoming these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood to the devices we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge, racially diverse audience of young people may mean that they're even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image, it's much harder for these guys to stay hidden than it used to be.
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In a letter to Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believed that the racial disputes reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mainly white male leadership and ended his post with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat.
Either they don't have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their workforce, which is why they are able to make these kinds of decisions, said Chinese-American Zhu, or they have people of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or can speak directly.
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely ignored.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce, citing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but a representative said the company hired a recruiter some time ago to focus on underrepresented populations and advance internal inclusion efforts.
For his part, Zhu said that he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to say this is not okay".
A congressional panel has concluded that military officials misrepresented ISIS intelligence.
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel said officials at the headquarters of the U.S. military's war zone had edited intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what the events on the ground justified.
A mid-year review report by a task force formed by the Republican chairman of the House Defense Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread dissatisfaction" among intelligence analysts at HQ, who said their superiors were rigging their assessments of American efforts to defeat ISIS.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the Armed Forces War Area in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
Intelligence output approved by senior Centcom executives typically provided a more positive picture of US counterterrorism efforts than the facts on the ground justified. It was consistently more positive than analysis produced by other actors in the intelligence community, the report's press release said.
"The actions of Centcom are unacceptable - our combatants in the war suffer when poor analysis is presented to high-level decision makers", said Representative Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The failures of Centcom's management reach right to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report details ongoing problems in the HQ's descriptions and analysis of US efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that high-level administration officials in the Obama administration ordered the reports to be tampered with, it does illustrate that analysts felt that they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to portray the threat posed by the Islamic State in a more positive light.
Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and testimonies to Congress from the HQ were significantly more positive than the events themselves, the report said.
For example, the Centcom authority publicly stated that a major offensive to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear", said Representative Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence leaders at the US military operations headquarters manipulated the intelligence output of the headquarters to reduce the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, will be followed by wider findings as the investigation continues.
The inspector general of the Department of Defense has opened an additional ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings, which were consistent with the final conclusions of some Republican task forces.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a needlessly isolated process of intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces", said Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's Democratic leader, in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process prolonged the publication of intelligence , dampened the mood among analysts and made insufficient room for divergent views.
Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "set or political narrative".
The Daily Beast is reporting on Tuesday on the preliminary findings of a congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's inspector general had launched an investigation after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Captain Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the MoD welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential national security issues.
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (as a growing number of defense officials now claim).
Last year's accusations raised questions about how much President Obama can trust the White House to provide honest assessments of war efforts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflects a controversy that began more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article saying that despite the objections of many analysts, the administration of President George W. Bush supported a small military force in Iraq and spent very little time considering the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker was also a key player in the rebellion over Islamic State intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, the airstrikes on the Islamic State-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy, as it had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
However, The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under fire last year after many lawmakers deemed his testimony to the Senate an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced at headquarters by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins its fourth straight women 's ice hockey title , hosting a matchup with Great Britain .
The day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's national field hockey team on Thursday in a 3-0 win over India.
Five goals in two games sounds like a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27, said he wasn't sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea", he said.
I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a journal of paintings.
But he knows this: the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and they share first place in their group with Great Britain, who were still unbeaten after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face off in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have qualified for the quarterfinals, and this game will decide who will place first and second in their six-team group.
The first place team will avoid the strong Netherlands, the leader of the second group, for a little longer in the quarterfinals.
However Saturday's game ends, the Americans have caused a stir with their surprise success here, four years after finishing last out of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a field hockey stick at age 3 (his older twin sisters played at Drexel) before joining the national team at age 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
He was not selected for the 2008 Olympics because he did not make the final roster.
In 2012, nothing went right for him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed as coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change", Bam said.
We didn't have the same work schedule in London as we have now.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam kicked off the first half with a close-range punch.
India had come into the game with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the situation 1-0 until the end of the third inning, when Bam took control of the situation.
He carried the ball long to the left of the field, then went around the middle and pulled the ball into the goal, leading the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth.
This was the first-ever tie for U.S. goalie Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of his first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now", Parnham said, "but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game".
The peace of the trampoline in the midst of the Olympic flame
Wherever you are, whatever the weather, the Olympics are underway.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be continuous and inevitable, with a furious message of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic flame itself were a fiery message, passed from archer to swimmer and gymnast to triathlete.
It is impossible to turn on the television, read the newspaper or listen to a conversation in a coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympian and future heartbreaker with a smile on his face, might well be one of those names that everyone knows, that is, that is presented at prime time and supported by sponsorship deals and goodwill TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for the Olympic gold medal in the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species equally.
Farther from the center, in part in the shade, are the sports not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, volleyball, taekwondo.
We always have a bra, long live it.
But if I may make a modest number of my particular favorites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained allure of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its debut at the Sydney Games, its presence has been so neglected in the intervening 16 years that many of those I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal, and its athlete did not advance to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share the men's medals, the Chinese and the Canadians the women's.
This year, Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their gold medals in London.
However, there is a certain underdog appeal to the trampoline, in part because to the uneducated ear it sounds more like a clown school than an Olympic event.
I have to admit, I'm no expert on this. I'm just a fan of flying skills.
The sport has the potential for entertainment, as seen in the vibrations of the endless bounces in cartoons, but it also has the serenity of gymnastics and swimming, two sports that are essentially combined.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, meaning a jumping board.
The championship contenders jump almost 30 feet onto a giant trampoline, performing a series of twisting movements (turns, bends, and volts) before finally landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are judged on performance, difficulty and flight time.
There are 32 athletes competing in Rio from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympic orientation is straight forward.
The medalists must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth across the field.
They are not only chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in television news, another ridiculous frontier: the world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical, and can even bring tears to the eye.
But that's also why watching the games can be a little tiring.
The trampoline offers a break from this.
The trampoline is heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new ascent, appearing as weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up again.
This is not without competition and difficulty, of course, but there is no frantic rush to the finish, no jumps over distances, only a dreamlike, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to zen as you can get at the Olympics.
The women's qualifying and then the final will be on Friday afternoon at 1pm ET, with the men's race also coming up on Saturday at 1pm.
NBC will be broadcasting the finals as part of its afternoon programming beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic high, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is likely to go unnoticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is only achieved by offering male athletes to be stared at and objectified (as the U.S. men's gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
A generation is showing its mind in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia on the brink of collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a staunch ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-government protests have shaken the country as they spread to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights groups say the government's response has been ruthless.
Witnesses said that police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
The widespread videos of the protests, believed to date from late last year or early this year, show security officials beating young people with sticks while forcing them to stand with their hands against a wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a full investigation.
Keeping this country together has always been difficult, and it will be even more difficult in the future, said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project manager at the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and Western countries value its stability.
The American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against the terrorist threat in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved tremendously, and the capital, Addis Ababa, even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe, and clean.
But while Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights groups have consistently spoken out against government oppression, the country's opposition has been limited, and dissent has been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
If you suppress people and they have no choice but to show their opinion, this is what will happen, said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All the young people are showing their minds.
One generation shows its mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the strangulation of the ruling coalition.
After the much-criticized elections last year, the ruling party and its allies won the last opposition seat and now hold all the seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising on the border with Eritrea, where fighting along the tense and contentious border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to take advantage of the upheaval and rearm.
A number of factors explain why, after years of hiding beneath the surface, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first seems to be a seemingly harmless one: smartphones.
Only in the last few years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, with the proliferation of cheaper smartphones and improved Internet access.
Even if the government closes Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during protests, many people can still send messages through hidden web proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for the demonstrations.
Second, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, the Oromo and Amharic, get along better.
The Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For a long time, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's mostly Christian highlands, prospered politically and commercially by exploiting the Oromo people, many of whom are Muslims and live in the highlands.
But this is changing, too.
We are on the way to organizing under one umbrella, Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu said.
The largest protests have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many Amharic and Oromo people feel that Ethiopia is unfairly governed by the Tigre people, who make up about 6 percent of the population and control the military, intelligence, trade, and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died of a mysterious illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at spotting early signs of discontent and using secret agents to neutralize opponents.
The current administration lacks such a basic instinct, said conflict analyst Abdi.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' shoes.
Unlike Meles, who was from the tiger region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the security services, controlled by the tigers, don't trust him.
Many fear that this could lead to more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such turmoil was in 2005, when thousands demonstrated against an election that analysts said appeared to be rigged and then looted by the government.
The ensuing crackdown killed many protesters, although fewer than in recent months, and the period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure design, including a new commuter train, and for their remarkable progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the growing contempt for the Ethiopian government from within the country.
And now it's starting to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked tiger-owned businesses, and anti-tiger hatred is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in a difficult position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for flights to neighboring Somalia, even though it recently said it was closing that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its already unstable allies in the region to collapse.
This, Abdi said, is a real balance.
Donald Trump explains his Obama-based ISIS claim as "sarcasm".
Donald J. Trump tried to stifle his latest campaign controversy on Friday by claiming he was not serious when he repeatedly this week implied that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who had been scrambling to defend him during a tumultuous time, in a difficult position, having to explain remarks he may not have meant.
After the insinuation made at Wednesday night's campaign rally, Trump made the same claim with increasing enthusiasm in Thursday's interviews, in which he implied that his intention was indeed to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in a tweet early Friday morning, Trump said he was only being sarcastic.
The publication was a complete reversal of the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed concerned about the serious accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump trumpet his remarks by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took it to his ears.
The latest storm of criticism comes as Trump has sought to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining polling results.
Trump and Clinton fought while talking about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on the subject.
Returning to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
In late July, after he faced widespread criticism for apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack into Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying "Of course I'm being sarcastic".
The approach allows Trump to go on a political speech at the border and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans, he sees how they work and then he 'explains' one way or another depending on the reaction", said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's very clever about his statements and knows they're vague enough to be filtered through a number of different lenses.
Instead of toning down his speeches for the large voting audience, Trump has been more blunt in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed that Trump is far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump generally avoids apologizing for provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces increasing scrutiny in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an awkward position of having to publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in a CNN interview Thursday.
"I believe there are real, political comments in his words", Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton established an Islamic state.
It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was a little unknown, little organization that he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that's why this happened, because he pulled his troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, under Clinton as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to deteriorate because it failed to effectively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday's Pennsylvania rallies, Trump continued his Twitter attack on the news media, which gossip about his every word and are biased against him.
He mocked the "bad, pathetic" television pundits who tried to get rid of him, saying "They can't do it!"
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump's apology as further evidence that he is unfit to be president.
A formerly closed coffee shop returns to Greenpoint .
The Verb Cafe was a seedy cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn't have wireless, but it offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the Bedford Avenue side of the street was too expensive for her.
The store that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals mourned it as the latest loss to a middle-class city undergoing redevelopment.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is a wreck and Verb is now a soap shop".
But if New York is change, it's also reinvention.
The revived Verb opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and credit cards, but some of the staff is still the same, and the atmosphere is still unpretentious.
The coffee's still good.
The new Verbi is being run by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe who is now the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001, and he stayed until the end.
When the client offered to finance her new place, she said she was thrilled.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel vendor and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it, too.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon and chicken egg cheese sandwiches, and the toppings include capers and browned onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
The cafe doesn't serve beer anymore, but they make fresh juices.
Over the past nine months, Rodriguez says he's noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
Williamsburg was becoming too expensive for many former customers too, he said.
One of the clients was Rebecca Oliveira last Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and was a regular at Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he kept walking to the coffee shop.
He says that when Verb shut down, he gave up coffee for a while.
"I realized I enjoyed Verbe's coffee and culture", she said.
Now he is back to coffee, although that day he ordered a blended chai, one of the new additions, instead of his regular iced coffee.
Another longtime customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been a regular at Verb since 2003.
He used to work there and he always ordered the same thing.
"Every day after seven o'clock, regularly as the clock, I went in and they were making my bagel with butter from spices", she said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but occasionally, for a change, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg, and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against the soap shop that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make Verbe a special soap with the ingredient of the cold brew coffee of the cafe.
"I think we can still take the offer", said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also embraced the cafe.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he plans to display it soon in some area to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
There's a local juice shop that wants to bottle and sell cold brew coffee.
It's possible the cafe will expand into the building next door.
A lot of customers are satisfied with getting their old favorites at the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the place closed.
When the new place opened, Whitt said that he felt like he had come home when he walked in and ordered coffee.
"I've been wanting to smell it", he said.
A Square Meal: the paralyzing food of the Depression.
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in his office.
President Roosevelt's favorite delicacy was refined Fifth Avenue food, such as goose liver patties and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day, her diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potatoes, and a dessert of plum onion.
"It was a show of culinary solidarity for people who were suffering", said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
A couple in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side apartment building through food in 97 Orchards.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, to be published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
In a show of their own culinary solidarity, they meet a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unassuming lunch bar in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese and olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a serving of turkey, potato chips and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meatloaf, the couple thought it appropriate to discuss eating during the depression.
"The strawberries were very popular", said Ziegelman.
There was peanut butter, liver butter, bean butter.
They were made from ingredients and some cheap ingredient that was added to the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make your dinner.
Coe was grinning.
"It must have felt like a lead weight in your stomach", she said.
In the years before the Depression, the tables of Americans, especially in rural areas, were like the eat-as-you-want-to-eat tables.
Women's groups cooked for the male farm workers, and fresh pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicles how the nation survived the sudden change from a land of plenty.
"At that time, food became a central, pressing issue for Americans", Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally pressing was the new, inexpensive diet: Mystery dishes like muffins and boxes became staples, and the box was "a great way to use food sources", Ziegelman said, because chefs were able to hide less appealing ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which had been the centerpiece of American meals for years, became a sparingly-priced luxury item.
Special formulations were tried when calories and nutrients were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While researching for a book of recipes, Ziegelman prepared a contemporary dish that filled fried onions with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table", Coe said.
Ziegelman was specific: "It was unreal".
Peanut butter is not really for fried onions.
This was typical of many household recipes.
Household economists, such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Housing Administration from 1923 to 1943, guided the nation's eating habits more than ever before or since.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budget makers" and to meet the challenge of turning blended spaghetti and carrots into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic delicacies.
Especially tasty are accounts of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While he was publicly praising his childhood's simple Iowa country food, he ate like the refined millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish in gravy", Coe said.
He was eating in the almost gold dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was so out of it.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, hadn't encouraged him to be an example with his own stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that offered not only the worst of Washington's food, but the worst of its preparation.
Many of the Laman dietary practices were abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
The legacy is our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that in writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food", Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick".
There was a wind-hat incident.
After the plates were empty at Eisenberg, he and Coe brought out a dessert they had made at home: the plum pudding that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum cream", said Ziegelman, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a name that showed off.
The dessert was no whipped cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped their spoons into the sticky brown paper.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Coe danced once and then again.
He sounded like a positive budgeter and told his wife: "A few chopped nuts might help".
Gilead is being reimbursed for its legal fees in the Hepatitis C patent battle against Merck.
A United States District Judge has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc. to pay legal costs in a case involving a hepatitis C patient against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. Inc.
In June, Gilead was cleared of $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's successful drugs, Swald and Harvon, following a U.S. judge's finding of Merck's misconduct involving perjury and other unethical practices.
In a judgment handed down Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to relief from damages it received in the appeal.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which is dominating the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other over ownership of the laboratory work behind Gilead's active drug, sofosbuvir.
US-backed forces say they have completely taken control of Isis-controlled Manbij.
US-backed forces have completely taken control of the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now searching the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The forces had freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF's ally, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we have begun to investigate", he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% of their federal income tax.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and his wife earned $10.75 million that year, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, primarily the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees, and former Secretary of State announced he received $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for his book about his career at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, have released their 10-year tax returns.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from interested parties.
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are setting the bar for financial transparency, Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and reverses his earlier promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to file their tax returns even though they are not required to do so by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have filed a tax audit to justify his refusal to release his tax returns.
"Your turn", said Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams on Twitter, posting a link to the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits were complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business dealings, and numerous other ties, including to Russia.
Clinton has grabbed on to the problem by posting a video online Friday featuring prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in the last decades has done: publish his tax returns, he told the audience.
Politico reported that Trump has paid no or very little in taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted numerous tax lawyers and accountants who said the situation may still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those making more than $1 million a year pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he too was undergoing a tax audit and that Trump was not afraid of the IRS, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has been releasing tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, had a real federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their combined real tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their primary investment was a low-cost index-linked mutual fund, and the Clintons reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chilean condoms and lightning bolts boost elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements - they throw condoms filled with chili powder at the animals.
The technique has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea several years ago, along with the U.S. Nature Conservancy, has been promoting it by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent four-step method to protect homes and livestock without harming animals.
In the past, many people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
Since we developed...the tools, we have seen a change in attitudes in these communities, who are now much more confident in their ability to keep elephants out of their fields without harming them, said Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps involve pointing a flashlight at an invading elephant and blowing the horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, we throw what's called a "chilli cloud".
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and dirt and lightning, and then the condom is rolled up so that only the ignition wire is visible.
When you light the condom, it explodes, popping and spewing chili powder into the air.
One whiff of scent is usually enough to send an elephant the other way.
As a last resort, the trigger fires a Roman candle into the air, and the bonfire produces a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli number at Arab request
A French filmmaker of Jewish background has sparked a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list an Israeli area code, according to an employee, due to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, the maker of the Holocaust documentary, expressed his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find the Israeli hotel in the country code list.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which direct calls from a hotel room are allowed.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been eliminated and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility to call Israel through its own call centre.
In search of an explanation, the filmmaker brought it up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the response "shocked" him.
The hotel receptionist said it was a deliberate decision by the Kempinski Hotel management.
The reason for the decision was even more shocking to the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they are demanding that the Israeli number be removed", the worker is quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, calls the case "a grave injustice", reports the Zuddeutsche Zeitung.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great injustice.
But the greater shame is that this is what happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions", the official said.
The incident caused quite a backlash online, with people calling it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply gave in to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you", said another publication, noting that the hotel on the beautiful Kurfurstendamm Street is near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all the allegations, calling the incident "insensitivity" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
The clear order not to include Israel on the shortlist was never given, Kempinski's representative is quoted as saying by the Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the directional number has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as students gathered to protest against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problems started when law enforcement tried to disperse the student crowd, which led to the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students joined the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
São Paulo State Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin proposed that just under 100 public schools be closed and 300,000 students relocated to save money.
Some protesters were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration came just days after protesters marched in unison to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff in the Senate vote on her impeachment.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly grows by 71%
Since the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased 70.9 percent year on year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
The Ambassador said that after the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown a large interest in doing business in the country.
Russian companies will continue their existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, one of the main objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is to expand trade, Dzhagaryan said.
The Commission also noted that the Russian authorities did not provide any information on the level of the export price of the product concerned to the Union.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to a total of USD 697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved by the supply of machinery, vehicles and arms, the Ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Embassy in Iran issued some 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran also became one of the 20 countries with the highest number of tourists in Russia for the first time.
It is probably safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists to Russia will be broken, he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition, he said.
Scot Callum Skinner , who was on the line when the British captured the cycling gold .
Scotland's Callum Skinner competed for the title in the men's team sprint at Rio's Cycling Stadium last night as the trio of Great Britain defended their 2012 London championship.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role as his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy recovered, the legend proud of the youngster as he fought to the finish line to capture the pre-favourite victory over the New Zealand team.
Britain took a shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won his fifth of six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the World Track Championships in London in March, even though Hoy has since retired from racing.
The problem between the Beijing and London Games was the replacement of special envoy Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time for Hindes to appear.
Hoy's demise also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man that the British coaches held onto for the Scottish potential that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner set an Olympic record in the time trial, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold medal match.
Hindes was trailing by a narrow margin after his own lap, but Kenny pushed the lead and Skinner held on.
The change in strategy was a big part of the change in form, and that included Hindes driving a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny, and especially Skinner, to keep up.
Hoy, in his capacity as BBC expert, caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped onto the podium.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, said: "The comparison is flattering".
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world championship.
It was just incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning the 2012 London Marathon with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a poor start.
He later retracted his comment and the British competitors have not complained.
This time, the overwhelming victory was not a problem.
Hindes said: 'It felt like being in London with so many British flags on the podium.'
As a team, we've found a connection over the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for the nation that won seven of the ten cycling races in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the progress of the last five months, we have a successful five days ahead of us at the cycling stadium.
Given Kenny's good behavior, it's not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoey's record of winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (that apparently holy day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would have a total of six gold and one silver.
It'd be the same as Hoyt.
Kenny will compete next in the sprint, which starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old man from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one.
Team competition is always the best.
It's a win-win situation with the guys.
To win alone is, frankly, lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be knighted".
This was the only medal match of the day, but Britain had more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in the four-person, four-kilometer team pursuit in the history of the race.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record for the 2012 London Olympics gold is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will surely be the center of attention.
He had a disagreement with the judges yesterday before the deadline when officials called him in for a height test.
In the women's race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngave advanced in a world record time as the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its mighty track cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympics and achieve a full set of medals.
After a truly exceptional and perfect show of control in Beijing and London, expectations have been lowered ahead of the Rio Games.
There has been drama, not the least of which was the departure of technical director Shane Sutton in April over accusations of sexism and harassment, and the end of the racing careers of big names like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night's races at the cycling stadium, it seems that Britain's now legendary reputation for rising to the top at the perfect moment could once again be justified.
The future of Portland smelter in question because of cutting power contract
The future of Portland's Victoria aluminum smelter, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain after the power company that supplies the plant with electricity revealed that one of the plant's owners is in the process of terminating a distribution agreement, so all distribution contracts can be expected to be cut.
The measure follows a decision by the Victorian Government earlier this year to not extend the subsidies needed to keep the plant running.
The aid period of 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk, directly or indirectly, if the plant closes.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, since the smelter uses about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
The Alcoa Portland smelter is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has more recently been due to the price of the plant's production.
AGL, which supplies electricity to the large aluminium smelter at its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it was also waiting for the three other owners to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the plant is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina group and smaller shares are held by CITIC of China and Marubeni Corp of Japan.
AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the unmet physical electricity demand will continue, it said.
The Commission notes that the AGL was not granted a derogation from the AGL.
The contracts have a notice period of 12 months and therefore effectively expire in 2017.
The Commission therefore concludes that the AGL is not a State aid measure within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of any aid measure in the form of State aid.
AGL said that it had already 'depreciated' the contracts in its accounts by $187 million, 'with anticipation of completion'.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts would not affect Alcoa's ability to ... maintain the smelter or to secure the smelter's electricity supply.
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the agreement was to come into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the agreement.
Analysts have been wary of the potential closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle, because of the poor economic situation in the industry.
Earlier this week, AGL CEO Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both plants withdraw from the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
For us as electricity producers, this would not be good", he said.
Kendall, not just the reality star of the Kardashians, is on the cover of September's Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager, fourth daughter of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of America's most coveted September issue of Vogue.
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has modeled at Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Watching this cover in a room full of people I love made me cry", Kendall wrote.
The cover ad was followed by a quirky (or maybe just Kardashian-style?), scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (except for troubled Rob and Caitlyn, and including everyone's favorite entertainer, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot about their sister's cover, but ended in a classic twist: they planned a surprise party.
It's the clichéd plot of almost every "birthday episode" of a children's television show (Seacrest says the lines) but Kris had to get his other girls to somehow benefit from this publicity.
That's because we've definitely entered a new Kardashian era with the September issue of Vogue.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made the cover of Vogue first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September issue is in a class of its own.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, and the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of last year's 832-page booklet contained advertising).
The cover star is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official release.
Previous female cover artists include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Indeed, in recent years there have been more classified models on the cover than classified models.
Oscar-winning Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was crowned.
But if Jenner, described by the magazine as the "model of success" of her generation, were to fall into that category first, she would be in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of celebrities or reality stars or today's youth who can make a good Snapchat video (even though Jenner is all of these things).
They are, with good reason, talented women who are thriving in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, the cover model of last year, has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be a mess.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment".
This feeling was brought to the surface again by Jenner's Vogue cover.
But to be in dissatisfaction is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you some Estee Lauder makeup.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own apps, behind the paywall.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that he took for Love magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids, she's a real TV star.
The Community's judicial centres turn away 160 000 people a year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from the Community's legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the impact of further cuts on its already frontier operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those without the opportunity to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away when they seek free legal advice and representation.
The legal services, already stretched to the outermost limits of the Community, are preparing for further cuts.
By June next year, these legal centers will lose 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of Queensland's Community Legal Centres, said that the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres census report shows that thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said if the federal government's decision is not reversed, things will only get worse.
Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning that every year thousands of people are turned away from essential services they need, he said.
People leaving abusive relationships, with unmanageable and crippling debt, divorced families, unfairly dismissed employees - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent in June 2017, which means thousands of vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately reverse these cuts so that people can get the help they need with their legal problems.
Last year, the state government delivered on its promise to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
It is time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and its client communities and the Palaszczuk Government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after an employee was allegedly threatened with a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign is being sued for alleged inaction after being told that the campaign's North Carolina operations chief threatened an employee with a gun in February while they were driving in a Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordin, a former software intern for the state campaign.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that 'that was not going to happen'.
Chief Earl Phillip pulled out a gun, put his right thumb on the trigger and pushed a pipe against Vincent's kneecap, Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip, the complaint said.
'The weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage,' Bordini said in the application.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused outrage by telling a crowd in North Carolina that "the people of the Second Amendment" - which generally refers to gun owners and gun owners - could take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to choose judges.
Trump's campaign said the media has taken his words out of context and that he does not advocate violence.
Mr. Bordini's lawsuit seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance and from Phillip for violence, assault and causing emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local news agency in Charlotte, reports that Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Service was not immediately answered.
The campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been controversial.
The Court of Justice of the European Union has consistently held that the Commission's decision to initiate proceedings against the applicant is not in itself justified.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow brings regeneration and prosperity to the whole country, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was the great attraction of the London 2012 Games, when we went to great lengths to ensure that all our people and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we're doing that again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
The creation of 10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs for local communities alone and the elimination of youth unemployment around the airport.
As in the run-up to the London 2012 Games, some are coming to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games and that we would be shamed in front of the world.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they'll be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion has the potential to create up to 180,000 new jobs and £211 billion of economic growth, and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have delivered an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and within budget: from T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years running, to T2, which was built between the world's two busiest runways.
Now the team is ready to build a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private money.
The London 2012 Olympics were a great success for Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is one too.
It is time we channeled the Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow, secured the future of our trade and created a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook to block ads in cat and mouse games
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to bypass ad blocking is a game of cat and mouse, said one of the companies that makes such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would remove ad blockers from its desktop pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update the program's filters to block ads again on the social network's pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it was changing the code of its website around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's bypassed the new code.
In a blog post, Ben Williams, a spokesman for Adblock, wrote that "a back and forth battle like this between the open source ad blocking community and its perpetrators has been going on since ad blocking was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how much the industry has become upset about ad blockers.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year by PageFair and Adobe, nearly four times the number who used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million daily active users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is pursuing ad blockers for computer-based pages because mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook's mobile applications for the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue for Facebook to consider this kind of activity worth the investment.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its advertising preferences tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were a concern because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
This is not a good experience for people, and we plan to address the problem, a Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mail.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
A woman was hit by a car on a Swiss highway. Apparently a suicide.
Victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are searching for witnesses after a woman was struck by multiple vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday in what appeared to be a suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman "did a desperate act" and lay in the dark on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, police in Vaud said in a statement.
The victim, who was clearly attempting suicide, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, police said, urging them and any witnesses to report.
A criminal investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It remains to be seen, however, whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was there any way to avoid the collision?
That's for the prosecutor to decide, Hofstetter said.
Two similar incidents in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held accountable.
In both cases - both involving a person walking on a dark highway - it was estimated that motorists cannot expect to encounter a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the paper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of charges of negligent homicide after he struck and killed a man lying on the A! near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the road, the court was told.
The court found that the police officer responding to the distress call was driving reasonably and that the man's presence on the road was 'a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation', the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA 's climate model: Venus was once inhabited
According to a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabited.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, dehydrated surface and carbon dioxide-filled atmosphere, may have once had Earthlike conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation is due to its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus could have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still have been able to rotate slowly.
The model also looked at the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet probably had drier areas than Earth, but it once had enough water and geographic diversity to support life and protect it from rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of a sun 30 percent fainter.
In a GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its sun to the sun for almost two months at a time, explained GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in a news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick cloud layer that acts as a rain shade, protecting much of the surface from the sun's heat.
As a result, the average temperature of the climate is actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's present.
The model produced a story of Venus' development that is similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was probably once inhabited, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with its deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - the Venus we know today.
The scientists shared the results of their new model of the climate of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is giving up his Avalanche coaching job.
Patrick Roy resigned as Colorado Avalanche head coach and vice president of hockey operations on Thursday, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's vice president/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the news and mentioned that the team will begin the search for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have performed my duties as the Colorado Avalanche's vice president of hockey operations and head coach with enthusiasm, passion and determination", said Roy, 50, in a statement.
I've been thinking long and hard over the summer about how I can improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and the VP of hockey must be fully aligned with the vision of the organisation.
He also needs to be able to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision", Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and wish him well in the future.
Roy was named the recipient of the Jack Adams Award for the league's top coach in his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a Central Division title, but Minnesota knocked Colorado out in the first round of the playoffs and hasn't made the playoffs in the last two years.
The Avalanche's 2015-16 season ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 ties, and the team lost by five points to the Wild, losing the Western Conference Wild Card playoff spot.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups - two with both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
The North Sea oil workers' wage struggles will be postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
Strikes against the Wood Group, an oilfield services company, have been occasionally organised on Royal Dutch Shell-led North Sea drilling rigs.
The Wood Group and Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process to resolve the current dispute, read a joint statement.
We will be holding several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the problems.
According to the unions, their recent labor strike, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut the North Sea contractors' fees by about 9% due to negative market pressures.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the interested parties.
The company said that the additional cuts would give the company the necessary room to move forward in the face of a downturn in the market.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of jobs and announced plans to exit its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it lighten its operations following its massive merger with British energy giant BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with Alliance leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes in the North Sea in a generation.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
'We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, in the North Sea and across the country,' he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to see less than USD 1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, compared to an average of around USD 7 billion over the previous five years.
Kepler measures the rotation of stars in the Pleiades
The latest Kepler mission has helped astronomers to compile the most complete list of the rotation rates of stars in the Pleiades.
The new data will help astronomers to understand why stars in a galaxy rotate at varying speeds and how orbital periods are related to planet formation.
We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we can now learn more about the relationship between the star's mass, its age and even the history of its solar system, said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Pasadena Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis, in a press release.
The Pleiades are a group of stars located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are now reaching maturity.
They're at their peak now.
At their peak velocities, these adult stars are ejecting vast amounts of stellar wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation of each star by tracking the appearance of identifiable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of star rotation rates suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens stars to dancers, the bigger ones doing their decoys slower than the smaller ones.
In the ballet of the Pleiades, we see that the slowest rotors are generally more massive, while the fastest rotors are usually very light stars, Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades are so close, it's an ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the properties of stars at their rotational velocities.
The Pleiades constellation provides an anchor for theoretical models of the rotation of stars that cover both younger and older directions, Rebull said.
We still have much to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down and hang their "dancing shoes" on the nail, so to speak.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the Pleiadian rotation rates in three articles soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
