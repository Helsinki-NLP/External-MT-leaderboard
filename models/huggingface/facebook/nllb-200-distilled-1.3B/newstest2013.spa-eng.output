A Republican strategy to thwart Obama's reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, considers the latter a myth and claims that election fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system in part.
Unlike in Canada, the states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And along that same lines, most of the American governments enacted, beginning in 2009, new laws that made it harder to register or vote.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights were introduced in 41 states during 2011.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID, plus proof of U.S. citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on election day and strip citizens with criminal records of their right to vote.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
So the Republican authorities were quick to extend the practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But often the required ID costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states students, the voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use their school's photo ID.
Moreover, those same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they're American citizens.
Those measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers backed in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of the election in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who wanted to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states that favored reducing the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter represented only 13% of the state's voters.
The same thing happened with the Hispanics.
These represent only 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who make up 76% of the electorate, only make up 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vehemently opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
The damage was partially contained.
For example, only 16 of 34 states passed legislation requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to say for sure whether these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will undermine the American democratic system in part.
Prostate Cancer Screening - Should You Get Tested or Not?
The PSA test sometimes gives erroneous results, with false negative or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant in themselves, doubt whether or not screening should be done.
Do you want to take the test or not?
We've asked two specialists for advice.
Studies in the United States have found a high rate of infection among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
The European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with follow-up at 12 years, also showed that there is a 30 to 40% chance of metastasis if the screening test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend testing from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and there are other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, to offer him all possible options and not necessarily to treat prostate cancers which are not life threatening in the long term, in which case active surveillance of the disease should be opted for.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer are not treated because the cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We increasingly set precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you take the test anyway.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether you should have the test or not.
Movember has developed, in collaboration with the International Urological Society, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, healthy lifestyle habits remain the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate right and got enough exercise, 30 percent of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, the rate would rise to at least 50 percent", says André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that about 10 percent of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally unexplained.
The Canadian Cancer Society considers the fight against smoking a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It is extremely harmful to people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Here's a hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting, your risk of dying from cancer is cut in half.
The weight
Obesity and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon, rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer", they add.
Food
The agency also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
In large quantities, they increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
Junk food should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage cells in the body and lead to cancer", they explain.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their investigations are inconclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly established.
Mr Beaulieu also stresses the importance of discussing family history and concerns with your doctor.
"Doing the screening test does not cause cancer".
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused a great stir last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what's more, it's the particle that the Standard Model predicted would exist -- our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has yet to be empirically observed.
But for physicists it's not entirely clear that it's the Higgs.
We know beyond a doubt that a new particle exists and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data are still missing to be completely certain.
Anyway, we assume it's the Higgs, because the chances of getting it wrong seem low.
There is, in this great world, a general and inescapable law that implies that no two things can be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way you can break that rule and don't try too hard, because you'll end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that it also has a law of this characteristic: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, roughly speaking, of some of their characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other side are the bosons, a filthy gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure at Berkeley Laboratories, which is remarkable, bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we won't talk about here, and "force particles", which are the means by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson is somehow related.
These bosons, I should stress here, are not the exotic bugs we might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily common boson: the photon or "particle of light" that acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment - much like throwing a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing more than a photon; that is, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, except that it's another field, the Higgs field, that needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field, and to activate it you have to reach extremely high energies, kind of like an icy pond where just a thick rock could slide across the surface.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator such as CERN (the large hadron collider is a 27 km ring!) is needed to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to a refrigerator door by itself.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way) don't.
What can all this research 'bring' to the table, asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (SM), and allows physicists to scrutinize differences between observations and predictions of the MS.
Many, in turn, eagerly look forward to meeting, for the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that will fill certain gaps in the model.
This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, such as not proposing any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the Universe (another ups!).
But we haven't found such differences at CERN so far.
The impact
The impact of such research on our daily lives is difficult to predict, but we do not think we are wrong to say that it will have none.
So, you see, in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the laboratories had no idea what a revolution their work would bring.
They saw the scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, said, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory device".
Can you imagine?
And furthermore, applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light detector in 1969 during his research into optics.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this sensor now serves as the "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, earning him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That's not to say, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die is to...
In its Dying with Dignity Commission, Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon while a bill is being prepared.
But within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to get a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year reprieve.
"I had been given five years to live, but I've been here seven", he says, making a pass, lying in bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care centre in Beloeil, which he arrived to the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this", he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him - a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating by himself.
Sitting in front of a tasty lunch, he resignedly accepts help to eat.
Courageous, he even smiles, talks to strangers who pay attention, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of my diarrhea, it is humiliating", she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that disease.
"We learn in our lives that a man peees standing up", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Centre.
Going back to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression", he says.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the big moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All the patients who come into Victor-Gadbois hospice have cancer.
They have a life expectancy of three months at most.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide "healing" care.
Mrs. A., 89,'s greatest fear is to die "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has made him discover his children.
"I have good children", he adds.
"I have no more desires left in this life", she says, before agreeing to be put on a mask to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the next few days, a final visit from his son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with nutrition.
It's palliative care that's given when there's nothing else you can do.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec, we have one palliative care bed for every 11,700 people.
It's very little, since we all know that we're all going to die one day.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether it's physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, depending on the demand.
Diabetics no longer have their blood sugar controlled.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, your son finished his beer at the dead man's feet.
"We help both patients and their loved ones", says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois Centre, the days never get the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man enjoying his last family reunion in the yard, nicely placed between his pillows as everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife and two children, after trying everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 with cancer", worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent centre come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, care designed to ease suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of life, whether at home, in a hospital, or in a care facility.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Palliative Home Care Society of Greater Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this relative lack of health care in Quebec that makes many palliative care doctors fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminent palliative care professionals, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not competent enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently", he relates, "I saw a patient spend 14 days in the ER in excruciating pain without any relief.
I fear that patients will want to die just because they don't get proper care".
And at the same time, many oncologists are stubborn with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's hopes of survival were already at their lowest when she left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she said that she was very sad that I wanted to stop fighting", she relates.
"But she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of patients who request to die thank their caregivers for not having attended to their claims once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of hospice care in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which is used to put the patient to sleep until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease is going to have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia", but "I want to be relieved".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale property scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and specialists in the Italian mafia tell us, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system" that includes the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
An industry that has been too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's funny how the system is pulverized once we've hunted down the big media", quipped Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by a thorough investigation into embezzlement linked to Quebec's road contracts, which the then Liberal prime minister, Jean Charest, had consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
"Since the inquiry began in 2010, the transport ministry alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts", containing some of its instincts to keep a proportionate share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, while hoping to "demonstrate the existing stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also applies with its team of government interveners, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of "la squadre Marteau", who, since 2009, have made the Montreal "sewer cartel" moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has been conducting a series of fraud and corruption charges against municipal officials including Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
He is suspected of repeatedly taking bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have been brought against Montreal road network engineers and Italian-born businessmen, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter caused a stir when he explained to the committee the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to right and left during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the ruling Liberals.
He also admitted to organising an illegal fund-raiser for former Liberal deputy prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former civil engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and bribes from construction companies totaling $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs inflated.
Other road officials have admitted that they received money for inflating bills by 30% to 40% as a result of false extras.
In addition, an organizer for the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filling his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she opposed the sale of a municipal land acquired for 5 million dollars and sold for 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of the campaign money was dirty money.
Of the research that will eventually be done, she says she is pulling "a thread to understand the workings of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the culprits".
He adds that the process is "painful, but positive".
We're cleaning up the wounds but it would take a clean investigation unit in Montreal and being very vigilant so that the questionable practices don't happen again.
How to clean.
I do it regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "elected politicians who are aware of the ploy".
Estimating the proportion of dirty money that went to campaign finance in Quebec at 70%, he ironically says: "I've been told that's just a pale reflection of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that won't change the donation, according to him, "as long as the electoral expenses aren't strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics".
He called for a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "we cannot fall lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws".
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that breakthrough?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Big players are here.
I'm moving forward day by day by his side.
The technical staff has also contributed a lot.
And those elements push me daily to raise the bar of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything goes too fast in football.
But I'm not getting hot.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always made great strides.
He's going to benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They know that every training is crucial.
It makes a player like me want to fight and give it everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti has given me a lot of input in terms of my positioning.
He's backed by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
- Of course I did.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all the coaches.
Today, there is no one like him in Ligue 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a wealth of experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with some great players.
I think he'll take other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think of PSG in the first part of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken our leader's position.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we've qualified for the quarter-finals in style.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We're gonna try to get as far away as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want to start by finishing first in our league against Porto to get the round of 16 final.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You've got the budget.
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and stay there long term.
Today, that's not the case.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the aid is granted in accordance with the principle of sound financial management.
Not winning the cup in Ligue 1, like last season, would constitute a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we're going to invest all our efforts in taking that championship title.
Last season we didn't get very far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finish with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
I think this year will be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It's only natural that they expect a lot from us if you think about what's been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we beat Troyes 4-0 at home, that they still find things to blame us on is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to start a game project.
A team builds over time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, have failed to qualify for the last eight, and they too have invested a lot!
Given the sums invested, we'd imagine you'd have a 15-point advantage on the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not doing well last season, have been "boosted" by this new PSG.
That proves that League One is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Let's just say we have a "Zlatanddependency".
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and scores a lot of goals.
He's here to prove he's the star of League One.
And he's proven in every team he's been on that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What you've done is truly exceptional.
It pushes the others to raise their game level.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things in there and I came out reinforced.
Today I managed to play good matches in the national team.
It's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We have learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and that is why we are behaving in an exemplary way today.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first month in charge of the Blues?
It's getting results.
They're well placed in the World Cup qualifying group.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc has achieved his goal of qualifying us for the European Cup.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the national team to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) on 16 October in Spain lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for all.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never played a game like this in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
This is in contrast to current monetary exchanges, which are based on central banks, identified transactions and processing burdens between parties.
Moreover, as is often the case in technology, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows for peer-to-peer file sharing.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded from 15,000 computers in the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The bitcoin price, after reaching a high of $30 in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to around $10 today (the prices are counted on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not impressive when compared with global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) became interested in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as "credits", used to advance a video game and which can be earned by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange, a central authority controls and handles the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are at once bookkeepers, verifiers, coin issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is signed electronically via a double-key encryption system.
The network can then verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes in bitcoins are recorded in the public ledger, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that ledger.
It involves solving a mathematical challenge thrown at computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
It is a file-shredding phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter, unique numerical footprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "slicing" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular trace (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it's the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, as both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is split in half regularly, most likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by one hundredmillionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
Life on the net has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been hacked and bitcoins in storage have been stolen.
"The fault used does not affect the same protocol", says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Big players like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, the "giant sales" were launched.
"$30,000 was changed", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on the currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology in addition to the transaction network.
Their system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They simply provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to revise hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to gain traction, but in 2013 there could be a change", he predicts.
The ECB also plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, if the currency succeeds.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks join their cause.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, these will no longer be as the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the top of the almond-planted hills thanks to French credits, was by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul unharmed, watched over by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx into Kabul after the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
His taking over the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, taking over government land to sell it as land for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting alongside huge US outsourcing contracts.
They're discredited; most of them haven't fought.
People, I hear in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as do those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They've lived the modern world in exile in Iran or Pakistan and appreciated its advantages.
With about 65% of its population under 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
We must give work to those young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is hungry for mobile phones.Turkish television and its brochures presenting a modern world have huge fans throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are now concerned with rebuilding the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains and strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain degree of decentralisation in the image of Western nations, but the United States has sought to transform it into a centralised state with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister which had existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly in view of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has been restored, no reservoirs have been repaired, and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take them over.
Without energy to extract the iron or copper ores from the ground and without transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the province's most important employers.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to re-establish normal relations.
The French troops left on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: schools for girls, schools for boys, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a "civil and military actions" service of the Ministry of Defence (CIMIC), suppressed in 2012, brought and had brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain localities.
These works, which were lucrative for local labor, have helped to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cropland.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military expenditure?
A rather modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at altitudes of over 2,000 metres.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
To free them from the insurgency carried out by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me they want, they would need to maintain a small civilian aid, well controlled and directly reaching them.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
He's a new double or nothing for President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Only a week ago the Head of State gave the Assembly two months to finish its work.
And for almost two years now, Egypt has been using a provisional text, amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial turmoil.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delusion" and continues to "betray his word" and "trample on the law".
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
A referendum should be held within the next 15 days.
A very short time that forced the Brethren to abandon their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy is wreaking havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote for him, as he claimed in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that the appeal was voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either vote my text or I keep the full powers", powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, the vast majority of whom are Islamists, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the liberals didn't go to the call.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people were added yesterday morning, substitute members, in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the votes were unanimous.
The commentators are amused, moreover, by the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically at prayer time, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent Assembly's clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the object of all eyes, remains ultimately identical to the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the principal source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "norms", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than a publicity stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egyptologist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy".
The fears of the liberals are further heightened by the fact that the next rector of the university would be considerably less moderate than the current one.
"At this time, there is no specific religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulama but university students, some of them trained in the French system", explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity about Article 220, since the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
"We are referring specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are civil judges competent to rule above all this".
The text voted yesterday has received much criticism, apart from its religious character, for the extensive powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few in number compared to those who were under the previous regime.
Another point of contention: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as called for by human rights associations.
The Commission has also expressed its concerns about the text, which it considers liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy remains and insults are henceforth prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
Moreover, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
The only positive thing, she said, was the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was scheduled to appear on television last night, demonstrations are expected this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comforts and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why one should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
The Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized, is worth a visit.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptism pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming a storm and filling nets.
It was at this same place that Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins at the Fortress of Anthony, the Praetorium, where the trial was held, and continues through the streets of the Old City, going to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of Unction and the place of Jesus' burial.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the spot where, according to Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site for Jews, the Western Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will then come true.
Take a vertical trip
The ruins of Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge from enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located on mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there on their own, only those who are dedicated to climbing can.
The rest of you can reach this historic summit by funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
Bus services run from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, the mountain was supposed to be the abode of pagan gods.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You won't be able to visit them all in one trip.
But at least five of them are worth visiting, the most interesting ones.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It contains the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in caves in the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is worth a visit.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha Museum-Bath, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea, you can visit the exclusive private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are strictly not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it and you're in complete darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children ring out and the names of the countries where they lost their lives.
Ukraine is mentioned as well.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of these has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums, and oceanographic museums.
It is interesting that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop below 70 degrees Fahrenheit [21°C] and the air warms up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit [23°C].
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathing is done there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: at 417 meters below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily holds even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to undergo courses of saltwater, brine, and mud therapy to fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
They are preserved in the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It was the famous sea route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll along the narrow streets named after the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street with your "own" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlyweds who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk around the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the chief city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera performances.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
Money for this trip is not recommended in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekeli (currently 1-3$,8 shekeli).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Traveling by any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transshipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed and public transportation is disrupted.
But Sunday morning is the start of a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of beef and lamb dishes, soups and desserts made with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a variety of sauces, falafel, which are balls of ground chickpeas, fruits and vegetables.
You don't see stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats who "walk about at their leisure" in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Phunters love crowded places and don't turn down candy.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) a day.
Plus the insurance, which comes out at $15 a day.
And the rent of a bicycle will be 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets are on average 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to visit the country and rest were citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land was visited by 118,800 Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, a 51% increase on the same period in 2010, before the visa regime was abolished on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for language
While MPs and human rights defenders debate the consequences of the law on compulsory examination, fraudsters who trade in "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed home.
From 1 December a law comes into force, according to which every migrant worker must take an exam to check his knowledge of Russian.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, in time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to pass the language exam, but also the Russian history and the fundamentals of legislation.
Language skills must also be confirmed for the purpose of obtaining and renewing a work permit.
The exception is citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
The law does not apply to persons who obtained their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Usefulness, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centres will be operated under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to come to the tests in all cities, right now in Russia there are more than 160 such centers open.
The initiative to introduce the exam was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights advocates, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: What will this really do?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, the immigration service replies, this will reduce the number of people who suffer "labor slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federal Immigration Service's representation in Tajikistan.
The defence of your rights must begin before you leave.
Only an organised selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are with immigrants without a profession, without education, without language skills and without medical examination.
Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be condemned to encounter unscrupulous people who, under the guise of helping, put him on a "paid trip" to a creepy, narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or papers, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We've had countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they are promised something, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised salaries", confirms the Head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of Tajikistan's Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get mad, little chief!
Meanwhile, however, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia admit that they not only do not know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also have difficulty writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as their own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive a normal primary education.
This is because their families have nothing to feed their children, let alone clothe, shoe, and buy them school supplies.
When they reach their teens, these kids venture into work at the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize you.
"You feel humiliated and inferior".
However, when it comes to the language law, rights advocates point out an important point.
The examinations will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they don't have that status, there won't be any exams and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or no strangers allowed"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be made quickly and for only 1,500 rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and extortion cases appear.
"They ask us for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea", Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the language law's entry into force, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be forged.
Several "fake" certificates of language proficiency have already been seized by Federal Immigration Service officials.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they did not reach the new owners as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, converge government officials and rights advocates.
So far, the authorities can promise migrant workers who failed the test the first time more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian-speaking immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered guns is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: Shotgunning during wedding celebrations where luckily there were no casualties, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which Shotgunning seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry a weapon, from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the law on weapons possession will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying "hard-line politics".
An open letter has appeared online, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such "senseless rigor" measures be abandoned.
The percentage of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov told the BBC's Russia news service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during the first six months of 2012 142 crimes involving the use of firearms were registered in the Interior, compared to 1168 crimes registered in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation on civilian weapons will not hinder criminals from entering the black market.
Now, according to him, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior claims that the situation of illegal weapons proliferation is under control.
Suppliers: From factories to officials
The black market for arms is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts gun orders
The first, "army or military relics", i.e. weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves", says Baranets.
The next type of "black weapon", the ones stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police stores and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are sold from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were set deliberately to cover up the fault", says a former military man.
According to Baranets, the arms manufacturers also put their sand in.
"Private arms factories that are not competitive on the international market and that distribute arms on the black market, including in Moscow, have now proliferated", says the expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A lot of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"They have their own production there, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons", explains the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of illegal arms supply to the black market.
A report on this topic was produced in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Planning in Public Management.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminological literature and publicly accessible data from portals that revolve around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market arms have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons", the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The clerk at one of the gun shops, who asked not to be named, says the guns found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers head to military warehouses when they need a shipment.
Through some ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
They take her off the register and they run her over the fence.
"This one takes the gun into town and sells it for 900 euros a unit with two magazines", he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be fulfilled, they make test purchases from the dealers of illegal weapons", adds the employee.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy proposed that I go to the platform "Begovaya", where there would be a man who would take me to a "corner" where we could negotiate.
I only found out about the price of the gun there".
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"I need a friend with connections to get a gun", says the store clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much".
There are vendors in the markets, but you have to go there too, say "from Mr Ivanovich, who asked me to tell you that his daughter had a tooth fall out".
I can even get a pair of steel cuffs through someone I trust.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I won't rat on him.
Newbies look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets was put to the test as an illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s when he was about to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album that didn't have "everything".
"I felt like I was in a luxury boutique", recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered cat for hare: everything is tasty.
I, as a potential customer, don't just buy; we go with the seller to the woods, where we put a target.
"I get a chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun fires well, we start negotiating", the expert describes the procedure.
Shop for sofas
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money", the headline of the advertisement says, "Buy a pistol or a machine gun".
Users place their orders and ask questions.
And you sell to minors?

I've heard about these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are ordering.
The buyer pays through an ATM.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the gun is hidden", says Dmitri Kislov, press secretary for the NGO Right to Bear Arms.

Makarov for a hundred bucks.
In the purchase of illegal firearms, experts say, one can spend from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "Right to Guns", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300 dollars.

It's sent from the military warehouses by the middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7,8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers are on strike in the US.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has erupted in the United States over low wages at Walmart supermarkets and popular fast-food chains, such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's, and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment no one dares to say whether or not this wave will reach nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and tame itself in its first stages.
The protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the modest wage increases for Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests are aiming to create labor unions at these companies.
So far, this sector of the economy has been practically unoccupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday", when the United States was in the midst of a racing orgy that captured millions of people, sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers at Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, quit their jobs and piqued alongside unions and leftist activists at the company's stores, whose products target people with modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That's why so many low-paid Walmart workers only shop at work.
The availability and variety of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand-held scanners.
That "Black Friday" the demonstrators demanded a pay rise and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who earns $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the median wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
That's about 1.1% more than you spend on salaries now.
If Walmart puts the pay rise on the shoulders of consumers, every visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters are pleased that the protest took place in only nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
"Black Friday" lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
Company representative Dan Fogelman stated in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees quit their jobs and that the protest was "just another PR stunt", organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, with the targets not being Walmart department stores (which this progressive city doesn't appreciate, which is why there aren't any at the moment), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then they don't even give you sick leave and pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, under federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, the average worker in New York gets $8.90 an hour.
Nobody makes less than them in this town.
How you can survive in New York with that kind of money is something I can't understand.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers would stop by McDonald's and work there, behind the counter, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as their main source of income or planned to stay there long.
Now, I constantly stumble across some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live off this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, a commentary in the Wall Street Journal magazine says that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks start being paid at least $15 an hour, or double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be set up in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from denying this right and punishing union activists with ruse and firing.
Moreover, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to embrace the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is excessive staff turnover.
Disagree
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action came in the middle of a rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democratic politicians, most notably City Councilmember Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it's selling billions of servings, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work".
The protesters were backed by other prominent New York Democrats, such as New York City Mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said "we must support fast food workers to get the fair wages and economic prosperity every New Yorker deserves".
As described in The New York Times, this has been the largest such demonstration in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not all of them even fast food employees, which employs tens of thousands of New Yorkers.
It is not yet clear whether this will spark a mass movement.
"For now, fooling the brain is not so easy".
The topic of augmented reality, so popular among modern technology enthusiasts, is lately normally perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
In early summer, at its annual conference, Google demonstrated a moving model and later in November, it became known that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, a conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, revealed that for the company's scientists, glasses were already a thing of the past.
They are attracted to the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group?
- We're dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we also try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
For now humanity in its mass has been stuck in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with your finger.
But we want to look five to 10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
- Even though Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We're trying to change that, we're working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
We must free the world from the computer to ours, to the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those stupid VR headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they're overestimating it?
- Of course you can't consider it a panacea, it's pending to resolve the issue of privacy, since you don't always want others to know about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for controlling devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, gestures were captured not by the device's camera but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
It's pretty big for now, but in theory it can be scaled down to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- What's that? - What?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can of soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at this time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we're going to have to work primarily on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine a person's reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, because they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Do you lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But the question is not megapixels, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on the Z axes.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and current at 30 fps is really sparse, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
I would find it very useful for my work to have an equivalent of such a device, but one that does not require contact to make frames per second more.
- And don't we need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually the infrared emitter and the second the reflected signal receiver.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible tuning fork.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the camera's position curve and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not introduced its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that, from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding a smartphone high in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to a smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that's their strength (private things only you can see), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses won't allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in mid-air is available not only to Tony Stark from the movie "Iron Man", but also to any mere mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
The hands feel nothing!
What responses does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is using the second hand as a support for the image.
It records touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really geared to bring tangibleness to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is, gives a sensation similar to what you feel if someone is blowing on your fingertips, but that sensation is still very weak.
There are also wristbands that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, which is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think that he feels what he seems to feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open, almost endless space.
For now, fooling the brain is not so easy, it still has many years to work.
That's what makes working with virtual reality so attractive to researchers, that a lot of things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt is continuing the project "St. Petersburg Vanguardism", dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront of art and culture.
This list of the best includes brilliant figures from the St. Petersburg art and scene, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
Everyone in town knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and opening ceremonies.
Kirill Miller's paintings always draw crowds wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-garde of St. Petersburg in the late 80s - early 90s.
He is also an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city brings smiles to the inhabitants and lifts everyone's spirits.
Recently, he took up an organ and became the organist of St. Petersburg, having matured to make such a difficult paper, for his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red because I'm a fashion designer and I'm all about appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the image creators and society.
Although in society, anything that isn't a little gray elicits aggression and a stir of unwelcome properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that was my path.
By then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free ones like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with the later ones who were exhibiting in Gaza and Nevsky, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was over.
I got into the theater for the clothes, the music of all kinds, but not for the lyrics.
And all this came together in your Art Clinic... it was important to me to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were supposed to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical art club, a bohemian club, the home of St. Petersburg bohemians.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh's Ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonograph, wore tight pants, among them was the now-fashioned composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was a host of many shows before Hali-galivskih's times.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of her great career; she received her basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Griboyedov Club, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and regular customers went.
I'm a hero from the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the poll was done in the press, the prize was "The people of our city".
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity go separate.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them the current and the occurrence are clearly expressed.
I'm doing a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being that way is painful and scary.
But in clowns, everything gets muddy and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothes.
Now you're followed by your clothes, oriented in the outer, but not in the inner person.
And, maybe that person shouldn't even be shaken in the hand, but spit in the face.
And the deception will be removed when you change your clothes.
- We saw you recently in the role of urban organist.
Who better than me to be!
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful.
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
People used to gather in herds, bohemians wanted one thing, simpletons another.
Now everyone's split into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to be liked by everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov they come by the thousands!
- The abandoned ones are going to see it, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And a cultural event has 300 people coming, 10,000 never coming, so less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to cheat them, not to ruin what you've achieved.
When I was young, I made such pictures that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which is usually where people end up.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, denied money just to paint pictures.
I'm all for this culture.
- Kirill, what is missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: cultural official.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were the right ones, everything was different, the kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they're locked up, because they need experts at a higher level to properly evaluate these and pave the way for them.
Now subjective personal taste is thriving.
Same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, but Moscow is much more cultural, there is land there.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe, there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a killer asteroid strike.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board set off in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How do we continue the species in zero gravity or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars", says the chief researcher at the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
It can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with flora began to be addressed.
It's been half a century since experiments were done on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit differed in nothing from the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, the Drosophila.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to test how the embryo develops in weightless conditions.
We get a normal chicken as a result.
But then the trouble starts.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, stand on its own two feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they found no support, the chicks flipped around randomly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete loss of instinct.
The chicks didn't react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we got the chicks to come out, but then we stopped because it was impossible to work there with them", comments Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a biological miniarch flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, only species of the same sex will travel on the Bion biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely on biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this need to be done", comments Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a proper emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling in space for 50 years now.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question", says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just one year after the space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in outer space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, counting the astronauts who after long flights have all worked out for them, and a healthy generation is growing up.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights", sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
But humanity must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in creating artificial gravity.
The Hydrolab of the Cosmonaut Training Centre is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
In conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, though still hostile environment, for a newborn child it is its native element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm that life on land emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is in the mother's body for about nine months in the amniotic fluid, for it will be easier for the baby to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little to forget", says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming instructor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravity, the force of gravity, is necessary.
In weightlessness the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrease very quickly, the ability of the fetus to expel is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, relying on the action of birth stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it will push you.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress in a special training suit, like adults.
It will simply deprive him of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment we are going to do together, by allowing a child to be born in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally unfit person", predicts Igor Pestov, head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical matter.
However, in time this will become a reality, when humans in their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
NKÚ chief: Inspection of "švarc" system has not found the guilty politician
The Czech Republic has good public procurement inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is lagging.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect", but its application must be correct. "This is what I think we are lacking", he describes the current situation.
The joint inspections by the Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of a wrong practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors.
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the office from acting that has the obligation to perform those controls or demand obligations", Kala says.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Congress of Deputies you spoke of the joint project between the Czech and German teams, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What is it exactly?
This is a parallel monitoring that we started doing about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, followed by national legislation and then the practice itself.
We have put everything together and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to introduce ever stricter rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think are the conclusions?
It is precisely this kind of common control that could help us to stop investing in the efforts to make laws more concrete, to reduce and improve the limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting a suitable thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But the fact that we are reducing the limit on the number of awards does not mean that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much paperwork, those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You speak of the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized differently?
As far as the offices are concerned, such as the NSC, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with a similar organization to ours, with a college too, only that in this case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices are evolving in parallel.
The powers are also somewhat similar, but while Germany has a federal organisation, the audit courts are even at this level.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control federal money, what we here call state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the regions and municipalities, are controlled in Germany by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for the local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not normally like to make a comparison without specific data, but Germany is still a model in some respects, but it is not possible to say exactly which is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of inspectors?
I'm sure not, but, again, I don't like to make these kinds of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries which we take as models have to face a large number of problems.
If it wasn't, you wouldn't have any benefit from working with our office, would you?
As far as the legislation of our country is concerned, what did the amendment to the law on public procurement mean for your Office?
Given the relatively short period of validity of this amendment, it has not yet been implemented in the control procedures.
Since we carry out ex post checks, we must expect a certain delay.
The Commission has already started a new tool for the detection of non-economic risks, which has been used to screen almost 14 000 public tenders, and which will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are changed, the conditions for some types of selection process are rectified and the like.
Do you consider that the passing of this law is beneficial or rather a tangle for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it is.
The problem that can arise is that the regulations "get harsher" and it becomes impossible to comply with them.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to control were already linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and any law on public procurement not respected was a breach of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to tighten the law this way?
I don't think it's like this.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no impact on decision-making.
A system of this kind will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this path we've started takes us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDG would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, referring to being self-employed only on paper.
Is the "Svarc" system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the Office from acting which has the obligation to carry out such controls and to demand obligations.
You can say, "We changed the law and allowed it", but you can't say we'll do it like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict as to how it should be done formally.
But on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct.
The roads are covered with ice, although most of them are passable
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads are covered with ice and snow.
Although most roads are passable, some require extreme caution.
Region of Karlovy Vary
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but presented ice and snow sheets.
The temperature will drop to between five and ten degrees below zero, and the thermometers will rise slightly during the day.
The region has stopped snowing and the lowlands are thinly snowed.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Metallic Mountains, snow reaches almost 12 inches [30 cm].
In some places visibility was still poor because of the fog, according to information from the regional road operations control center.
The R6 motorway and the first category road in the region are now free to move around.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
All second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, some of these still have patches of ice and snow.
We need to increase road safety, especially at higher elevations.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
Some roads in eastern Bohemia are in danger of frost and in higher areas and mountains a snow cover may have formed on the tracks, reports the Road Administration.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger of ice sheets, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frost may occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on second and third category roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
Snow is especially heavy on the roads from the Krkonoše mountains to Orlické hory.
There is a thick layer of snow on the highest parts of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemian area, the sky will be clear and partially cloudy today, with no rain.
Temperatures will generally range between three below zero and one degree positive, with a slight wind blowing.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region are clear this morning, although extreme caution will be required and weather will need to be adapted.
In the early morning, it's freezing, temperatures will be between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads may also be covered with ice.
Drivers will encounter fog in some places, but visibility will improve gradually.
This is according to information from the regional road operations control centre.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the route between kilometres 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road bordering Germany, there may be ice sheets.
The second and third category roads are wet, so in this case, sections with ice sheets are also warned.
Drivers should be more careful, especially on the less busy roads in the Šumava area.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers heading to the higher areas of the Olomouc region will find partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in Červenohorské harbour and on the track towards Videlský kříž.
Road operators removed the snow overnight; about three centimetres of snow accumulated on Šumper road, according to the road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are free to use.
"In the higher parts of the Šumper road, there are snow tracks.
Drivers in Červenohorské harbour will find half of the snow in the direction of Jeseník", an operator from Šumper's road administration confirmed to ČTK today.
On the ground and at night, her colleagues also went to Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the slopes in the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are free of restrictions, on the Šternberská road drivers should drive with caution on forest sections where the roads are still wet.
Region Ústí nad Labem and region Liberec
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications on several sections in the early hours of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are kept below zero even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road.
No service complications have been reported so far.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night, with rain and snow melting during the day and clear skies and ice at night.
General roads have announced unfavourable conditions on the I/13 road, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by tree branches that had arched over the track under the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
They say the world will end in a little less than a month, what do you think?
It's just one of many other alarmist news stories we like to cling to.
The Tap Tap band likes to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only band in the world that can muster enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it.
In December, you're organizing a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain that to our readers?
This is a state benefit we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that the end of the Mayan calendar had for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, December 20 at 9 pm, we will be holding 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Whose idea was this?
It was my idea at first, then we went on to forge the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
To mark the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, T-shirts, bags and original doomsday keys that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anti-doomsday anthem, titled "End of the World, Cancelled".
It's currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear it at the benefit concerts?
Of course I do, and it'll be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time in all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked together simultaneously thanks to a special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics to this song and plays the lead role of Jesus in the music video, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We even work together with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...
We put all our efforts into this project.
Most of them have shown interest and enjoyment in working with us.
What will the money raised from the doomsday concerts be used for?
To equip the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, which we are completing for the sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
Students at Jedličkův ústav school are regularly visited by teachers with whom they have fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make this possible.
As part of the completion of the works at Jedličkův ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is appealing to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform.
For more information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "spectacular action" planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I, personally, taking advantage of being in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have performed for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, the chairs have to travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, we have managed to do well so far.
Even in Moscow, where we just returned from, everything went smoothly.
Excursions abroad allow you to compare different attitudes towards disabled people and other aspects of society.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have seen that there is still a long way to go in the East.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still rare for a person to travel alone through the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as, say, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, it's not there.
Fortunately, a civil association has been set up to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what ways should we follow the example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we are behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is quite normal for people with severe disabilities to move about on their own in public and can go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate in social life in an active way, in this respect, with The Tap Tap we are a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, everything will start to change for real.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap is very popular right now, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličkův ústav, where I had many young people around me who wanted to devote themselves to something.
And since I'm a musician, I play, among other things, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a coworker.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand. (Laughter)
However, popularity did not come until recent years, am I wrong?
It's true that connecting with famous singers and also working actively to promote the group helped us a lot.
We came to the conclusion that work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the European Union's aid, we can afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go this far with The Tap Tap?
I saw the potential from the beginning, that you could do something differently.
The show business is full of things that look alike.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is greeted with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned, suffering beings that we should have compassion for.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop themselves, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it's not just a breakthrough for them, but for the whole society.
Did it help that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand a certain amount of discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds and when they find out they have to come for two days to rehearse, go to the prep test and spend a lot of time traveling and at concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
There's only one, Ladja Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't help it.
Whoever has will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, at Fléda in Brno and at Plynojem in Ostrava and will involve 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via video conference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, canceled"
The aim of the concert is to raise the necessary resources to finance the multifunctional equipment of the barrier-free STUDEO educational centre in Jedličkův ústav in Prague, which costs CZK 25 million.
The concert ticket costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entry in the advance sale option on Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of European Space Agency ministers last week, Poland was accepted as ESA's 12th member, the second ESA member from the former Eastern European bloc after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the following years was involved in the agency's project committee.
However, Poland's journey into the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in spaceflight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, where on 6 December 1933 he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his "Introduction to cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 a dressing room was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and neither are the details of the project.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the dressing or for its braking.
Information about this drezin is limited to the collected in the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to focus on missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki, was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all missile techniques projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the outbreak of war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problemy, the society is first mentioned in four very extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
One of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that space research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
From early 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautics Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA was significantly involved in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) sounding rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket on which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and first launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a peak of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in summer 1959 aerial testing of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a 14.5 km apogee and its mission would be to control high wind.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other by the space available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the available space for the volume was 0.4 litres, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum apogee on the three types was 23 miles.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to 60 km in height.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Suspension of the social work law is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
This means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (wages) produces economic stresses.
This concept is used to describe a situation in which a manufacturer, by importing cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and thereby 'bring down' the price of a competitor in order to gain a larger share of the market and thereby increase its profit margin.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the quality of the information provided by the Member States on the subject of the European Social Fund.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and is therefore not responsible for the unemployment it generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily grows.
This situation has led to the total disinterest of businessmen in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to present specific statistics.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thereby attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population without regard for social decline.
This is particularly evident in changes to existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially as regards wages.
This is done, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of longterm unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees to labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with widening gaps between rich and poor.
For a number of years now, food delivery points have been in operation in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves by their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already one million.
In the context of the increasing competitiveness of the German economy, a fairly frequent case occurs: people employed with a wage so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A similar scandal was made public in connection with the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German Federal Parliament.
The savings measures of virtually all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation: people, pressured by a steep decline in their social status, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live on a poor wage at the edge of society, in the hope that some day private investment capital will come to the country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty is either passed on from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans still work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media are saying to the point of saturation that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that running the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital is defending with its teeth and nails the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
The question then arises whether private capital does not influence the political process and therefore the whole state with its selfishness.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation which manifests itself in the realm of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation which is virtually everywhere reprehensible but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: the state ministries, lacking financial means, commission the drafting of legislation on private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
Such bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
It is obvious that liberal democracies quickly find themselves in a situation like that described by Appianos in his book The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long since disintegrated and the administrations were occupied by force".
In exchange for bribes, illegitimate favors and help financing stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread without any impediment and people went to the polls with the vote palaplaced in advance"... "there were no people of character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to be seriously talked about that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appianos thought of Pompeii, Caesar rose to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today's society is based on unconsidered preferences for individual gain without regard for the common good.
Private capital is not capable, in its essence, of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as back then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, with no effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite is completely ignorant of the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient and more recent history.
Suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution, at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at international and EU level, the Czech government will be forced to continue to seek other ways of reducing the social standard of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution lies in concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose refrain reads "Let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my children did not want wars, there would be none". Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have been, as always, mixed reactions.
One, on the Israeli side, argues for the right of self-defence and labels the Palestinians as terrorists, the other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism by the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and labels Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the periodic killings and who is the victim, because after all, the citizens of today's Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not live through the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the scenes, a look to discover who is profiting from the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached based on my own understanding of the matter, about who or which group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
In the history of mankind the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
In every age we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is not so obvious is whether it was always these characters who steered their steps autonomously or whether there was someone behind their throne who steered their actions toward a particular goal.
We must accept that we live in an age where the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this entails has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don't know, but I don't rule it out): the Rothschilds.
You don't write much around them.
Of course I did.
In the 1990s, they bought the first news agency, Reuters, to stop associating their name with serious criminal acts, because power and wealth, or both, were always there to support them, and that always meant strengthening them.
They have major holdings in almost all the world's central banks and in those countries where they are not represented, war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after Gaddafi was toppled there were only four left, but meanwhile Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild central bank's Bank of America status, began printing money during the Civil War and was assassinated in 1865 at the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their eagerness for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second was aimed at eliminating colonial supremacy, especially of Great Britain, and the third was aimed at reducing the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary to such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method by which the wealthy family group, together with the Rothschilds, operates follows the dynamic of triggering a crisis and then offering a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Council, and I am sure that the Council will be able to take them into account.
So after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francis Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after the resulting First World War broke out, they shattered Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended suddenly and unjustifiably from a military and economic point of view, with the capitulation of Germany (wars to end Tsarist Russia were no longer necessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
To prepare the ground for World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, covertly, a conflict situation following the huge war reparations imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds pushed for the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population there.
Terrorist attacks were happening on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which the international bankers had bound him at first or whether everything he did was part of a plan.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If international bankers succeed in starting it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a frontline victim, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
The European Union must not be seen as a mere political entity, but as a political entity, and not as a political entity, but as a political entity, and not as a political entity, but as a political entity.
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice breed injustice in a never-ending spiral of violence, if at the beginning of it all was the greed of some individuals and their lust for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only put their candidates forward in elections.
The current President of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, is the typical example of a fascist politician loyal to international bankers who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to turn into a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all world oil passes (the shipping corridor is only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 now seen: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order".
The new world order in their imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the wealthy financial aristocracy.
A world where every new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
"And it makes everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that they may not buy or sell unless they have the name of the beast or the number of his name.
You must understand that whoever has two fingers in front of him must add up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six".
If it gets rough, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist student demonstrators occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlavi, who after the revolution fled to the US, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
The American administration saw no positive prospect in the situation: it could not afford to throw the shah overboard, since doing so would jeopardize the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of theocratic rule, was not within his reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later further intensified by the failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the US, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck is an episode of this story, which has been a minor success for America.
Shortly before the embassy was taken, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up at the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, aided by a cover story and a bizarre point: they left with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew examining the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction superproduction.
Combination of genders
The plan that was laid out by exfiltration expert Toni Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the lie seem true, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictitious production company even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film was made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a singular combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example may be the series Ocean's Eleven).
The film combines moods, on the one hand, well-documented scenes from Tehran, and on the other hand, the credits show iconic photographs from the time of the events, which were captured in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are a bit lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the hallways of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the object of ridicule, has become a respected director and his acting has ceased to be the target of sarcastic comments.
Argo is her third feature film, after "Goodbye Little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town.
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old movies above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Tehran is "rolling" in Canada.
The film's best scenes take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy takeover is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of the bewilderment and unpredictability that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the impostor team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story doesn't offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he does quite well, sometimes adding to reality: here, everything doesn't go so smoothly (the scene of the crisis at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the wild search for his lead becomes a madness).
Argo's weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and they are by no means the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of its dramatic trace, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, valuing its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But it collapses, that's going to be hard.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflation
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually publishes a survey on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event that the EU is planning to approve a 40% quota of women in management positions in large European companies", explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey organiser.
Among the absurdities named is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies for men and women.
Until now, women have benefited from better rates in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other amazing ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by people until the end of this year".
The election will take place at the end of February 2013", Nacher reported.
Among the controversial EU regulations are, for example, the mandatory addition of bio-components to fuel which, as a result, damages the environment; another ban on the use of lifetime mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the directives darkening the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The de facto ban on the use of the term 'butter-cream' or the withdrawal of the traditional light bulb from shops has been criticised.
A quality banana should be 14 centimeters long.
The Union apparatus often makes such decisions under pressure from one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are normally defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even under threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
A lobby interest was behind the request, for example, that the highest quality bananas in the EU must be at least 14 centimetres long and must not have 'abnormal curvatures'.
The European Commission defended itself by saying that it was only trying to harmonise national rules which had not been harmonised up to now and which only made marketing more difficult.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the grounds that the existing directive leads to food waste.
The candidate to win the poll could be the US prescription from last year that inflatable balloons that are marketed must warn that children under 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The United States was referring to an American study which showed that balloons are the leading cause of child death by asphyxiation when it comes to toys.
A similar restriction applies to the use of night-stands by children under 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
The European Parliament has also been asked to make a statement on the situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which is now a member of the European Union.
The Bankovnípoplatky.com website, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, named the Union's requirement for the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State among the absurd proposals mentioned above.
The EU has set maximum quantities of food supplies that can be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, which led to a substantial fine.
The survey organisers were also interested in the idea of paying those countries which have no access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for applying for grants.
This kind of ideas did not come from Brussels but from Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation", declared then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that the cereals produced in our country were too large and that, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full stores and had to export them.
According to Palas, the Czech Republic is far from seaports and the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was ready to help the Czech Republic and held a public tender for the purchase of cereals from landlocked countries.
The grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development under Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU) and is intended for the preparation of applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The EU's efforts to regulate and also to make the EU work and develop more effectively are, according to several experts, worthy of our recognition.
The most serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects which have nothing to do with deepening European integration but which the Member States have achieved in budget negotiations.
The Czech people, like other countries in the Union, are also affected by the struggle for the right to designate the origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these battles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the name of origin of the Olomouc wine, but had to change the name of the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became called "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate may be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
The official EU list of protected designations of origin already includes, alongside the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, the German marzipan from Lübeck and the Parma ham, for example, the Karlovy Vary biscuits, the Pohořelice and Třeboň carp and even the Žatec hops variety.
As EU protected mares, they can be proud of the gingerbread from Pardubice and the boats from Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything were fine in our country, then I wouldn't run.
But I can no longer bear to see how the last twenty years have been stealing in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes are raised and the retirement age is raised.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm already 40 and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run for senator or president.
He's already made it to the Senate, but shortly after that he's on his way to the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for you?
I always said my candidacy for president depended on the results of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my focus is not on the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas a reality.
That's why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the TV, but that we trample on anyone who wants to start a change.
Add to this the media, which discredit you and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
I'm accused of bribing journalists or being an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
He's running for president with financial theses and criminal liabilities of politicians and a property declaration over twenty million.
To do that, the law must change.
As president, he has no such authority and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to handle this?
As a citizen, I was part of a lobby group for the job of guide to be recognized as a self-employed job, and we succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether it is from the right or the left, they are deliberately rejected and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have the greatest potential to win the support of all the parliamentary groups.
Without boxing or party dogma, I have the ability to be able to pick something from each party that's best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a man of the right or a man of the left?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we get along.
I don't care if someone is on the right or the left, I want to bring people together.
I am always openly in favour of any good solution, whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the SDG, and I will be equally against bad ideas.
He jokes when people call you a populist.
But isn't that what you're saying?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get close to them.
Some will call it populism, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world or well-known experts are talking about them.
But without the support of Parliament, all he has left are slogans.
And with that, he can't survive in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial liability?
I don't have a choice.
I'm trying to convince politicians, journalists and civil society to get on my side to get it done.
If elected president, I would have no problem organizing a live television broadcast in which I would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there's a strong character that points out the disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Let us take for example the direct election of the president, which was the result of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I'm just getting started in politics and I'm trying to get as much support for my program as possible.
I'm trying to get things going myself, but in case it doesn't work out, in six years I'll quit and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I don't do anything with a person, so I've been visiting a number of well-known personalities, in case they're encouraged to run for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had too much work.
For my part, I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud with light heating oils.
I ran on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did voted for the establishment representatives.
In the Senate, we're two independents.
The people elected the Senate, so it will be difficult to bring about change.
I will, however, defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the impeccable past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have money.
I have no money even for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
You don't have any money?
Speaking of property deeds, what's yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
I have a property in Prague worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment valued at 8 million, a collection of artwork worth 10 million, an Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth a million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my childhood dream, and I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women, and at the same time, fought against evil and injustice.
You drive an Aston Martin, your property is worth $60 million and you have no campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that there is not much interest in my program.
And I'm not obligated to pay for the campaign with my own pocket money.
The campaign expenses essentially cover what I'll receive as a senator's salary.
But I could not live on it. For example, I could not pay for my son's English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run.
So you're going to continue your business activity to make a living?
Didn't you say before that you were quitting this business?
This has nothing to do with a raise.
As promised, I've partly given up my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
People would want it to be the Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I need to make a living, too.
How much do you usually make a month as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep making.
If I was president, then I'd quit the business.

The architectural studio MVRDV shows that true adventures are not just in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "mountain of books"- 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and there is finally something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company near the library, points out: "Besides, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have the Internet, tablets, and e-books.
No one likes to go into those old-fashioned libraries, do they?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy town on the outskirts of Rotterdam hardly worth a quick visit, has the dubious honor of having risen with a record for forgetting.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, some years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture by copying the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was that the policy makers decided that there was only one way to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, of the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, a master of the art of bar diagrams and responsible for both funny and cynical buildings, took the subject with his usual serenity and attended the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked around in perplexity and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books in a pyramidal size and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg".
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is rising in the intended place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of apartment buildings and townhouses.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the small city with no history, which until now had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuit a dairy factory, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a cheese grater.
It is true that there is an elevator that takes us right to the center of this mountain range, but true space and reading lovers do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to see, the recessed brick floor and elegant lanterns unambiguously support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
If you look up, you can see the park benches, the dogs, and the boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"The bookshelves are usually arranged along the front and in the centre there is a huge dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
What we've done is we've turned the classic spatial configuration upside down and taken the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention is made of the black shelves that serve as wall coverings, parapets and railings at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the town of Spijkenisse.
And so one day, on a Frisian farm, we came across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, a plastic fabric of a few millimetres thick has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a base for holding the roots of crops.
It's a cheap and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts for two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library, this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to four-centimeter-thick plates.
With heat and pressure, so-called agricultural plastic (APP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous, durable material that smells like a mix of a new car and a sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain, the reward awaits us. Not only does the café offer a fantastic view of the city, but it also offers delicious Dutch croquettes and their ficus plants in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"While it is hard to believe, given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary ecological project", says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences that line the glass façade provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is the thing with the automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
The booklet was also visited by Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, who described the "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "late soul".
The reason is that, on the occasion of the opening that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
The aim is to fill the gaps in a library which does not yet have a complete archive, currently 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain bond with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV studio has achieved a great success in that dominant discipline which in specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of literary history.
No matter how young and uneducated he may be.
Finally a starting point for your identity.
Szabo: 'Germans must play a more leading role'
Germany abstained in the vote on Palestine's admission.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, this puts Berlin in a rather tricky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany indicated that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status at the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the country's special relationship with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I do not think he supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to prove its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, that's right.
This is because at the moment it is reorienting its foreign policy away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and towards a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to decide what their role will be, but they have already started the road to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain.
What exactly does a 'normal' foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy which, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is strongly motivated by economic policy, that is to say, by exports and by its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and Germany must therefore protect their interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken on the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it must be careful not to alienate itself from Arab public opinion or Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not put too much emphasis on it, since it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position is very well understood.
I therefore believe that there has not been a break as drastic as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has earned some respect for itself.
In the end, all this has only shown that it is a country which is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has been clearly in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
There have always been these disparities because of US domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration is secretly showing a great deal of understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is obvious that the government cannot defend this position in public.
I think the real disparity of opinion is not really as wide as it is being attributed.
If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policies he is developing.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States with the position of its main EU partners?
I think that's precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would of course be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
They therefore have no possibility of being part of a higher entity, but must push things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, if only because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a tricky subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player?
Or do you still find it difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always a bit uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that whenever Germany is positioned as a leading player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
It's an old problem and nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In this way Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
You have to show a receptive attitude to different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The US influence in European politics is declining, but the EU is not filling the void at the moment.
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more leading role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren is too.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China but which has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, this is protected as long as the true names do not file a claim.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be given the reason.
"Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my desk.
The imitators simply add a couple of letters to register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copying in the same way, as happened to the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet where he keeps seats from the Beijing trademark office.
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name also used by the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing on intellectual property rights.
In large cities there are multi-storey department stores dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, the case of Pattloch is different: on behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trade mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to profit from a name already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or companion brand.
The word originates from the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
Chinese authorities feel no guilt
"It is harmful to business, we must fight it", Pattloch demands.
"The brand is losing its monopoly position and the image is being damaged".
The financial losses and legal costs for the sectors concerned are in the millions, especially for iconic luxury goods.
According to data from market research firm CLSA, with a volume of EUR 15 billion a year, China is the third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market.
However, the cancellation of entries in the trademark register which are doubtful of their legality is complicated and expensive.
The processes can take up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court dismissed a lawsuit because so much time had passed that the name being sued had already become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist money because the lawsuit has damaged the plagiarist's brand in China", Pattloch notes.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That is why even today the Chinese can still use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that was very reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to change it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo depicted a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities feel no guilt.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to a shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the work emergency situation returned to normal".
The number of unresolved complaints has thus been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints remain pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money.
As is usually the case in China, the figures are staggering.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trade mark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China is leading the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the trademark office.
This seems to be the case with the number of valid logos, which totalled 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed in rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese copycat.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
The imitator has managed to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"We have brought this situation about ourselves because in Germany surnames are not protected", says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trade mark office also dismissed the Munichers' appeal.
In the two subsequent instances Freudenberg was found to be right, but the opposing side is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the Supreme Court of Justice, where it is still pending.
Wentzler is confident that the matter can be resolved favourably and commends the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review records up to 100 years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "six-figure sum in euros" in order to reach an amicable agreement, but he was unsuccessful.
"This shows how much we care", says Wentzler.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten to affect even Europe.
In the case of the United Kingdom, the Commission has not yet decided whether to grant the exemption.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the Freudenberg name in Germany for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since left this commercial sphere, but it has managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful", says Wentzler.
Both he and Attorney Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what needs to be done is to "register also in China everything that may be susceptible to protection", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the issue may be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, in the event that Freudenberg lost the last round of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license fees for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS day: dance, sing, help
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a bond capable of overcoming far more than 5,800 miles of distance.
First, the dance begins: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high-heeled shoes, and moccasins search the floor for the beat, and they quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor, and soprano) begin to slowly rise, swirling, stuttering, and following one another.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to go almost out of his depths trying to put order into his energetic, gentle gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Also here are the 50 singers, aged 23 to 69, from the human geneticist to the householder.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice in the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS program, there are about 34 million people worldwide infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV positive.
Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them go to high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and will guarantee you a hot meal a day at Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "story-teller" or "panegirist" in Zulu.
No one in this room can speak this Bantu language fluently, but they can sing.
For ten years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language, sometimes transporting them to their place of origin - southern Africa.
At a distance of 5,500 miles [8,733 km] in a straight line from Heidelberg in the northeastern kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large number of them children.
More than 300 are now without parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what is happening in Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision is not well received by the population, and it has been shown to cut the risk of infection in half.
More than 40 percent of Swaziland's population is infected with the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at just over 30 has become common.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw most of all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the most important things: food, clothing and training.
Without a school diploma, the chances in a poor country are more than slim.
At first, it was only the private commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day, all for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STDs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common STDs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Sickle-cell and scabies are among the parasitic STDs.
What are the main groups of people affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis in Germany are caused by sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomoniasis, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it's a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, urinary discomfort, discharge, abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
They often cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore go undetected.
How can one protect oneself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they don't offer 100 percent protection.
Some sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through infections from dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you frequently change sexual partners.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any later consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees the choir charges for its performances throughout Germany, they raise a considerable amount of money.
"In total we have already sent some EUR 200,000 to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini itself, a self-confident and capable woman manages the money sent from Germany.
She makes sure that the orphans find a good place to live, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogo", as elderly women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans to care for, provide them with a roof over their heads, and make sure that the children go to school every day on time and in uniform.
Those who have no one to help them are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, Voices of Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken coop and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has gotten many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is evident throughout the country, it is not usually openly discussed.
A King with 14 Wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality".
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his lavish lifestyle, full of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This form of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also because of the countless temporary workers who travel the country from side to side and who take you where you are going.
According to Annette Lennartz, "free condoms are available on every corner, but they are hardly used.
It's a different culture, they only accept skin-to-skin contact here".
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels every two or three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language; such recognition not only brings a great atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to pull a few tears from a few rabid border soldiers.
The journey always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small town is hardly ever shown on maps, it is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, the light shines there", the locals say.
And after walking the 5,500 miles straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms on Bergheimer Street filled with singers marking the way, you realize that you can also see their light shine from there.
NASA has discovered ice on Mercury .
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, it also contains icy water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that an ice sheet has formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It appears to be at least a foot [30 cm] long and probably up to 65 feet [20 m] thick.
The water probably came from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one links the ice finding to the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger's chief investigator, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to shed light on how water and other components of life got to other parts of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed by the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes, and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images back to Earth: little windows into the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which endless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unromantically named W5 by scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This twisted image of a dying star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the enormous Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are forming from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture of the galactic star-forming zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with a telescope, you can see colors better.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a land continent has earned it the nickname North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in a spectacular color.
This fledgling star was captured in all its glory for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It's probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs ever taken by the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the hues, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the fiery heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carom: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are slamming into each other and colliding.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who dislike technical abbreviations may refer to it by the nickname of the Southern Mill.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles that are between ten and a hundred times smaller than the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays taken by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a time as a model for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone is constantly producing new stars.
In this star cloud, associated with the Rosetta Nebula, new stars are also continually rising, 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there's still no dust, just gas.
Researchers speculate that it formed shortly after the big bang, when hydrogen was found in the universe.
Our window on the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope seems to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown in size and depth.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the picture, was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope is lifted.
This allows us to view the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror on the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The drawback of this cheaper construction is that the telescope has a fixed lift angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed lift angle.
Their peculiarity is their enormous ability to pick up light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 300 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI for its acronym in English) anyone who owns a computer can help, providing processing capacity.
View from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here rises the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 metres and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
It's not expected to be imaged until 2018.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each of them with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
A new telescope of enormous proportions and a mirror diameter of 100 feet [30 m] is planned to be built on Mauna Kea.
This is a picture of what it would be like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes to us from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been sending images from distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light from the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers assume that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury as well.
However, there is no reliable evidence, since the Messenger probe orbits the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is so.
Drink butter every day and live 168 years

There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A trace search in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The ride through the mountainous Talysh region could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus rides through the winding road, passing by wooded hills, flowing rivers, and the simple homes of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, you might even think you're in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, just a few miles from the border with Iran.
Here live the Talyshi, a people about whom little is known, except that they are fluent in Persian and Azerbaijani and are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive a Soviet-era architecture that does not seem to fit in with such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists hardly ever get to this place, as the road from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is too heavy.
The 323 kilometers that separate the two cities take eight hours because the road is one-way.
The astonishing wealth the country enjoys from the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will be holding the World's Oldest People's Festival", Fatulayeva notes.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshi from the area who have passed the age of 100.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
One of his sons died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the sheep herder Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate to prove it.
And if we consider that the oldest man documented lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"She was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973", Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and apparently still had time to conceive another daughter at the age of 136.
Is Şirali Müslümov wrong then in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, Germany, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, there are also very old people", says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men".
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when there is no civil registration either.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a biblical age.
There are 20 people over 100 years old today.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the South?
The Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the talyshis' special genes.
The museum's director, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes the cause lies in the food.
From a nutritional point of view, however, it does not seem logical that the high-calorie diet of the talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom also drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97, he's relatively young for what he's styled for in these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she tirelessly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
Two little children also jump from side to side.
In the kitchen, they prepare tea for the guests, a tea served in typical cups with a bulbous shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief she hides two long braids of dark blonde hair that her son proudly discovers.
I always wash my hair with milk, so it never falls out and keeps its color.
"I have never used shampoo either", says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live on
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been to a supermarket in my life.
So you're telling us about your husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything went back to normal when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird coming from an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan, the cult of the father figure of the nation, who rules his country like a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when he handed over the throne to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly people of Azerbaijan don't know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount that can be lived on well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's gray son is right: "In our culture the elderly are highly respected".
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if that's not enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the phrase "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is plunged.
The future constitution, based on Sharia law, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president has not been sparing in his pathos.
"We must get through the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God", he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, especially to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
All of them, hopelessly mired until now in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost apologizing, he had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his own "to save the revolution".
Yet neither the Egyptians nor the world at large know exactly what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
You intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were forced through a constituent assembly of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour nightly meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What, though, does that mean about "beginnings"?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists will take advantage of this vague wording, as well as the legal leeway it has provided, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what a new article added suggests: in all matters relating to sharia, it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power in all of Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be this way, but it may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, which - in fact - would result in the incapacity of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exert harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were held in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
This is so imprecise in legal terms that the state institutions could even control the content of film and literature with the help of this article.
To be clear, this is nothing but censorship.
I am sure that the Commission will be able to do something about this.
On the other hand, another prohibits insulting or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording that prohibits "offending persons"
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
Interpretation issue, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Morsi for his signature and which, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks now the opposition has been closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to defeat the Act before it could come into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning", says Hamdin Sabbahi, who is third on the presidential election list.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft constitution should be "in the trashcan of history".
Through Twitter he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow him", says oppositionist Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for", opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration, not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer across the Nile, in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and Salafist supporters took part in the protest, shouting: "The people demand the application of divine law".
They demanded that Morsi "clean the country", while at the same time proclaiming: "the Koran is our constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have led to a situation similar to a civil war.
Clearly Morsi's supporters did not want to risk that happening.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that both opponents of the draft constitution and supporters of the same would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would have been the time to let the people decide at the polls which direction the country should take.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamists' draft has a guaranteed majority.
"The term 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious at this forced constitutional process which should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or faced trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him Human Rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression `Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution", he laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three branches of the state caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are a flagrant violation of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it", Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could backfire on you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control".
Norwegian rakfisk: the world's most stinky fish?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has something to do with its craving for a highly smelly fish?
Have a series of overly cured cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the stunning aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The scenery is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is left to ferment in water for, depending on how foul-smelling you prefer, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this most, if not the most captivating delicacy.
"You eat it raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit from a sip", says Havard Halvarsen, the city firefighter who is also known as the "General of the Rakfisk", who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we look, we see people eating this fish that is kept in small buckets and drinking large amounts of the drink in one gulp.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk", says Havard.
Drink can kill the smell.
I'll try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near your nose, it's not bad; it's not much different from a slice of sushi that you've driven a few miles on a bus.
Rakfisk is a product from a very different time, when poverty was rampant in Norway and before refrigeration, fish was kept in water and salt in airtight barrels during the autumn.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is well fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with the senses inactive because of alcohol, eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and they emigrated mainly to the United States.
The population is now growing rapidly; over 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive social services system.
A stream of people from Sweden, the old rival and until recently much richer than Norway, is coming to this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered important, an essential, though rather foul-smelling, part of Norway's past.
It's among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But in fact, everything is expensive. A can of beer or a sandwich costs you a whopping 10 euros ($14) each.
Norway is not usually on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it that way.
Here people are still reluctant to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 incident".
The Norwegians find it very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own would be capable of such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway's current wealth is the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well", says our waitress Anna, as she passes trays of rakfisk, which with its long blond mane and striking blue eyes represents the image of Norwegian prosperity.
"We are, as you say, a prudent people".
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like to flaunt".
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully; all but a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn't have during the years leading up to the worldwide financial crisis, Norway kept their wallets tight.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk", he adds with a laugh.
I'm in the snow waiting in line to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is definitely something different and quite juicy to savour.
But at night, that stinking fish comes back.
The hotel I'm staying at is one of many venues that hold a rakfisk dinner where diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the most testy of the nostrils.
A TV has connected live with a host wearing a birdcage and surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It's like the Eurovision song contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Harvard".
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overcome by aquavit.
Or maybe it's the fumes from all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a rough start
As Mexico's incoming President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant discusses the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad right now.
In a city that is already congested at best, a steel fence has been installed since Monday cutting off several of the main roads leading into the city and causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching the parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
You're facing a complicated task.
Mexico has been making good economic progress under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is mired in a war against drug trafficking that has claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence", Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
"I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal".
Before elbowing the President of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his home state, Mexico.
A highly populated and rapidly growing state, surrounding the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory where he used to move.
A man of integrity
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents credit it with the growth of tourism in the area and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is a huge improvement over the cracked and potholed roads that were rehabilitated.
Plaques bearing his name can also be seen at the entrance to a modern sports complex and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he will be able to bring about real and lasting change", says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a deputy from Mr. Peña Nieto's party, the PRI.
"Particularly in terms of security and economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change our country so badly needs".
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition's characterization of the new president as being lacking in substance.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a fantastic statesman and, above all, a good listener".
However, across the state that's not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden beneath highway sections, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods and violence against women is especially severe.
In a desert plot next to a landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in the last two years alone.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than Ciudad Juarez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, at best, he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
His most vocal critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the decaying neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to hold back tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner killed her.
"When I arrived at her home, it looked as if her body had been cleaned", recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared".
As her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross on which a single word is read: Justice.
However, that's exactly what the family says has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a complainer.
They want you to just take what they say and shut up".
"But that cannot be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect", he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will come with a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make it a priority during his term.
"I hope he is the same kind of president he was when he was governor", says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't report any ill-treatment, according to prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to deal with allegations of abuse by Bradley Manning during his time in prison.
The trial focuses on Manning's time at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the basis that Manning's incarceration was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
Prosecutors sought to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to expose the mistreatment he now alleges he suffered while in military custody.
During the interrogation of Manning by the prosecution at a pretrial hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits by officers from the unit that Manning received during his nine months in custody at Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defense's request that the case be dismissed on the grounds that his imprisonment had been harsh and that it had already resulted in sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide while in custody.
The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while on duty in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after Manning's visits during his arrest at Quantico Military Prison, where he was held in maximum security from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and noted down his answers.
When asked about the forms by Fein on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had described the treatment he received from the guards as "excellent" and the treatment he received at the facility in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns about some issues and that the visiting officers had discussed those issues and indicated that they would be addressed, but that they did not record those issues in the record.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after having spoken about the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problems", Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not reported the treatment she received during the January 2011 meeting with a council tasked with examining suicide intentions she had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime under which he was.
The military said they had put him under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below suicide watch, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine and (wanted) to stop being on injury prevention... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life", Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base at Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he fainted from the heat.
He said that the fact that he wasn't allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to just Camp Arafjon, to that cage", Manning explained Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage".
Manning claimed that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, slippers, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, since it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from outside pointing at his eyes while he slept.
He said if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he made in Thursday's deposition that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of the jail guards and other inmates.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's questioning on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order given him by the janitor that he should drop the blanket he might have covered himself with, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before in an attempt to prove to an officer that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he could have used the rubber band from his underwear or his slippers to injure himself but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take into account his experiences during his time in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted at the court-martial, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to misdemeanors and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules applicable to all detainees in maximum custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegal solicitation of information on the Internet, leaking of national defense information, and theft of public property or records.
If found guilty on all charges, you could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had barely come down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Signs pointed the way to two lines, one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners".
I stood there for a few seconds not sure where I was going.
Having grown up in Central California, all my life I've been called "Mexican".
It's ethnic shorthand, just like my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
Later I decided on "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, shorthand or script was not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I can't shake my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I got in line for foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when the president-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda for the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at this time it is as likely for a Mexican to stay in Mexico as to venture to the United States.
It wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, though he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of rancor.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them of it are everywhere.
So the moment a U.S. official says anything that involves the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how the Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma are on the war footing.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about grudges?
There's a lot of it.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe a father or a mother or one of the grandparents, who was shut out of opportunities in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time, that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, low education, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight of that, the American dream, and not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
We are also aware that many of the Mexican ruling class elite do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulder as if we were of a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in America but still, lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter are bothered by it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel like they're not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we're seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexican.
Now, to complicate matters even more, from what I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as makeshift "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much grudge.
And with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be left alone with this idea, friends.
It's only fair.
If some Mexicans are still not ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful for how their relatives were treated much less recently.
I'm not going to.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new middle east
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may well be an unlikely basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that all hope is in vain.
Amid the useless and habitual arguments over who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; over 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything in pieces whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught in the regional upheaval.
Perhaps this will make their fight even bloodier than before.
However, there is reason to believe that their deadly stalemate could be breaking.
A War Neither Lost Nor Won
At first glance, optimism seems very difficult to justify at present.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 is maintained, this week's fighting has strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has been beaten up.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the most miserable and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to wipe out Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other side of Palestine currently ruled by its ruthless rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a rising regional power that had previously been Israel's closest Muslim ally, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Exultant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hezbollah militia-party dominates, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, didn't have much time for Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is cousin to Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hard-line Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military question is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep better... for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States is more assertive than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have claimed the lives of about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, thanks in part to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of territory aspiring to become a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite being illegal under international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even more hardline group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 elections, is in a good position.
Why spoil those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets like their compatriots have in Gaza?
Better to get them behind that wall and give them a good punch if they raise their heads.
The hard-liners may prevail, though the Arab Spring may alter their calculations.
Although the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere may not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the superpower in the region will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination is creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics are worsening as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to repel Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution is still what sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper are advocating: two states and the ceding of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must start curbing the flow of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs who are not involved should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual statehood category at the UN.
Mr Obama also has an important role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he failed to present his own peace plan.
Back at the White House, he seems just as reluctant to give you his attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The law on tobacco packaging goes into effect in Australia
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and ill-healthy body parts appear on a dull green box, which is the same for all brands of tobacco
Australia's world-first tobacco and generic packaging law comes into force, replacing the logos and brand colors with a pale olive green wrapper, gruesome images of ill body parts and depictions of sick children and babies from smoking parents.
Apart from the various images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, which are mandatory from Saturday, are the brand names, all printed in a small typeface.
It is the most stringent regulation in the world on tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia says that the goal is to discourage youths from smoking by eliminating the traits that make the habit glamorous.
He trusts studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before age 26, there is a 99 percent chance he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand", said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has put enormous pressure on the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would encourage the black market in tobacco, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences", said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring in to sell on the streets of Australia.
Other people say their business has benefited after the law was passed.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for silicone snuff bottles and covers to cover up the nasty images of the cartons had skyrocketed almost from zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a recusal to the law in Australia's Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha claimed that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was expecting more stocks.
"It's a good business for us".
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector targeted by the plan.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most retailers not to display cigarettes, tobacco marketing has moved to online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it to foreign websites.
"If you're a tobacco marketer and you only have this little window to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be", said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in brand reviews from "ordinary citizens" posted on social media websites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry is focusing more on what the new regulations imply than on marketing.
The industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to object to the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to make it mandatory to include images in the box.
They are currently compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia many smokers are defiant.
"Photographs do not affect me.
I just ignore them".
"You take the cigarette and put the pack away", says Victor El Hage as he buys a pack with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I would quit: for my daughter".
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in central Sydney, says that the uniform boxes make it harder for him to put them on the shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to unpack a delivery; now it takes me four", says Yu.
"The government should have banned tobacco altogether and then, there it is, okay, it's over and we close the store", he says as he raises his hands.
In a world that's constantly connected, it's not so bad to get a little bored.
During this year's Thanksgiving holiday, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying in had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you guys.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, like books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention duty-free shops.
But there are more and more academics and child development experts who extol the benefits of boredom.
They say that it is okay for us and our children to get bored from time to time.
Boredom forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we accept boredom in a good mood?
- I know.
And no, you didn't.
But we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" published in 2011 by Yale University Press, says, this is not the case.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very long", he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century AD.
We also need to think about how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in a wide variety of ways", says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing published research and pitching the idea to a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you".
He says the difference between boredom and apathy is that a person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the altered attentional process, associated with a low mood and a sense of slow motion".
Boredom can sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that while they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as an environmental or world issue, whereas people who are depressed view the problem as their own.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what's really happening is we have trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups listened in the next room to a TV program at full volume that had no relationship, others listened at low volume, so that it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not hear the audio at all.
The group who listened to the program at a low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they had trouble concentrating, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, distracted attention can lead to boredom", said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the study's authors.
"On the other hand, when you are doing something boring, such as spotting faulty parts on a production line, distracting music can help you to avoid being bored".
"In fact, we now know that moving or doodling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, because they make that person physically more alert".
"Research shows that children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to be still", says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at times: a delayed plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure this, some researchers developed a "boredom tendency scale" in the 1980's.
The scale includes questions such as "Many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "There are so many things I'm interested in that I don't have time to do them all".
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that by using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more variety.
But, in general, teenagers are a kind of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by searching.
It found that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current rates of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But what she did know, she said, was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest peaks", largely because both children and teens are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, going back to my question from the beginning: Is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, because taken to an extreme, it can expose us to absurd physical risks, such as gambling or addiction to drugs as a method of combating it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this question for more than two decades.
"Boring is your brain's way of telling you that you should be doing something else", says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar or cook, that'll satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So if you give your child an iPad when he's bored, he may not be bored anymore, but he won't have learned to entertain himself or to dose himself", says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dose itself applies to other situations", he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself but also learns to exercise better self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to glorify boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable away from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees with you.
"We think we need to be bored more, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to associate with something worthwhile", he says.
He points out that what people really want is a way to disconnect and enjoy a downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated", he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops".
Colorado: No instruction book for new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community college student and football player in southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal statewide: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one September day, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by police.
The police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor crimes that each carry a fine of 100 US dollars) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
"We are treated like criminals", says Orozco.
And they are?
In the uncertain weeks following the Colorado vote to legalize the possession of small amounts of recreational marijuana, the answer to hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana possession offenses are being overturned both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law goes into effect in the coming weeks.
But Colorado's more conservative district attorneys have committed to moving forward with open marijuana possession cases and are still subpoenaing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the west, are voting to ban the opening of newly licensed marijuana shops in their communities.
"All of this is changing so quickly that I don't know what's next", said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington state are also turning the tables on the matter.
And they are still seeking advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licensing, all before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide", says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent to follow", he says.
The Washington law, called I-502, goes into effect on December 6, leaving one year for swimming between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to balance the state's requirement to provide "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with its prohibition on conducting cannabis businesses within a 300-meter radius of schools, parks, playgrounds or daycare centers.
"Nowhere will it be harder to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates emailed his police officers informing them that the city prosecutor would stop filing lawsuits for misdemeanor possession of marijuana against people over 21 and that police would stop filing charges against those offenses "with immediate effect".
Police Chief Oates said they would enforce the city's regulations regulating marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to hunt down drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers to decide to get treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those misdemeanors that at the time they occurred were a crime", Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Grand Junction police, the county's largest city, no longer subpoena adults for small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
"I don't consider that I'm wasting my time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes", he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing recreational marijuana use into the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The conflicting reactions emerging throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
"It's a cultural barrier with the district attorneys", says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana possession defendants and who is a local spokesman for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
"They have spent so much time taking people to court that, in reality, they still can't accept that it's legal", he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become national test cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials are counting on a new frontier of legal sales, they are also eager to receive guidance from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of marijuana sale and cultivation as federal crimes.
Proponents of legalizing marijuana are hoping the Justice Department will back down.
Although there have been some notable arrests of patients and dealers of medical marijuana, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana-selling businesses to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"While drug agents are unlikely to break down doors to seize a small bag of drugs, they are likely to be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of recreational marijuana, as permitted under the new law", said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration drug policy adviser.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
"We don't want to get into a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level", explained city councilman Bob Nicholson.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We're studying what the community voted for versus voting for what the state voted for".
Many questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed to the point of being kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory"
You don't attack college students for their views just now.
I can't remember a time in my life when I wasn't dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been to what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980's to major in History, I had packed up my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were puzzled.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had quit because I did not tolerate some of my college classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson jokingly announced that I had left because I was forced to drink from unopened cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I ran away, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my fancy name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, which was something intolerant and barbaric at the heart of the alleged illustration: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a leading adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
You might be wondering what that's all about now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred towards Conservative Party students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them demanded the same level of equal rights as gays, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (graduate student group) at Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often severely shunned, personally attacked and treated as ungrateful people" for their political views.
They want to create a seat on their college's equal opportunity committee to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and which portrayed the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a silver-handled cane.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated like "Turkish heads" for introducing higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Conservative Party Association at Nottingham University, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other".
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old Corpus Christi history student who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, a 19-year-old president-elect of the OUCA, says JCR members' attitude toward people who are center-right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate as well as to the wellbeing of members", he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, a terribly shy 18-year-old.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its peak.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an honorary degree following cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shudder in terror.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome for new university students, when the new students meet each other and the professors, I received a taste of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery of conservative academics but willingly participated in it.
The policy of the miners' strike, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminary.
The first one I attended was to translate 18th-century French texts into English, and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".
I didn't say a word.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cookie dough, knew how to expel bad bile.
"Is it that Thatcherites refuse to learn French or are they simply stupid?" he asked.
The other college kids laughed.
My eyes burned with tears I tried to hold in.
"I suggest you take French lessons in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people", Pitt growled.
I went back to my room like a grieving soul.
That night I sat alone at dinner time at the university; then I felt a slight pat on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who had applied to be a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's the way it goes.
They mess with anyone they think is Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories look like Labour".
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to cover it up.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick proved useless.
A first-year student of philosophy, politics and economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated".
Other students adopted that little song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked.
"You beat each other up, don't you?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the '60s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to date like-minded people only after dark?
Should I become a Labour and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years ahead presented themselves as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history assigned to my college.
They hated him for being not only a Conservative, but also Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote her speeches.
I was just there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and for its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University, in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he told me.
I began to commute daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded metropolitan relatives and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he was a student there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", she said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my Communist friends always had an impeccable attitude".
His aching eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just for fun.
It would break my heart if you let him".
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar at which another history professor had insinuated, speaking quite seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "stupid old men".
The truce was short-lived.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
Back then, my father wrote two columns a week for Murdoch's Press.
My door was locked.
I was inside, cowering in fear, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed up and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You may call me a weeping weakling.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to this level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only trained 14 Conservative prime ministers but which, to this day, hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentine prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro della Costura", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized this during the opening of "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", an apocalyptic retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "maison" during the last 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says in his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, which will be open until March 3, private letters and photos signed by the most important aristocrats abound, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino shows off these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from humble tailor in the northern Italian town of Voghera to international jet-set idol.
There's nothing wrong with being in love with royalty.
"At least they don't blow their pipes on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his villa in Gstaad", explains "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife, close to forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the couturier's charisma.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
There were 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decor, the food, the music, everything could see and feel his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved", recalls the top model, who began working with him during Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of style because its designs are works of art", he concludes.
The parade of the alcornia
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-received loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-meter-long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the walkway to gaze upon a dream "audience" that displays Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the wardrobe that Monica Vitti used in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of mannequins, names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophia of Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the tailor, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine's Day is like first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
"It was a gift from him", says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty", adds the former duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors you use, they're very bright and they're "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescribing Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can hardly forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of being old enough and having the opportunity to wear one of his nightgowns...
Finally, the time came in the late 1990's.
I bought my first Valentine's dress to wear to a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a skirt of flying, draped corsage and a slit word of honor.
"It was a dream come true", says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is with timelessness", explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her party dresses from the tailor with "the utmost care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the tailor calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory-colored silk suit with pearl inlays, 12 different types of lace, and a four-and-a-half-meter-long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, a leading authority on the trade press, the dress represents a milestone in late 20th-century haute couture, "the return of high-society clientele".
Blurred for years by the "savoir-être" of the elite, now Valentino is its best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always been impressed by its refinement, its calmness, its neat and perfect appearance", admits D'Arenberg.
Last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a good friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time does not pass for him".
If a princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: human mules from Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano porters risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilograms of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
Anto Wijaya is one of 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do so, it has to descend daily to the bottom of its crater, where sulfur gas emanating from the earth's bowels solidifies on contact with the air.
After pulling large rocks of sulfur, weighing some 170 pounds [70 kg], he carries them on two bamboo baskets over steep stone paths.
It is only a quarter mile to the summit of the volcano, which rises to 7,500 feet [2,386 m], but exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to make the tortoise-like ascent, balancing and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall off the cliff.
They know that any slip could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the cliffs of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents per kilo of sulfur they extract
Once up, they make their way among tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys, and, tirelessly carrying the heavy baskets, they walk two miles to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 6,000 feet [1,850 m].
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, better still, its workers, who are paid 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilo of sulfur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"We normally carry 70 kilograms [70 pounds], so we make about 46,000 rupees [$3,500] each way", explains Anto, who usually carries three portions a day.
It takes three hours each and ends up ground, but it allows you to collect 138,000 rupees ($12) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a pittance for such an inhumane effort, it's three times what I'd make in the field.
"The daily wage of the miners is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros) ", explains the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, her salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the cut was not so hard, but Anto has returned with her family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as compelling as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulties, coughing constantly and irritated eyes from toxic gases
At 27, Anto has been playing for three years at the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already started to take its toll despite covering her face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathing difficulties, a constant cough, and irritated eyes from toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I'll work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French", he promises in a more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly, intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter, or a hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters, she gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur keeps on melting at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the midst of the darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends to the crater illuminated by a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 porters carry the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs or supplied any equipment to the porters, who work for themselves and at such a heavy load.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees ($1.95) camera surcharge that, along with the 15,000 rupees ($1.95) admission fee, the park's guards charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for beasts and not for people", protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old stocky porter who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving school.
He can lift up to 110 kilograms, and he says he will work "as hard as he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, ages 18 to 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and scars the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns coming out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of serious illness - beyond, of course, their usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, knee pain and shoulder sores, which have been deformed by the weight of the baskets.
Swinging the basket on his back, Unainik can now only carry 50 kilos at 53 years old.
Each day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 11 miles [18 km] away along a goat trail through the bush.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life", Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth wide, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works as a sulfur loader.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the world's toughest trades: that of the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem unlikely that these lines are part of a mint pill ad, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (cake) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hopeful that with the advert they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill "their national duty".
This is purely an Internet thing, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world at reproducing ourselves, so we felt this was an issue we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing pheromone perfumes or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, which is compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one that doesn't take it so lightly is the Singaporean government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it is because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"That has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family", he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increased singleness, and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, a European immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to cope with the declining population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that are full of thinly disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party last year experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to keep the small houses from being built.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has now started to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers from building large, family-friendly homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of real estate firm EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They're more popular, in the sense that the units run out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking with Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, housing is expensive and so is education, so many people are putting it off", says one young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But having my own money and time is important to me", says a young man in his 20's.
Both men and women cite career, stress, and the cost of property and education as reasons for not having children.
So as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the final say.
Private offline is private online.
It's privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of private or "the area of private life that one has the right to protect from any intrusion".
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How do you apply this definition to your daily life and social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by airing situations online that you would probably not share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys aged 10 to 15 who were frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very personal", on the personal level, and "in the password and user name", when applied to social networks.
"I wouldn't post my deepest secrets", says ten-year-old Jorge, as he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret, my mom may know them, but not everyone", she says.
I put up pretty pictures or games on FB.
I also entertain my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine, or someone who was making a fool of myself", he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to post obscene photos, nude people, crimes, or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother's included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just pick them up", he adds.
"Social networking is fun, and I can quickly communicate with distant relatives and friends", she says.
He would never hesitate to say that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't listen to someone who recommended you to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admitting not to know 20 of the people added to his friend list.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example", he says.
According to the boy, no one has ever told him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I am pressured or demanded to do something, I simply take it off my list", he admits.
Jose became a Ask follower after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who I was", she says.
Victim, according to Jose, didn't close the account.
"Just gave her privacy".
Then it explains a series of steps to configure the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
He would if I didn't like him or if he wanted me.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying", he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet began as a means of finding information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game changed", he says.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning", he says.
He says the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite criterion of what is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or say at an age when maturity is not there".
"They also need to be selective when their main concern is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents about privacy is through thought-provoking questions.
"Telling them not to do it is no good", he adds.
Porras then lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like to have a photo of you posted like you posted a friend's?
You know what the others are posting about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask the other people's permission to tag them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing every second?
Another point is to make them see that they should act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same should be the case in social networks", he says.
The Commission
Educational consultant and university professor, Estuardo Guardia, says that parents should read social networking policies carefully.
By understanding each of these points, parents have a solid basis for discussing the implications of opening an Internet account with their children.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or post", he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson "don't talk to strangers".
Unasur summit ends without making public the Lima Declaration
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending leaders.
Efe tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Cancillery and Presidency initially said they would hand it over after the closure, but later said it would be published on the Peruvian Government's website.
When asked about the text, they pointed out that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the video of the presidential assembly without sound was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, audio restricted".
The little information that circulated among reporters was delivered by press spokesmen from some of the governments of the UNASUR attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian one.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents attending, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more data.
The Peruvian presidency subsequently sent an email to the media with the summit's "final statement", but it is Humala's pronouncement, not the official document that closed the summit.
In October last year, Peru hosted the III South America-Arab States Summit (ASPA), and despite press demands, the Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not published.
The official website of ASPA confirms that the document was published on Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure secure transmission systems for all journalists but limited information gathering to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court to settle a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional summit and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both sides, in the process Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will take and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today", Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country respectful of international law, of the peaceful solution of disputes, of treaties and international courts", added Piñera, and greeted Humala with a handshake, beside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered seriously erroneous.
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the morning deliberations and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The President read the final document in which he informed that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will make "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residence".
He said that actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, access to low-cost internet in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters".
With Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and foreshadow a better future for our peoples", Humala added.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and borders...uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits", the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to reincorporate it into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations between neighbours was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional summit that he hoped to meet with his Nicaragua counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat respectfully the maritime dispute after a ruling by the CIJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega", Santos said.
"We are going to review all these roads, they are not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua", he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope I can tell him that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the taking of command of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
The EU's defence ministers also met to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the provisional presidency of the regional bloc.
"Suramerica must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "Suramerica, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".
He defended, in that sense, the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want to return us to the past", he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also expressed his support for the reorganisation of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he was not sorry about the decision because he did not betray his principles, but respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time, "there were substantiated suspicions that Assange was being extradited to a third country and that his process was not being respected".
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary for requiring him to be interrogated on his territory for a sexual offence when "Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious", said the Ecuadorian president.
What is true is that there is a danger that your physical and mental health could be affected by being confined to a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
"That complicates anyone's health", he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a safe conduct permit to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant conversations.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of proceedings in different European instances", he said.
And he said that if Britain gives the safe passage tomorrow, this is over.
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to reassert himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians but the bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion", he said.
In that regard, he welcomed that these journalists are no longer "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and said that if re-elected, he will "deepen the revolution to continue the right way and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and the coup dressed in legality" because in reality "destroyed the legitimacy of paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
The Court has not yet ruled on this.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
We have to process them in a broad way to overcome them and move forward.
He also hoped for a good conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to seek international recourse if the two countries commit to accepting the ruling no matter how hard it is".
Referring to the possibility of him running for a third consecutive term in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, he said he sees that possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, that socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one guaranteeing that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility", he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president and we'd be out of the public eye.
If we lose, we lose.
"It's a decision", he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that he was expected to spend the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez", he commented.
The Ecuadorian head of state took part today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause for late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed: AIDS positive.
"It was like a bomb fell on me", he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make "softer", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
She decided to take care of her illness on her own and began to learn about it; with such determination that she celebrated her 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he joined in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was carrying a cut".
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it's possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
Still, many people, unaware of their illness, arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "depleted" their immune system, and become victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least the first cases reported, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same", said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring to this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious diseases expert Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but that the survival years and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system of patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for non-drug users: up to 30 years with a CD4 count of 200 and 50 years with a CD4 count of 500.
In simple words, this means that those diagnosed with HIV at age 25 "as long as they are under control, they can live without problems until they are 75", the interviewee explained.
To measure this progress, it is worth remembering that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 have died as of May this year; however, it is assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years we haven't had a shortage of medicine. The problem is that patients arrive very late because they don't know their infection status, which is late stages of the disease.
He made a strong point: "Nine out of ten patients arrive with an opportunistic infection. What is needed to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and therefore to offer screening tests on a massive scale to all those who require it".
The proposal was endorsed by specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a private laboratory to get tested, motivated only by a friend and despite his young age, already in the stage of AIDS and even suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'd better blow myself up three times a week", they say no to me.
The change was to get better, eat right, exercise, take my medication.
To date, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but I am also responsible, I take care of myself and the other person", said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let them get tested, let them know if they were at risk, let them know the sooner they know if they're HIV positive, the better, and if they're already diagnosed, let them learn that they can live like anyone else, be responsible.
That, his message, sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
The gaps between health programs and the common citizen are huge, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapatío journalist who has taken on the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "effectively increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those today, still, do not have access to a condom", he said.
Among those most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, with grumbling and value judgments from social workers, school guidance counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed re-orientating this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not just behind the counters and those 100 are in dispatchers of public toilets of places frequented by young people.
It's not about promoting promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González answered, when asked if there would be condom distribution in his Administration.
"This is not sexuality, the best thing is to bring condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity", he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state ranks 4th nationally in new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% are blood-borne and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV, as for every recorded case, there are four to five people who do not know it.
Ratified by a United States appeals court, a ruling that ignores the restructuring of Grupo Vitro's debt achieved via a commercial tender in Mexico, the scenario sets a nefarious precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would seem, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of firms permitted by Mexican law are not valid in the country of the bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In practical terms, the backing of the judgment issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of foreclosure on their properties in Bravo.
However, the decision opens the door for Mexico's leading glass manufacturer to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
While the trial judge points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says that the main proceedings are in the Mexican-run commercial bankruptcy.
The first point would involve a lack of international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases involving companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for Uniformity in International Commercial Law was created to that end, with the American Law Institute as the arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, which recognised in the critical mass of the competition the debts of Vitro's subsidiaries to their parent company, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro's was not the first case where the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The fact is that, in any case, if we subtract the votes of the subsidiaries, the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States courts, i.e. the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
The Court of Appeal omits this.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 to elude the serious economic crisis facing the United States, beating the country.
For now, the González Sada family will file a reconsideration appeal with the court of appeals itself so that the vote reaches the full court, meaning all five judges, given that only three voted.
If this fails, Cerciorare will appeal to a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
The seriousness of the case is that the court sidestepped a document sent by the Mexican government under the guise of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competitions Act, noting that it was discharged with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to tie it to chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensure fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-way caramel: they beat Vitro and they beat the country.
General balance sheet
The allegations put on the table by the Mexican aviation unions against the company's former owner, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, have been dormant for several months.
The instance headed by Carlos Diaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal suit against the National Banking and Securities Commission who is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General's Office of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the F/589 trust of Banco IXE, in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
The resources would have been channelled into the purchase of shares in the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're near the Dragon Mart.
Gathered at a forum at the University of the Caribbean over the weekend, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal sales and distribution centre for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast area to oppose the monumental thing that razed part of protected areas and poses the mother of all the enemies against the industry.
ACTA is dead.
Undermined by the government's demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already gone to the file.
As you know, the action was taken despite the fact that the Senate itself had dismissed the possibility as an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debt without affecting short-term debt, home developer Homex is putting 500 million pesos worth of Certificates Bursatals on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical ones offering to pay interest every 28 days.
Competitive is born
A consortium with the social name Competival has just been formed, made up of the leading companies in information technology, NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, with the aim of providing services to the software clusters in Central and South America.
The investment in this area exceeds 1.5 trillion dollars.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Basketball Trotamundos Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of the board and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of local basketball history as extensive as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, be it as a minor league player, National Senior Basketball player, pro and manager in the BSN with the Bayamón Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I wore many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 90s", Reyes recalled during a visit to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes that claim.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his extensive career, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all the ones he treasures with the greatest emotion are those that recall his time with the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old serving as co-owner or owner of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight championships for the Cowboys since 1967, whether as a proxy, co-proxy or a leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I parted ways with one in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy debuted on BSN.
From there on, "Cuco" Ortiz took over, who was a great administrator", Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been conducting here and was at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me, "I got you a very strong player, 6'7".
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember you said if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another.
The Cowboys' championship with Gausse was a success, but it was a long way off, as by 1988 he was a federation champ.
By that time, he preferred to enjoy his performances and those of Mincy on the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the Pre-Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and should have been bronze if not for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, said Reyes.
That 1990 World Cup group is the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a boost to the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the one that won us bronze at the Worlds.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the one at the Pre-Olympics in Neuquén, Argentina, in 1995.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended for the Mar del Plata Pan American mess, we won gold against all odds.
Who's been the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was definitely Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has mastered at that level like Piculin did.
And that's not counting his track record in the different leagues he played in.
Who's been the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good litter that included Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I like Leo Arill's work very much.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, like the regionalisation of the minor categories.
For example, that the Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now kids are traveling and playing too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and courses for managers, desk officers and referees.
I'm glad to hear it.
What are you doing now?
What I do most is listen to music, watch YouTube music videos from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R"., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played a ruthless, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. on a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by "Dallas" production company Warner Bros.
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he loved most", the family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to everyone he met.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, caring and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest", Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995 a malignant tumor was found in his liver and he underwent a liver transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light-hearted comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he meets an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him in his home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Her film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly detestable J.R. that brought Hagman to his peak stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", meant to generate anticipation around an emotional episode in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risked in bookmakers.
It also helped give the series a record-breaking viewership at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million television viewers tuned in, making "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment show in history, behind the 1983 finale of "MASH", which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. knocked her up and then threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left town, but others had motive to attack him, too.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), committed.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s tombstone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, on and off screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each and every one of us, that we were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
He had already finished filming five of the episodes for the second season and a sixth was in the works, the network reported.
There was no immediate word from Warner or TNT on how the series will handle Hagman's loss.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had it in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York stage in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 she titled her memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought was going to hurt anyone or affect them in any way", he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After the liver transplant, he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and after", he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it's gonna be a little uncomfortable for a little while, but you're gonna be okay".
He was also an activist against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
They're starting a course exploring the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the Mayan Calendar's "long countdown" on December 21, which many people have held on to as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what lay ahead in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called "two-armageddon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian end-time theorists believe the apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever", Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you look at what's been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember, bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only professor who's offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We look at why these ideas proliferate over time", he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
"I've tried to inform students about what's possible, probable, credible and impossible", Vacker said.
On the main campus of Penn State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled simply "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' so we always have the option of teaching the course again, in case the world doesn't end", Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end", Restall said.
The courses proved quite popular.
"It saturated in two hours", Restall said of his course for high-achieving students, which was filled with 35 students.
We got emails for weeks and weeks before the semester started from people asking if there was still room.
The students, on the other hand, say that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology major student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student majoring in psychology and nursing, said he has seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that", he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - let alone a teacher - said he believed in the December 21 expiration date.
"Our first project was about Mayan prophecy and we kind of discredited it", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, going back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
"Otherwhere people don't think about this", he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at La Salle University who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew of any courses on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines is not involved in the end of the world", he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been much talk of the final judgment days, and he said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe I'll call some friends and have a laugh", said 20-year-old communications student Samira Ford.
