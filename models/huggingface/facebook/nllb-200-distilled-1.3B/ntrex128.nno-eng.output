Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid of being taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently appalled by a proposal to change their names from assembly member or AM (member of the assembly) to member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came about because of plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A Labour member said his group was concerned by the MWP's remarks on Twp and Pwp
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means foolish and pwp means bæsj.
A member of the Plaid Party said the group ikkje is naked and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said his group has an open mind when it comes to the name change, but added that MWP is not far from the word muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced not unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The delegation of the National Assembly, which is now writing a bill to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on the names of the members of the National Assembly will of course be up to the members themselves".
A 2017 Welsh official decision gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the name proposal which showed strong support for calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of the National Assembly, the delegation prefers the Welsh Parliamentary Assembly (WMP), while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
The National Assembly members have reportedly come up with other proposals, but the fight to be unanimous has given the head of the delegation, Elin Jones, the task of delivering the bill in a few weeks.
The legislation of the reforms also contains other changes to the way the delegation functions, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
The members of the Assembly will be able to vote on their names when debating the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was intended to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would look away from the result.
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of membership in the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's cease while the churches of Harlem, New York, struggle
"The old lady I talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Adams.
 Today none of the parts are known.
He said he understood why the bars disappeared.
"People are socializing in different ways now", he said.
Bars are no longer the neighborhood places people go to.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the properties will not last as long as the leaders think, and sooner or later they are back where they started.
He suggested that churches could be replaced by community housing filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic sites of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white", he said. "And so the day will come when all the churches will be closed, because it is not likely that these people who move into the apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white parishioners before Harlem became a black borough - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Sankt Martin Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black parish priest who had been preaching in the area moved into the building.
Sankt Martin was taken over by a black parish led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shops in 125th Street, a Harlem shopping street where owners were against employing or promoting blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new bell.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and successor to the bishop of St. Martin, proudly called the bell the bell of the poor.
The expert who played the bell in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument that cannot be replaced".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play the larger bell in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in Sankt Martin in recent months has become a complicated tale of architects and building workers, some of whom are employed by the leaders of the laity of the church, and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish priest, who leads the parish and is composed of the leaders of the laity, wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese would ask the priest to pay, even though the priest was not involved in the diocese's hiring of architects and building workers.
Some of the members of the parish have complained about the lack of openness of the diocese.
13-year-old injured by shark during lobster diving in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was excited to have caught a lobster, before realizing that the boy shouted "Bite me!"
Something bit me!
"His whole collarbone was torn off", Hammel said he observed when he reached the boy.
"I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
Guten was picked up by air ambulance and taken to Rady Hospital for Children in San Diego, where his condition is critical.
It is unknown what kind of shark attacked the boy.
Badewakt captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that the shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy had serious injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most are not thought to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's stores offer beauty products
The British chain Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' beauty products and offer store services in the store.
As part of an investment in the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow while fashion and interior sales are down, Sainsbury's will test its beauty products in 11 stores next year, and more stores if it is a success.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with televisions, microwave ovens and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said it will double the number of beauty products to 3000 and offer the Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw brands for the first time.
They will give the brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burts Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand, as in the Boots stores.
The store will also relaunch its own boutique make-up line and make most of its products vegan, which will attract more young customers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test sales of its perfumes in two of Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon, London, last week, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small amounts of food every day from local small shops means that large retail chains must find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's managing director, has commented that the stores will look more and more like a supermarket, while the chain is trying to compete with the low-cost Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has joined with interior chain Argos in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores since they bought up both chains two years ago, which Sainsbury's claims has increased their grocery store sales and thus defended their purchases.
The chain's earlier attempts to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments were not a success.
Sainsbury's began working with Boots in the early 2000s, but this ended when the parties did not agree on how to share the profits from the stores' pharmacies.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-storey Celesio, which was owned by Lloyds, for £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still had a role to play and would offer an expanded luxury range of skin products, including the La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: We have changed the way the beauty shelves will look and feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also hired colleagues with specialized skills who will be able to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed to fit all needs, while our attractive environment and convenient locations mean we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old ways of doing things.
Peter Jones is stunned after Holly Willoghby withdraws from a £11 million deal
The star of the television programme Dragons, Peter Jones, is rasing after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a deal with his lifestyle brand worth £11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to promote their Truly brand of interior and accessories.
The pair's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning made the news known on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' star, Peter Jones, in the middle of the development of their new lifestyle brand to focus on her own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "shocked" when the golden Holly confessed during an intense meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of Jones's business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had time to collaborate on the Truly interior and accessories brand.
The collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce she would not be working with Truly, while Jones fled the UK to settle down in one of her holiday homes.
A source said: Truly was definitely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It was to be her long-term plan for the future, and it would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one believed their own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale.
Experts believe the decision by the This Morning host, one of the UK's richest stars, could cost the company millions due to hefty investment in products ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and interior, and could cause delays to launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's Im A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night We don't comment on his business dealings.
Serious conversations and then we fall in love
He was concerned about the criticism he was receiving from the media for coming up with a comment some might experience as upresidential and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump with his "news reader" voice.
 I haven't given up anything.
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step toward the disarmament of North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
But the nuclear weapons negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top diplomat of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not received a response from the United States regarding North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he added, the United States continues to impose sanctions to put pressure on North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's going great between us and North Korea", he said.
We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship.
He added that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - the end of rocket testing, aid to the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual approach to Kim's relationship.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there", said Trump, pointing to the group standing in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organizations were told that they were no longer needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's inhabitants had to flee, no one declared a national crisis, which is necessary to obtain international emergency aid.
"Unfortunately, they have been very clear in many cases that they don't want international help, so it's a bit challenging", Sumbung said.
While Redd Barna put together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain whether employees with foreign passports will be allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Crisis Management Agency, said authorities were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to offer emergency aid.
Although Indonesia is often subject to earthquakes, it is not particularly prepared for natural disasters.
In the Aceh area, they have built tsunami shelters, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite tsunami warnings in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to more victims.
Travel between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A medical ship that was docked in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving the infrastructure of Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent much money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for President Joko's administration, and next year there are elections again.
President Joko is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to flee as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.

Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal while the score was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before kicking it up and toward the goal.
The attempt sailed high over the penalty area and fauceted towards the upper right corner of the target.
Finally, the ball fell over a leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into goal.
"I was just trying to get in that position to get the ball, and I knew players like Shaq try to get as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and drop the ball one time without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 after the break after the 25-minute score by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Before the goal, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before spinning off near the midfield and into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic took the ball quickly on the midfield.
Then he shot it beautifully and led Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defence and scored with his left foot right past keeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15pm on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami: 832 deaths
The number of victims of the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's crisis agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, which occurred on Friday and had a force of 7.5 followed by 6 meter high waves, the spokesman for the crisis agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered in collapsed buildings.
British police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman was found murdered in Birkenhead, Merseyside, early today.
The 44-year-old woman was found knivstukken at 07:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have sought tips from local residents.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: The investigation is still in its early stages, but I urge anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also encourage everyone, including taxi drivers, who may have something captured on the dashboard camera, to contact us in case they have important information.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was from Birkenhead and was found in a home.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman came to the area to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and the police have stated that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to enter his own apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was at a loss for words when he found out what had happened.
The residents have been told not to enter their apartments for many hours.
One time, a police officer was overheard saying to a man that the whole area is a mess.
A woman came to the town and wept.
She says over and over again, "It's so horrible".
At 14 o'clock, two police cars were seen inside the band and one police car ended up outside the band.
A number of policemen stood in front of the police band and observed a block of apartments.
If anyone has information, they can send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling +44 (0) 800 555 111 with the reference log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament statue of Cromwell becomes the last victim of the rewrite of history
The removal of the statue would be the karma of Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England by his puritan followers during the civil war of the 17th century.
However, the Cromwell Association described Crick's proposal to remove the statue as "unfair" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, the chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster should be a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell would have been wrongly victimized by the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is a testament to the public opinion of the 19th century, and is part of the historiography of a figure many still consider worthy of celebration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, regarded as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was of course against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not is still a topic of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual who we know represented one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
Murder of Chinese peasants
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, surnamed Yuan, was found dead, pulmonary arteries cut and covered in blood, near a piggy bank at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer gives pigs vaccines on a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, he found his cousin dead, and discovered that the door to one of the pigs' pens was open.
He said that in the bingen was a big male pig with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy revealed that a 250-pound pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and destroyed", said the cousin, named Wu, to the Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera shows Yuan arriving at the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked inside to prevent him from attacking others, while police gathered evidence of the attack.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Although rare, such attacks from pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, causing serious injury.
Ten years earlier, a 295-kilogram pig was kept between a Welsh farmer and a tractor, until his wife frightened the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
They just want to play.
They like to bite a little, they're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them", he said.
Hurricane Rosa brings rain to the southwest United States
As predicted in the weather report, the storm Rosa is weaker over the cool waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry pøsregn to northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 05:00 a.m. in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, with its center 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is due to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and Rosa will approach the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, moving tropical humidity northward to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause heavy rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous floods and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall of between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the southwest United States, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest United States, particularly over large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous floods can occur due to spread terrain and tropical rainfall.
It is advisable to avoid walking in the desert due to the danger of tropical rain.
Rain can turn rivers into flooded rivers, and lightning and thunderstorms can bring strong winds and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Total rainfall of over 1 centimeter is possible, which can create small streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the season in the region.
Spread tropical rainfall will begin in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rains increase late Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect heavy rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October may witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic gets colder, but tropical regions will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The next few days will see the late summer heat try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start on October, with 25 degrees and upwards from the southern part of the Great Plains to parts of northeastern United States.
New York City could reach 25 degrees Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term warming indicates that there is a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the US Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
Meanwhile, the political discussion surrounding the case continued, with the usual television programs of various broadcasting companies interrupted to reveal the latest news on Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI should investigate the allegations within the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had been drinking and trying to take her dress off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during an emotional interrogation, that he's 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people were likely to watch the broadcast on Friday.
The company arrived at this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The talks were not clear from other channels that showed the interception, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers who watch from the office.
To put this in perspective, that's a similar number of viewers watching a US Soccer Final or the Oscars.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the most-watched during the day with 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested in the hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, a moderate Republican, declared that he was on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while protesters shouted at him on his way to a hearing with a judge's committee on Friday.
He stood and stared at the ground for several minutes while the protestors were fucking at him on CNN live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling our country the truth?
Some said to him, "You have power, but so many women have no power".
Flake said his office has spoken, and before he entered the elevator he said he wanted to have more to say during the committee hearing.
The circuit court broadcast the hearing on television, with the judge's committee voting for or against Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate and further voting.
But Flake said he could only do so if the FBI investigates the allegations against Kavanaugh within the next week, something that Democrats have also demanded.
Flake was partly convinced after talking to his comrade, Democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision proved to be powerful, because it was clear that the Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of "political misconduct" over Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, accuses critics of her plans to leave the EU of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom without regard to national interests, in an interview with The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party conference on 29 September 2018.
Next to the interview with May on the front page of the Sunday Times is an interview with former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, in which he attacks the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says that the proposal that the UK and EU should collect each other's taxes is completely absurd.
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting that killed 20-year-old Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned for murder, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is affiliated with CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set at $350,000, reports local newspaper The Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge coroner made public an early obituary report on Friday that indicated the cause of death was a gunshot to the head.
The Baton Rouge Police Department thanks the Louisiana State Police Special Forces, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police Department and local residents for helping them find Simpson.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their vigilance in the pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2-meter-tall basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points per game last season with 2.6 rebounds.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "troubled" after Wayde's death.
"That's something we're always afraid of", Wade said.
The volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern parts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Crisis Prevention urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after activity increased in the crater and the center recorded 183 gas and ash discharges in 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media show thin layers of ashes on cars in various neighborhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as Don Goyo and has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of independence
Six protesters were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police, and thousands of other protesters protested independence one year after the vote on eventual independence from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police while they threw eggs and powdered lacquer that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Clashes broke out later in the day, and police used batons to prevent escalation.
For hours the separatists shouted "Never forget, never forgive" while the independence protesters shouted "Long live Spain".
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries after the protests.
The mood is still pressing in the region and many still want independence one year after the October 1 vote, which was declared illegal by Madrid, but was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voted for independence, but there was also low violence among those who were against independence and boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent the vote and violent clashes erupted in the region.
Independent groups slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration however went off the stables, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of independence for Catalonia.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote for independence, but now we're stuck again", he said.
Although they won the regional elections in December, the pro-independence Catalan parties are struggling to hold on to power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The excitement is increasing", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been the subject of ongoing legal proceedings since last year, declared that he will stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
"To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the retreat of democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state", he said.
Londonderry, Northern Ireland: Men arrested for intentionally crashing into houses
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested for deliberately crashing into a house in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the car caused damage to the entrance gate and the building itself.
A armbrush may have been used to shoot at the car.

Livingston surprised Rangers and Steven Gerrard experienced his second victory after 18 games as coach of Ibrox in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to be the difference, while Gary Holt's side evened with Hibernian in second.
Gerrard's side have no away winners in the Scottish Premiership this season, and will play Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has six wins in a row, and Holt has not lost since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses chances against the away team
Holt's team would have led long before they scored, creating more problems for Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low effort towards goal, which caused Alan Lithgow to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create trouble for the away team.
And that's how the decisive goal was scored.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touchdown and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
Before then, the Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow flicked away after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passes were sent back and forth in the Livingston penalty area, while two penalties - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one for hands - were waved away.
'Fenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal fight and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Every player played fantastically and still impresses on the curve upwards.
Their style of play has hardly changed since returning to the top flight, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he has shocked the team since he became a trainer.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, organizing a defense at the military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the fight.
Rangers, on the other hand, were not motivated.
Even as good as they have been under Gerrard, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and only cut up the home run once, which should make the Rangers realize they can't reach up anymore.
Erdogan receives mixed welcome in Cologne
The heads of state of Turkey and Germany smiled under the blue sky as they met for breakfast on Saturday, September 29 in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is expected to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries have been divided over human rights, press freedom and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Köln to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of over 25 000 from gathering in front of the mosque for "security reasons", but many of Erdogan's supporters met up to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also met to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German state's decision to welcome him.
The duelling protestors reflected the divide between German Turks, who see Erdogan as a hero, and others, who see him as an autocrat.
Car accident in Deptford, London: Cyclist killed after collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east London, at 10:15 local time.
The driver stopped and ambulance personnel quickly arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred only a few months after another cyclist died when the driver stumbled off Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometres from the accident.
The London police said they were identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been closed and buses must drive around the area, while other drivers have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison in England: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, the prison office in England says.
The ongoing disturbance broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special Tornado-forces are mobilized to quell the uprising, which involves eight prisoners in a secluded part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for small facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Specialist trained guards will calm down the ongoing uprising in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are aware that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to spend more time in prison.
There are more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in Britain.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated for injuries after a prisoner went on the attack.
And last October, special forces had to come to the prison to quell a serious riot, where inmates threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flooding (in favor of drought areas)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is precisely this weather phenomenon that is heading toward Arizona early next week, as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pull southwestward over the desert and create fears of flooding.
The National Weather Service issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and may rain as early as late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only twenty tropical cyclones have had tropical storm- or low pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometers within the Arizona border.
The latest models from the national hurricane center report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
Rainfall ranges from 2 to 5 centimeters in other areas of the southwest, including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated total amounts up to 10 centimeters.
For areas outside flood risk, the rain from Rosa can be a blessing in drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, this rainfall will likely benefit areas of the southwest United States that are prone to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, extreme drought is over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest drought category, reports weather.com.
First, the hurricane Rosa moves over the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
With winds of over 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and roars down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm strength, Monday afternoon or evening.
It's going to rain heavily in parts of Mexico, which could increase the risk of flooding.
Rainfall between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a possibility of up to 25 centimeters, weather.com reported.
Rosa will move northward along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will move further up through Arizona and into southern Utah Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger of Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the American southwest desert", the national hurricane center said.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening floods in desert areas and landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset, England.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04:00 on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, reports Avon and Somerset Police.
The police have urged anyone who may have cell phone footage of what happened to contact us.
Trump says Kavanaugh "screwed" during how "bad and angry" the Democrats were against him
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the merciless and unfair tactics of the Democrats", Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered under the "bad and angry" Democrats through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her debts during the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the American people saw how brilliant and courageous Kavanaugh was that day.
"A voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice of one of the most gifted lawyers of our time, a lawyer with impeccable public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the Republican primary.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not posing, but I'm really posing, he said.
That's why I travel around fighting for good candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats are looking to resist and block.
The first important vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place later Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, counting the dead
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them by huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Sunday.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate the festival on the beach in Palu on Friday when the six-meter-high waves hit the beach at sunset, taking many lives and destroying everything they came across.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not go with one time and so they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian BNPB crisis relief agency, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami wasn't enough, it took cars, trestams, houses; it hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived that way.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos published by the crisis agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The quake continued to hit the coastline on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in the surrounding area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Bureau of Testing and Technology (BPPT) said the earthquake's energy was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of the dead were found under the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and the extent of the destruction may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, the communication is cut", Nugroho said.
"More than 300 000 people live there", the Red Cross said, adding that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said waves had come within the timeframe warned.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man in the top floor of a building desperately calling out to people down the streets to warn them of the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify the video right away.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages and cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate emergency aid.
The military has started the process of sending emergency relief from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but the refugees still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airports were reopened to receive emergency aid, but will remain closed until October.
It was planned that President Joko Widodo would visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia exceeded 800.
That's really bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city, and set up tents in the backyard of their office, passing through the totally destroyed area on their way to the city, Doseba said.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses", he said.
That's really bad.
While emergency aid organizations are starting work to help the tsunami victims, some have complained that foreign emergency workers with expertise in crisis management have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organizations and their employees cannot start work until Indonesia has declared the area a national crisis zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"There is a crisis at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the state says "OK, this is a national crisis", we can open up international emergency aid, but they haven't updated the status yet.
It is evening again in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those still missing still hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not end well.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the toilet.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had been held captive by her deceased mother for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders from the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man named Mandagi said that some of the people who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As someone with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear", he said.
Gendon said he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the paragliders from Palu, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after hearing that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
However, his messages only showed one grey hook, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think it means the messages didn't come through", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from a cash machine in Newport, Levee, USA
On Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brinks worker while he was filling a minibank in Newport, Levee, USA, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The worker had just emptied a minibank in the entertainment area and was in the process of delivering more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the press release.
While the worker was busy, a man ran up behind him and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police could not determine the number of persons involved in the robbery.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: Skeptically known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been known by the nickname Ye for some time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change came just before he was scheduled to appear on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show after she cancelled due to emotional reasons, said the program host.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think the word ye is the most common word in the bible, and in the bible it means you, West said earlier this year when he was discussing the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye -- to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects who we are.
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West in the past, has also changed the spelling of his name with and without binding and large letters.
The future president of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians, marking the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at peaceful protesters, killing around 300 people, in a time when left-wing student movements were spreading in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening more free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led to youth joining criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence.
Since China is increasingly working on artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the US government expressed their views on artificial intelligence, although the US lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence", Lee said.
A doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence will happen in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order this month via publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's largest artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest-ranked player of the game Othello, and later worked as head of Microsoft Research and chairman of Google in China.
Lee acknowledged earlier technology competitions organized by the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would be, so he could be there to identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired excellent university students to work on artificial intelligence over the last few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhD students in artificial intelligence should be automatically granted residency", he said.
The State Council of China published its plan for next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Federation of Science funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the US National Federation of Science and other government organizations' way of distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Defense Department established a joint center for artificial intelligence, which is meant to involve industry and academia partners, and the White House declared the formation of a committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science Foundation invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on the bill for national security and artificial intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of their country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether they should change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbour to the north represents a claim to its territory, and has used its veto to vote against Macedonia's membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change could undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia's population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott has sown doubts about how far the referendum will reach the at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the referendum seat is: Are you for NATO and EU membership and agree with the deal with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth membership in the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of Parliament have said they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name change to happen, the Parliament needs two-thirds approval.
The state election commission reported that nothing unusual had happened by 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voted, compared with 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in Strumika in the referendum on whether to change their name and open for membership in NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the referendum in front of the parliament in Skopje, setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not for changing the name of our country", Kavadarkov said.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that NATO membership will attract investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
"I think the majority will vote for the change, because 80 percent of our citizens will become members of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said that a ja result can be interpreted as a confirmation of our future.
An opinion poll conducted on Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum  which is below the required number.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, the network said 70 percent would vote yes.
The referendum must be approved by at least 50 percent of voters, plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it could harm the policies of the leftist government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton's defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defence to win 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine spiker received a pass on the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He hurled past three Brighton defenders and reached open ground.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender, before running past several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He came past a passing on the left and found Sterling.
The English striker used his first kick in the field to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the goal.
"Aguero is still struggling with his feet", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored when he did.
But it was Sterling who gave the sky blue the first advantage in the Premier League match.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep inside the Brighton territory.
He kicked the ball beautifully along the left end of Leroy Sane's court.
Sane held the ball while leading Sterling towards the goal.
The sky-blue spiker kicked the ball into goal just before he slid out of the court.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play a spoiler game against the Rockies in American baseball
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was little reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high competition instinct, and hopes to take the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to a playoff for the Rockies, who lead by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least 5-2 against the Nationals Friday night, but look forward to securing the division title.
Even though we're not playing for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who wouldn't want to play in those conditions?
It is still unknown who will start in Nationals on Sunday, but it is possible Scherzer will pitche.
Scherzer, who is in his 34th start, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitche normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump gathers voters in West Virginia
The president referred in obscure terms to his first election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of Republican voting in midterm elections in the United States.
Everything we have done so far is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm running all over the place fighting for the best candidates", he said.
Trump went on, "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're convinced that they're definitely going to take back the power, you see how weak they are, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to opposing and blocking.
"And you can see that based on the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "mad and bad and ugly and dishonest".
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who had his audience buckling.
Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who leaked documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen. 
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They're intolerant of anyone who says what they mean.
So when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't surprising.
I am the last in a series of Labour MPs who have been told I am not welcome - just for saying what I mean.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she was protesting anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic management, national security, Europe, and other similar topics that Jeremy ironically disagreed with previous leaders on.
The call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive".
For the last eight years I've been a Labour MP, Friday meetings have been just like this.
However, the meeting was not the same, and the promise of a "snellare" policy was long forgotten, if it was followed at all.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that every opinion is judged by the party leaders.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became party leader, at a time when colleagues who used to agree politically suddenly expected me to change my mind and agree on things I would never agree on - whether it was national security or the single market of the EU.
When I speak publicly, it doesn't matter what I say, I'm always getting booed on social media and people want me to resign while they criticize the policy of the centre and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who are faced with the sexist and racist harassment every day, and who are still professionals and don't quit.
One of the most deceptive aspects of this time period is how normalized it has become to harass politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone, because with every motion of no confidence and every change in the party rules, the party gets narrower and narrower.
I've had a lot of advice in the last two years from people who've said, "Take it easy and be quiet, because maybe people will like me better".
But that's not why I chose to get into politics.
When I joined Labour, when I was still going to school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how her government had failed the country, my classroom was falling apart, and I wanted better public services for those who needed them most -- whether it was as a city councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, not even in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can have any doubt about what I stand for and which of the current leaders I disagree with.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will harm private, local businesses and public services, I don't understand why people would want to waste energy questioning my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But actually, the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in my constituency, whether they are Labour voters or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no one can make me resign or change my policies or stop me from serving you in the way I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr go to top in Scottish rugby
Two late tries may have changed the result a bit, but there is no doubt Ayr were hoping to win this very entertaining Tennents Premiership match today.
They are now on top of the table as the only undefeated team in the top 10.
It was their sovereign defense and ability to take chances that gave the home team and their coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in the last battles, and we are still invincible, so I must be content", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "They deserve credit, they were better than us at taking chances".
Grant Anderson had a try in the 14th minute, with Frazier Climo attempting a conversion, which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes from the Warriors allowed Melrose to collect, and Jason Baggot took an unconverted try.
Climo received a penalty just before the break, scoring and converting a solo try to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the slingring by five points.
A long pause ensued when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and put on a stretcher, and from the start Ayr faced forward through a try from Stafford McDowall, who converted Climo.
The acting captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, was given a yellow card, and Melrose again tried an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball from the penalty box, MacPherson scored a try.
Climo converted again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry away from home his fifth try.
The star of the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant industry
Scottish Still Game star Ford Kieran seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry after being discovered to be the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC programme, which he writes and stars in alongside his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested that Kiernan would be involved in the "progressive restaurant industry" in Glasgow.

These hopes are perhaps stronger than in decades as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Criminal Court on October 1, after five years of siege.
"Bolivia is driven, calm and united, and of course expects a positive result", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are eager to see the judgment of the International Court of Justice, in the hope that the Hague court will uphold Bolivia's claim, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - will grant Bolivia an independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia -- who is running for re-election next year -- has good reason to hope for a positive outcome.
"Now we will return to the Pacific Ocean", he promised in late August.
But some analysts don't think the court is going to allow Bolivia access to the ocean -- and that even if they did, little would have changed.
The Netherlands-based UN court has no authority to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The court's decision comes only six months after the last negotiations, indicating that the case was complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have far from advancing Bolivia's cause, they've done the opposite.
The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration, Zárate said.
Morales, with his struggling rhetoric, has killed what was left of Chile's goodwill, Zárate said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the problem after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile and a chance to put an end to 139 years of unity and to benefit both, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime problem to win votes.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
Judgment is a chance to see what we need to do to forget the past.
North Korea says they won't abolish their nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday in the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow up on the pledge made during the Singapore meeting between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when the US foreign minister, Mike Pomepo, appears to be eager to restart his stalled atomic weapons diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will submit if it continues to impose sanctions and opposes any declaration of the end of the Korean War.
Washington refuses to agree to a possible declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolishing it first.
Both Kim and the US President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical of Pyongyang's seriousness in its defence efforts and its view that its weapons are a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris' massive headwear fashion show is headed to a shopping mall near you.
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you don't need a hat anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a series of large and special headwear in their SS19 collection, which surprised the public during the Paris fashion week.
Highly impractical hats are on Instagram this summer, and these designers have posted their shocking creations right on the runway.
The most magnificent piece of clothing was a lavish, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, wide brim that covered the models' heads.
There were other oversized accessories on the show, including a jewel-encrusted watermelon, a wizard hat, and even an pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn together and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled a diving equipment, complete with a snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in a biscuit.
If you like this enormously dramatic fashion, you can just be excited.
Fashion experts predict that those huge hats will go on sale in a shopping mall near you.
The oversized hats come right after La Bomba, the straw hat with the 60 centimeter-wide brake that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult-brand behind the highly impractical hat, which was ubiquitous on social media, has now released a new creation on the runway - a straw-strand bag of the same size as the bikini-clad model who wore her.
The beach bag, a brushed orange color with a fringe topped with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the Paris fashion week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt it's possible to ignore the demand for overdimensional accessories.
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills.
Privatskole in Scotland is known for its high academic standards, which continued in 2018 with excellent exam results, only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30 000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), work to provide the best services to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart.
This is an important reminder that we can't rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the results from this year, we can see that language is at the top of the league tables with the highest marks for independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who took foreign languages got A.
The data, which was collected from the SCIS's 74 member schools, shows that 72 percent of the students got A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also got A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital attributes, which children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Language as an elective is considered equivalent to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and other institutions.
A survey conducted by the UK Select Committee on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17 percent of employers were unable to fill positions due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language is increasingly important in school to prepare young people for employment.
With multiple job opportunities for language proficiency, these qualities are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a young person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a decent advantage in the future with such a trait.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult Britons in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any language other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by that one-twentieth percent, 15 percent.
This is why it's so important to invest in language learning for our children.
Knowing multiple languages, especially those spoken in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, every school is different in what language they teach.
Many schools focus on the classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to creating an environment that prepares children and equips them to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
There's no denying that in this global, business-driven environment, languages are vital to the future of our country, so this has to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be called international communication properties.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, thus offering diversity and high competence to Scotland's young people.
It must be done.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James debut on the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason game on Sunday, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how long he will play has not yet been decided.
It's going to be more than one minute and less than 49. Walton announced on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell, doubted that James would play for a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get ready", he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a whirlwind of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned stops next week, including stops at friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending to fill the Supreme Court's vacant seat, Trump has aimed to build support for upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
When is Trump expected to be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to take up this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was agitated over allegations of sexual abuse, with a Senate confirmation vote expected to wait up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary goal of this gathering is to help the Republicans meet the November elections and gain momentum.
So, according to the Trump campaign, these five meetings next week are aimed at "upskilling" volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening gathering will bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday marks the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is popular in opinion polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the courage to fight to keep hope alive on Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept, but one that the players really believe in, and never more so than at competitions like this one.
So where would they say the moment is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so we're going to take that as a little moment, I guess", Jordan Spieth said as he walked out for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead with 12 more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in their sails, and they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each have three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and leads by example.
The boys' screams of celebration grew louder as his round continued, and a crucial putt sank to take match four all-squao.
His putt that won the game by 15 was met with a similar scream, the kind that tells you that he thinks the U.S. team is not out of this.
"You've really only got to dig deep and worry about your own struggle", Spieh said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undefeated history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's weird but cute couples are four out of four and can't make a mistake.
Moliwood were the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeyes on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a 18 hole course) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaged crowd, cement that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Talking about European honor is still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly worked with Sergio Garcia, the morning's fireball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, the spanjol and the swedish go into a hole they never got close to climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursome are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interaction between opponents, the advice they give, and the advice they don't give and the way that a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is taking a significant lead into the final day, but this foursome-session also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the fight that anyone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's fireballs and foursome matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take his fight so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, bidding to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a failtent American side in the morning fourballs, taking the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they could not get in the deficit.
Jim Fury's side need eight points from their 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood after a spectacular weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they gave themselves a great performance to beat an outsider Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more coveted 5 and 4.
Woods, who struggled through two matches on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fireballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning's fourballs, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe still didn't get everything they wanted on a nice, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American reference by two points on Saturday.
They won a courageous 2 & 1 victory over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit and gone into single, although as holders Fury's side only needed to draw to retain the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, it nevertheless looks like a Sunday counterattack will be outside them.
North Korea says that unilateral disarmament without trust is out of the question.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that if sanctions continue, the distrust of the United States will grow, and that the country would never give up its atomic weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly of the world's powers that North Korea had made "significant steps" to improve relations over the past year, for example, it stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and promised not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
We still don't get any corresponding return from the United States, he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible for us to unilaterally disarm first.
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington's resistance to a "fashioned" approach to the abolition of atomic weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his statement showed significantly that he did not reject one-sided nuclear settlement, as Pyongyang had done earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for the construction of nuclear power on the Korean Peninsula while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has long wanted a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its atomic weapons.
Washington has also resisted talks to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on "downbuilding nuclear power first" and increases pressure with sanctions to achieve its purpose by force, and they oppose even the declaration of peace, Ri said.
Believing that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that as the sanctions continue, our distrust only grows.
Ri did not mention the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months and added: If the party in this push for the dismantling of nuclear weapons were South Korea, and not the United States, the dismantling of the Korean Peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the US mainland, after the evil president Trump called Kim a rocket man on suicide missions.
Trump, who last year believed in the "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea dismantled its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia claim that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
But the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: The Security Council's sanctions must continue to be maintained vigorously and without fail until we achieve the complete, final, verified dismantling of nuclear weapons.
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to curb Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri at the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for coming with gangster-like demands.
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also an atomic complex if the United States took appropriate measures.
He said Kim had told him that the equivalent measures he sought were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and steps toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all students to get more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of studying all night in a caffeinated state, where you use caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
One academic found that top university students are often reckless when it comes to the most basic of things -- how to take care of yourself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after speaking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And at the end of it, this girl came up to me and said, "Why is this being told to me now, at an adult age?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after students experienced significant sleep problems during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one episode, there is a picture of a dormitory where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
'We know it won't change students' behavior right away.
But we think they have a right to know -- just like you have a right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride over being awake all day still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough, good quality sleep, he said, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety -- even against weight gain, since lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after being a student there the previous year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler advised that students should make sure to set an alarm for when they should go to bed, as well as when they should wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can completely reset the internal clock, leading to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga-goal gives Gerrard's men down
Rangers suffered another defeat on the away leg as Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's undefeated side to a 10 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox were looking to take their first victory on the ground since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side caused only Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as leader, giving eight points, one round below Ladbroke's Premier League leader Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime, and a Ranger-like performance lacking inspiration never seemed to match.
While Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be additional problems for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound, after an object was apparently thrown from the back.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that brought Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, however, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot the week before, and he would have been delighted with the way his well-riddled attire took the brunt of his opponents' attacks on every shift.
The Rangers may have had the ball most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored after just two minutes as Menga's first innings sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his kempesjansen.
A far free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow could only shoot far on the returnable.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the final third round.
Alfredo Morellos felt determined to have the 20 meters mark sanctioned when he and Steven Lawless collided, but judge Steven Thomson waved the colombian's wish away.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly worried by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tamed shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the rules, no one can deny that they forgave him for the shot.
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep deadball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson, who held his cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard left in the break as if he had replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change caused an immediate effect as the winger made a lock for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly raced forward to block.
However, Livingstone continued to outsmart the hosts to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending forward long shots on long shots.
Holt's team could have increased their lead at the end, but McGregor succeeded well in hindering Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow put in a long inning from the cornermark.
Ranger reserve Glenn Middleton had a new claim on penalties when he supported Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
Almanakk: The inventor of the geigelt
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE RECALL... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific reference point, the Geiger counter also became a pop culture reference point, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with the apparently unlikely late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What in the world is that?
Rogers: There's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example, uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that come from the radioactivity in the mineral.
Evans: Yeah, now it's bubbling!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to detect red cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize red blood cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize red blood cells, as part of the treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then look at a protein that is common in many cancers, and then re-engineer
A vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced her ovarian cancer disappear in more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can detect a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer, explained professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to harvesting immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has been used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West begins a Pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAGA-lue, after he guested on the TV show Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible performance in which he praised the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and said he would run for president in 2020.
After his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great cap, he gave the Democrats a tirade and reiterated his support for Trump.
So many times I talk to a white person, and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the show with a number with comedian Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual assault charges against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, the recording of West's tirade was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with the post.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficulty backstage due to his headwear.
They were bullying me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on".
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a downward spiral", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken space?" saying that he would put on the Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love.
His comments led to at least two public outcries, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassedly affected, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: The entire studio was dead silent.
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, as her former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STARING OPP MOT PØBELEN.
But talk show hostess Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "simply" who he is and that's totally fantastic.
But I chose NOT to pay anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe embraces and spews out an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
We are too she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Along with Snoop Dogg, Snoop Lion and of course the last music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Tried for attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused are expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The debts will be assessed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on screen often lead young boys to feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought something had gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "quite strongly" to address the issue.
"Personally, I'm convinced that something has gone wrong with masculinity".
What have we taught men when they grow up, about the problem we face now?
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is born and what is learned?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets, what makes young boys feel that they have to be this particular side of being a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because it's obvious that something's gone wrong with the young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be making Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series ends this summer, and said he was "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers his meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so that's how I got my future family and my life going", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the outcast of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-award winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who got HIV this way, was reduced to almost zero, a Chinese health official told a conference in the Yunnan province.
However, year by year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ people is claimed to be more widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have shown that 70-90 percent of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases are transmitted through inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that if she receives any information from GOP senators, it explodes into "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
USA Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat argued that the claims were pedalized by extreme-right-wing investigations and websites.
"Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included home addresses and telephone numbers of the Americans, Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information, which appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing about the sexual assault charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and released the information to a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This groundless claim is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
One of my employees -- whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and false allegations -- was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This groundless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Water's remarks were quickly criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is outrageous", wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
If someone is being judged for something they did not do, do not be angry.
They don't have to be tough.
They must not question the motives of the debtor.
They have to be calm and peaceful.
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was blamed by critics for being apparently too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to take Waters's seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"As if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified the proper authorities and law enforcement of these false claims.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, she continued, and that they will be held legally responsible for their actions which are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my employees.
Johnny English strikes again - spy toll by weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit-related quirks in all new films with a British angle, and that seems to be the case with this revival of Johnny England's action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the self-deprecating satire about how openly miserable we are become the new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, the big-eyed, incompetent Johnny English with the rubbery attitude has for the second time gotten his permission to fucke things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creator for cinematics in non-English-speaking countries.
He's, of course, the stupid, secret agent who, despite his bizarre urges to spread some glamour, has gotten a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes a simple melody to the Fire Cars, the theme of the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
It is also based on the traveling and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, which left chaos in the wake.
There's one or two nice blinks in this last JE excursion.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while wearing a medieval suit of armor while the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on the screen, but the humor is felt rather weakly and strangely superfluous, especially since serious filmmakers like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels as if it's directed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replica-free jerk in the person of Bean.
The permanent current premise now is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all agents Britain has on the ground, much to the horror of the agent on duty -- a sadly minor role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a pompous and war-hardened prime minister who already has a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there's not much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that when every active spy has been accused, she must bring in someone retired.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at a somewhat elegant establishment but gives unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of nice jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type academy for espionage.
English is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former understandable assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moved over to a submarine pilot job, an overenthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things go horribly crazy in Her Majesty's Secret Service is back for good in the encounter with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic technology billionaire, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problem: the formidable Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farcelike wild game: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle themselves aboard Volta's pleasure boat; and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are probably pulled up to the last sequence, but as lovable and undisciplined as it is, there's quite a bit of children's TV all over it.
Quite moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party is denying that they are working on a plan to make the English work four days a week but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is now considering a radical plan that would put the British working four days a week - but get paid for five.
According to the report, the party wants company leaders to pass on the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, by giving them an extra day off.
Then employees would be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea would adapt to the economic agenda of the party and plans to increase benefits for workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changed economy.
An older Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy message is expected to be announced before the year-end.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a wish that fits into the party's approach to balancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the overarching of the party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek in its election campaign in 2017.
The ambition is however not for the blink of an eye approved by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said, "A four-day workweek is not party politics and it is not being considered by the party".
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the previous week's conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "insensitive" directors and "profit makers" in wealthy companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders of the water company cannot get back their entire stake as a Labour government could take action due to perceived misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to provide 10 percent of the private sector's own capital to employees, who would receive annual dividends of up to £500, approximately 5000 kroner.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, in the TV show 60 Minutes, about the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of how the agency's findings could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in 60 Minutes asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
I said, going into the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out, and said, 'Have you done that?'
He was determined, firmly determined, unambiguous.
Graham's voice is nevertheless set in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it", Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
Yet none of them could prove what she had said.
That's 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an enormously impressive lineup of performing stars and an equally impressive mission; end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's grand plaza, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or actions as volunteer work; send an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or other meaningful ways to contribute to raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to reach their goal?
Is this idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to demand a call to action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feeling like they're making a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million actions from its supporters, participating in and pressuring a variety of targets.
It says that these actions have enabled world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the safeguards have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs committed to "helping children reach their full potential"; pledges to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,  told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after they had taken more than 5000 actions to demand that the UK be better at nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In response to one of the most common questions on their website, they ask: "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
And global citizens said, "It's going to be a long and difficult road -- some times we're going to fail and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements leading us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a blockade to prevent Russian energy exports - Secretary of State
Washington can if necessary use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as cited by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria -- especially where it operates on the invitation of the legitimate government -- is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to transfer energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, blockade to ensure that their energy does not go to the market, he said.
Zinke spoke at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an nonprofit group that presents itself as the voice of the energy consumer in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic solution for Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel", he said, while pointing to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been tasked with increasing the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this context, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the passande Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin Moscow's prison.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has withdrawn its support from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would take a "grunt" look at running for president after the midterm elections.
During a Council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and that includes a woman at the top", she said according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will consider running for president.
Warren took on President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said he's "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been harsh in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should run for president in 2020.
51 percent of likely Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a round of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidacy include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially announce his decision in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) on the Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday evening.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through when he comes back, allows me to relate to other families who are suffering from PTSD and some of the wounded that our soldiers are returning with", she told the audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the elephant in the room and said of his son and other war veterans that they come back a little changed, they come back to her, they come back and wonder about the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and flyers and all other military, have done for the country, exists.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for disturbing a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supporting new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions fits the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filing in August against the federal government has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and the violent gang members' sons abused her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Advocates for the states supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as producing a large number of American asylum seekers, as nations facing pervasive problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from the immigration law, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy ignores many decades of state, federal and international law.
Federal law requires that all asylum cases be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle is contrary to this principle, said the friend-of-the-court brief.
Lawyers further argued in the summary that policies that deny immigrants access, harm the U.S. economy, and say they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "offer necessary labor".
General Counsel Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death tolls double in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It's a very emotional feeling", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her feverish baby son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, ambulances arrive with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find.
Residents are observed returning to their destroyed homes, searching through water-damaged properties and trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the devastated hospitals, which had a magnitude of 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulders, rested outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed into the ruins of the Wall, I think", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of mobbing with propaganda-advertisements
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page advertisement in an American daily highlighting the mutual benefits of trade with the United States and China, the American ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid subscription to the Des Moines Register - Iowa's largest daily newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, a debt China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in US elections marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has put them in the grip of increasing taxes on each other's imports.
China's tariffs early in the trade war were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the American ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", Branstad wrote in a Sunday Des Moines Register opinion piece, "is now doubling the bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"In its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you'll find a few dissenting voices and they won't see any true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic trajectory, given that the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party wrote he.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are representing female voters ahead of the midterm election with Kavanaugh's Debacle, warns Analytiker.
As many top Republicans stand by and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple accusations of sexual assault, the analyst has warned that they will likely see a setback, particularly from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment around this has been extremely high, and most Republicans are on have already registered that they want to go ahead with one vote.
These things are not to be regretted, says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) 's last momentary pressure for an FBI investigation will be enough to amuse angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday to the Washington, DC-based newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" while demonstrating in the Senate chamber as the Republicans, who control the court committee, chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be outside the chart", Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it may be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual assault against his nominated Supreme Court justices, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pressed ahead with the confirmation.
"This has become a confusing mess for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former head of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've handled her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, pointed out for the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little divided over who to believe in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more bias toward the latter.
A recent YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely laughed during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following press from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals while they were attending a party during their time at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology giant, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid lets users choose where data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is world domination.
We have to do it now, he said about the start.
It's a historical blink of an eye.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It may contain contact lists, memory lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all accessible in a browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about the personal web store is that it's completely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's executive director John Bruce, is that the company should bring resources, processes and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some contracted developers working on the project, as well as a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
 We don't ask for their permission. 
In an op-ed on the medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of great influence in the debate about net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web, Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross divinely celebrated
The only English church divine to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant has been commemorated in her hometown for 100 years.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was brilantly symbolic, that the stone would be unearthed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's prize-winning performance.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 through a very thick shell and under heavy fire from field and machine gun fire.
He later jumped up to the front line, and with his greatest gallantry led the line forward before he single-handedly rushed forward with a field gun and knocked out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something I know I could never live up to, but something I am humbled by.
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to play a role in the parade, adding that the value of a true hero is shown by the support given by many people.
The MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a pack of Bellator 206s but you don't get to see the main event.
The San Jose account contained 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to meet, viewers in the UK were again stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were slightly impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours specifically for the match.
A Twitter fan described the change to the children's comic as "a kind of sick joke".
"It's a public regulation that at 6pm if the content wasn't appropriated, they had to switch to the kids' program", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communications, when asked about the transfer.
The Peppa Pig, yeah.
Bellator's president Scott Coker said they will work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can figure it out", Coker said.
But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we won't find out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, as it went on, there were a lot of texts that went back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, but we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We're going to do five games instead of six -- which we usually do -- and we're trying to pass it on to the fans, and we just passed.
It's a very unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "underprivileged" because of his sexuality
The Olympic downhill skier Tom Daley says that growing up he felt worse than anyone because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that everybody was like me.
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about his gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
What could look like a lost cause in Laverne's first program, Daly said he felt less than everyone else who grew up because it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.
He said, "To this day, feeling less than myself and feeling different are the only things that have given me real strength and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "nothing", he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a professional LGBT campaigner and used her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without prejudice and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man -- the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- surprised me.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
When you go through so much at such a young age -- he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find anyone in his same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his whole perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, 'Shop all you want, I need to win a gold medal,'" he said.
You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his dad didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 -- when he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, where fans don't feel any better", he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Stolt by Heather Small - which had vibrated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and gave him still goose bumps.

Out of shape, Mickelson sits on the bench at the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to turn his form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's game of fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time major winner splits his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game within reach in the hope of correcting what's bothering him.
Never the most competent long-shooter, even not at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting long-shots on the tight, French main course, where balls hit the outside if the golfer is not accurate with the stroke.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth game Sunday, the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, four points down from the start of the 12 singles matches, get off to a warm start, Mickelson's match could be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, not that he could say much else.
"He understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably wouldn't have thought he played two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we were going to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite matched his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his proximity added some immaterial qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's entertaining, he likes to have fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the storage room", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun having a session with him this week, too, which was fun to watch.
He's contributing much more than just playing.
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead on the way into the final day's singles of the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant journey.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros kept a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the goal line with the nose leading by the narrowest margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far", said Bjørn, after watching Klasse 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone at that time that this is not over.
You're going to the grand opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you have the score on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've been saying all along, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's on the other side -- the biggest players in the world.
Pleased with his players' performances on a tough golf course, Bjørn added: "I would never take the win on the lead.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, it's the individual achievements that come up, and that's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're put to the test of your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message you need to convey to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he has to go and get the best out of himself too.
In contrast to Bjørn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been in both ends of the turnover operations on the last few days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he finished as a loser when Europe pulled out of the Miracle in Medinah.
"I remember every fucking word of it", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered his players on the way into the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.
When that moment goes away, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle struggles.
We set up our corresponding line-up and get the guys going in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the match and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way through", Bjorn said of his waves of singles.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be ordered in 2014 to replace ageing warships from the Cold War, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and staggering costs, local media reported.
The launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the troubling problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from the home ports.
Nevertheless, continuous wrongdoing means that the groundbreaking warships, which supposedly allowed Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be outdated when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125-fregatte made headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of important software and hardware errors that made the warship unusable if it was deployed on a combat mission.
Software errors were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships were to be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half the workforce of older Bremen frigates.
It also proved to be dramatically overweight, reducing performance and limiting the ability of the fleet to add to future upgrades.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including training of the crew - is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial €2.2 billion (EURO)
The problems associated with the newest frigates are particularly important in light of the recent warnings that Germany's fleet power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence select committee, acknowledged that the fleet had virtually ended its distribution-competent ships.
The officer said the problem has built up over time, because old ships were decommissioned, but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust investigates the secret life of the bat
New research being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to uncover how the flagger mice use the landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton flagger mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track flaggermus activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flaggermuss calls and which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural science advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat, natural homes, are most important for the flagger mice and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management activities such as the acquisition of grasslands and how best to maintain forest areas for flagger mice and other associated species.
Flaggermus populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are the result of construction and development work that affects resting places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flying paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet birds.
The bat is not actually blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to detect errors and obstacles in their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the flaggermuses very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, rest areas inspections and sometimes save lives.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated flaggermus reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flaggermus species.
Property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threave we have a great area for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there's still a lot about flag mice that we don't know, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive. 
He stresses the importance of checking for flagger mice before carrying out maintenance within properties, since it is possible that the endless destruction of a single buplass could kill up to 400 female flagger mice and young, and perhaps exterminate a whole local population.
Flagger mice are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flag mice and for too many of our species, we don't know how their populations are going".
Ronaldo rejects allegations of violence in lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the violence charges against him as "fake news", and says people "want to highlight themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live Instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, tells his 142 million followers just hours after the allegations, that the allegations are fake news.
No, no, no, no, no, no. This is not a game.
What they said today, fake news, says five times the Golden Ball winner in front of the camera.
They want to market themselves by using my name.
That is normal.
They want to be known for saying my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine, " the player said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions within the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for moral damage in an amount that reflects the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
The mayor claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was 99 percent a good guy and failed by one percent.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
The mayor also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but was later agreed to a settlement because she felt "scared of retaliation" and was concerned about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to change her residence as she continues to be traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain will regret it forever if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, has business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was because Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the effect of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My perception is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we'll see production stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnaston.
Other British carmakers have raised fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern is what the car manufacturers say is the supply chain risk in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a just-in-time basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars that are ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Checkers plan for future relations with the EU is nettopp calibrated to avoid border controls.
"We need to have a deal. We want the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy today's success, but for us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's daytime program.
The proof from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but on a longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite union at the plant, said his members are more concerned with: According to my experience, once these jobs go, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be pushed back a week as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will resign the general's office or not, and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence, has been a source of suspicion for Washington for months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing a guide to recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But Monday before he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "take steps" not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the Senate committee hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "There's no date set yet. It could be this week, but I can see and imagine it will be delayed another week because of everything else that's happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated. 
Some reporters will probably disagree: Sanders has not held a press orientation for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of orientations was not due to a dissatisfaction with TV reporters' performance for the gallery, although she said: I don't disagree with their performance.
She also mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president is holding more press conferences than any president has ever done", she said, "without providing any evidence to support the claim".
Sanders says that updates will still happen, but if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it a little bit, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press conference if you can talk directly to the President of the United States. 
Trump is always welcome to ask questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated why, by speaking to reporters shamelessly, almost bizarrely.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit fears to EU workers at NHS in Scotland
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU workers working on the NHS in Scotland to express his gratitude and wish for their continued success after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even though there are less than six months left before the United Kingdom leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to taking on the costs of applications that have status as determined for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote the following: During the summer, negotiations concerning the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union have continued, and the expected conclusion is approaching in the autumn.
However, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I would now like to reiterate the high value I place on the contributions of all employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and are beneficial to patients and society.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we'd like you to stay. 
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays for the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent an acute operation after suffering a head injury in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennessean.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, kind of", Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official spokesman for Tennessee State told WSMV that Abercrombie was finished operating at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There are no details on the extent of the damage yet, Harris said, adding that Tennessee State is still trying to determine when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie is in his second year at the university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had five total tackles before he was injured in Saturday's game, and is now up to 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when they buy property in the UK, and the extra income will be used to help the homeless, according to the Conservative government's new plans.
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in documentation fees will be added to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK, with the extra income going to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young, well-earning voters, with the promise of affordable housing.
The increase in the document fee will be added to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of omnibuses.
The tax, which is in addition to the current document tax, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago on number two and rented homes, which can be as much as three percent.
The state treasury expects the decision to raise up to £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of new homes in London are bought by residents outside the UK, which makes prices higher and it harder for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - particularly the capital - have become ghost towns due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson wanted to cut the documentation fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He appealed to large construction firms to keep prices high by getting hold of properties but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing shame".
Corbyn has announced a series of unprecedented proposals for housing reforms, including controlled rent and the end of unjustified evictions.
He will give the council greater power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
That means fixing the ruined housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Yet it can't be fair that it should be as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, or foreign companies, to buy homes as it is for hardworking, British citizens.
For many people, the dream of a home has become too far away, and the humility of being a stranger is real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate ambition is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scots (42) are looking forward to the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east, currently in third place in League One, just three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, having led St Mirren back to the Scottish elite series in the previous season.
I wanted to play for my country that plays.
I got a B-team match, and that was it", Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hamden with my father, and there's always been something that's pulled me back.
That opportunity can only come if I have success as a club manager.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he has not been anxious to come after so many established names in such a big club, as he has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For the moment, my success will be measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
"Based on the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong at home in the Premier League", he said.
It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club back there.
Ross is just three years into his career as manager, following a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in Hearts' training.
He then helped Alloa to come from relegation to third level, and transformed St Mirren, who were on the way to relegation, into championship winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did when he was playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a fork in the road", he says of leading Alloa.
I honestly thought being a manager suited me a lot better than being a player.
So it sounds strange, because I did well, I earned well, and I liked it fairly well.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still feel that when it comes to the stress and pressure of the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now I am, and it's the most comfortable thing I've ever felt in my own body in my entire adult life.
On Sunday 30 September you can hear the full interview on Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13 o'clock.
Research shows that the perfect time for a half liter is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the intake of struggling pubs in the UK, but also increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, the children's food industry saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales, but the restaurant industry saw a 4.8 percent decline, the statistics show.
Business adviser Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: "The current sun, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern of June when pubs went up 2.8 percent, only restaurants were hit even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars that sell liquor, did it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs, which sell food, noticed the decline in sunlight, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the number of drinks had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food prices had fallen by three percent.
Paul Newman, travel and leisure analyst at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trend we've seen since late April.
Weather, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will continue to be the biggest factors in the outdoor sales.
It's no surprise that the restaurant industry will continue to struggle. A decline in sales of 4.8 percent annually would be hard to come by on top of ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators who operate with food, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can provide a prolonged respite.
The total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the number of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry's sales monitor, collects and analyses the results of 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, the established industry's benchmark.
One in five kids have secret social media profiles that they hide from their parents.
One in five kids -- some as young as 11 -- have secret social media profiles that they hide from parents and teachers, a new study shows.
A survey of 20 000 students at higher education reveals an increase in falske Insta profiles
This news has raised fears about the posting of sexual content.
20% of the students say they have a "main" profile that they show their parents.
One in five children -- some as young as 11 -- create social media profiles that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20 000 secondary school students revealed a sharp increase in fake Insta profiles - a reference to the photo-sharing platform Instagram.
The news has increased fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a sterile head profile that they show to parents, while also having private profiles.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) at various schools, found that 40 per cent of those between 11 and 18 years old had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
Mike Buchanan, the CEO of HMC, said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create sites on the web where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle becomes the voice of the athlete in the Scottish Freedom Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Freedoms as non-executive director at the Board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated freestyle athlete in Scotland, and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level during the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected across Scotland, the UK and the world's freedoms community, and we are sure that the freedoms of Scotland can benefit from having her in the government", Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to serve as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can be a part of helping and supporting the sport in Scotland".
The American, who has golds from both the 200m and 400m at Atlanta in 1996 among his four Olympic golds and is now a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to go after a drop.
On Twitter, he wrote: Today is a month since I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could tell me if I would get better, or how well.
It's been exhausting work, but I've recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing flexibility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
Internet divided over breast pump advertisements comparing mothers to milk cows
A breast pump company has divided the Internet with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to milk bottles.
To mark what is described as the world's first silent, sitting breast pump, the technology company Elvie released a small-scale advertisement inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives mothers who produce milk.
Four real mothers dance in a crowded cow-dance, to a song that includes lyrics like: Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail and If you haven't noticed, these aren't puppies, these are my dolls.
The refrain goes, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
The ad, which is posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77 000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlights the "horror" of the dairy industry.
Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and feed to produce milk, only the calves are entrusted to them only days after birth, one writes.
Elvie's breast pump is discreet in a breast-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: Understandably traumatic enough for both mother and child
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?
Another added: "For a far-fetched advertisement".
Others defended the advertisement, and one lady admitted that she thought the sound was festleg.
I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This is a genius product, wrote one.
Another commented: This is a funny advertisement directed at mothers who pump (often at work or on the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not a commercial boasting or judging of the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they all danced with the discreet pump wrapped in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump, say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely quiet, has no pipes or conduits, and is discreet inside a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their children, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director at Mother, commented: "Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and milk-milkers, we want to shine a light on breast pumping and the challenges it brings, and at the same time demonstrate the incredible freedom that this new pump will bring, in a fun and recognizable way.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, wearing the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to camp at the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in prison has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the strict policy the Trump administration has introduced makes it more difficult to place the children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and taking in a child could threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk of it increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would be forced to submit fingerprints, and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Earlier this week, Matthew Albence of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service testified for Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to sponsor single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had nothing on their rullebladet from before.
Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a large portion of these are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to continue to persecute these people", Albence said.
According to the camp's staff, new rules have been introduced to handle the children, requiring some of them to appear in court before a month has passed, compared to 60 days earlier.
Many will participate via videoconference rather than in person, to have their case tried before an immigration judge.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape temptations, say camp officials.
Spokesmen say these concerns are greater at large facilities such as Tornillo, where the size of the facility makes it more likely that children's signs of fatigue are overlooked.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or expressing hatred of friends, can amplify traumas that many already suffer from.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked that Syrian refugees return home, even though the country is now at war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who serves as vice-president, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and will be dealt with accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without preconditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to fight a holy battle until all Syrian territory has been cleared of both terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence.
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily for training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
When it came to the refugee problem, Moualem said it was safe for them to return, and he blamed some western countries for spreading irrational fears about the surroundings that kept refugees away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return", he said.
They're making policy out of what should be a purely humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
Diplomats from the United Nations say a recently concluded agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created a possibility to press ahead with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed however that the agreement had "clearer time limits" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Nusra front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war law for Syria, paving the way for elections.
Moualem set out the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why is Trump going to win a term of
With that logic, Trump will win reelection in 2020 if, as many liberal observers likely hope, his presidency does not end early due to scandals and impeachment.
That would be, without a doubt, the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!
At the time of writing, there are no signs that viewers have grown tired.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has nearly tripled its rating to 1.6 million.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in its prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show tops the cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a fire that people are lured by, because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, former comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh", he replied, according to Scovell.
There is entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families get together and the health of the global economy.
To turn off the screens is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth class watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "profoundly informed" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich jacket ("a garment thick with arrogance", the Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's gruesome description of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
Personally, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, daily manager at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the show's dealings with Trump's employees and daily disputes (going into a game with the NFL, rose Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you're not going to hang around.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sunny outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting in there watching MSNBC while he was taping CNN.
He couldn't turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows back in the day and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization,'" Fleiss said.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Money from the outside is pouring into the tightest midterm election.
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is seeing an abundance of money, thanks to a congressional redistricting that has seen two sitting members fight for the same seat.
The recent suburb of Pittsburg was won by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is fighting another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing Pennsylvania's 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition for the 17th district has set in motion a weapon drawing on the financing of the campaigns, between the major parties' money arsenal, the Democratic Congress Committee and the Republican Congress Committee.
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a brief victory in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners threw out the Trump organization's leadership group.
The secretaries of state decided to bring back the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions not to recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, punishment was only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The alleged penalties, which included cuts to economic support and targeted restrictions on visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top administrators announced that they wanted the conference to continue, and therefore put a stop to the review of the punishment for El Salvador.
It has now been announced that Vice President Mike Pence will attend the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the importance the administration places on the gathering, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A Bolton spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the assumption of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the administration and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Studying history
Special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice is awaited, as there is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller is said to have turned the focus of the investigation to whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia to attack our election.
If Congress were to change its board of directors, Trump would have to stand at the head of this body, in which he prepares to convince voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There's a lot of debate, and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, or his European counterpart's.
There are choices to be made for all of us on both sides of the pond, which will affect how long the fight may be.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler, had only the West stood in his way and helped the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that this would entail.
The course of history revolves around such a turning point, and democracy's implacable march is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing many of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on deep water ever since this newspaper revealed that he last year proposed to eavesdrop on the president in secret, and speculated that he was unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
How will we react if the recently-committed FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair  or is accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I have my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me out of curiosity to light the Sabbath candle on the table that had the swastika.
If this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of the Rapid Vienna game
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the fight believing we could get something, and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could take it towards the end, but overall it's a draw probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and it was a better team.
Thursday is another big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game. They had a good result in their first game, but with the crowd behind us I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result.
This last year has definitely been tough, with everything that's happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now I feel fine.
The stable is good and the boys are doing well; the training is good.
Hopefully we can continue, put the past season behind us and be successful.
Women are losing sleep over this fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that participants in one study had clear ideas about how they would be cared for, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in a survey from Nationwide said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation", says Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not make your wishes known in the meantime.
Work with a counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a big part of determining the costs.
Get a financial advisor: Your financial advisor may help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a cash value life insurance to help pay the costs, or that you insure yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Make legal paperwork: avoid legal battles before they start.
Get a health authority in place, so that you can appoint a person you trust to oversee your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you can't communicate.
You can also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You should choose someone you trust to make your financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you don't have the option yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your old grandparent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all these details in a written plan, so you're done.
"It's not just about the finances, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What kind of medication is that?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready.
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while on his way home from a trip to the city.
The victim, aged in his 40s, was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Politicians describe the shooting, which occurred around 02.30 local time, as an "accidental act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Without the ability to communicate, aid workers have not received any information from Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a region of more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and gardening are the mainstays of the economy of central Sulawesi, particularly the Donggala coastal region.
Nikkel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Risk Reduction Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the western side of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that sweeps into the southern coast and kills nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of approximately 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh and causes devastation and panic as people remember the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 people lost their lives due to collapsed buildings.
2018: A major earthquake hits the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested and charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested, charged with assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in domestic violence reporting and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the crime.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su prison, with a $500 bail bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded guilty to the charges, the network reported.
Palin faces three misdemeanor counts of Class A, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a misdemeanor class B, punishable by a day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up in the veteran court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with assault in the home, interference in a reporting of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had alleged that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after a massive earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake, with a magnitude of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the dramatic moment of the quake are flourishing on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors want the rare death penalty for New York terror suspects
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack that claimed the lives of eight people -- a rare sentence that hasn't been carried out for a federal crime in that state since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a Home Depot rental car to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along West Side Highway in lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "willfully" and that he "willfully" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notarized report filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events could be the basis for a possible death penalty, the court document states.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 indictments, including eight for murder with the intent of money laundering, commonly used by federal prosecutors in connection with organized crime, and one for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and deliberation", the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's conduct as "abominable, cruel and destructive".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, it is stated in the note.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York has passed a death penalty case.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death penalty was carried out in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was famously good, the police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing videos of ISIS on his phone, the indictment said.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag on the hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of the incident for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defendants had earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Nigel Farage thinks Brexit negotiations should be held
Nigel Farage promised to mobiliser the people's army today, during a protest at the Tory country meeting.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians had to "feel the pressure" from eurosceptics as one of Theresa May's parliament members suggested he should hold negotiations with the EU.
The conservative, powerful parliamentarian Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that Britain would be out now if Farage was Brexit minister.
The challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underscored by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who want to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggled to keep the Chequers compromise on track after attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insist that she will press for an agreement with Brussels, despite the backlash  and force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her pack and chaos.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave group in Solihull that he wished to forget Chequers
He suggested that Farage should be given noble rank and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had won, we'd be out of here now", he said.
The Member of Parliament for Wellingborough, added: "I want to fight for Brexit, but we have to reject Chequers".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said, "We don't fight these world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone denies the claim that the opinion of the people has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and wish to remain is completely untrue".
Tory Brexit campaigner Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, telling reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
Chequers are not popular with the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Please drop the Chequers and hear from me later
In a message to May, she adds: "State ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage said politicians must be made aware of the heat if they are to come to terms with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let them get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to make the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, the Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives for security problems they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a total farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to take a closer look at running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take a "careful look" at running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is up for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was a member of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the focus of much speculation that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The incident in Holyoke on Saturday was her 36th meeting with voters in a city hall since Trump's inauguration.
A participant asked if she had any plans to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to march on Washington to fix our government that is broken, and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrest made in the shooting of Louisiana State University player Sims
The Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At 11:00 local time, the police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen on the video.
Sims (20) was shot and killed early Friday on the university's southern site.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result of it, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, 247sports reported.
Wayde went in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In his deposition, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene, armed, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without drama and placed in custody by the police department in eastern Baton Rouge.
A nearly two-meter, three-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games, 10 of them as a starter last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team was going to play a big role in the race.
Bottas got a good start on the race, and let Hamilton take care of himself in that he defended his position the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was first in the depot and let Hamilton enter the traffic back in the run, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes drove into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ended up in front after a bit of side-by-side action which made the Ferrari driver reluctant to let the inside be free in danger of not being able to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, on the back row and was seventh at the end of the first round.
After that, he led large parts of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of driving past Kimi Raikkonen who was fourth.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase his pace the last eight rounds while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job, having both first and second place", Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election rally Saturday for insisting that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony Ford had given to the Senate Commission directly, but commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and bad and bad and bad and bad".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in these last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and uncomfortable and they're lying", he said.
When you look at publications and leaks and you say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you paint it?
Did you remember her answer -- did you cover the document -- oh, what?
Oh, no. This is a very good idea.
I didn't paint it.
Wait a second.
Let's... no, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not, let's not.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked.
But her denial didn't sit well with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election rally: "I'm telling you, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen. 
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been indicted for sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
They are determined to take back power by any means they see fit.
You see the badness, the fellowship, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control, the president said according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3) They are the defending champions
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars compensated for their loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants were early targets of attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied before Dwyer once again sent the Giants in the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third defeat in the league this season for Adam Keefe's boys, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, with the Giants winning their last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute after an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford served an assist to Beauvillier who doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan got the home run back in the game in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt made the Cownie equaliser in the 16th.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead into the break when he scored his second goal of the evening on the first-half tampon.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard again secured a tie with a brilliant goal after 27 minutes of play.
Late in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen take the lead for the first time in the match, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, face Milton Keynes at home in their next game, which is on Friday.
Flight attendants die trying to ensure that hundreds of passengers escape earthquakes
An Indonesian flight attendant is being hailed as a hero after he lost his life in the pursuit of a plane with hundreds of passengers safely in the air.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disturb the area, and many are trapped in wreckage in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, even though it was a wild turn.
He stayed behind to make sure the Batik Air Flight 6321 took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower, thinking it collapsed.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in a bigger city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll will rise to thousands, while the country's crisis relief agency says access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of dead is increasing while we find bodies trapped under buildings, many of which we cannot reach", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves of up to six metres have devastated Palu, which is due to host a mass grave on Sunday.
Naval aid comes with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with multiple bodies.
Clean water is hard to find.
The shops have been robbed.
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find when they get there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and told the military in the country: I ask you all to work around the clock to do everything you can to help with the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake in Lombok, killing 550 people.
Air Niugini reports missing man after lagoon crash
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific reports that a man is missing, having earlier stated that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, it did not know where the male passenger was.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not provide further details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped to rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land on the Chuuk island.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people have been sent to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers managed to swim through the water, which brought them back to life, to the emergency exits of the plane before it sank.
He said the crew panicked and screamed, and he suffered a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said sailors nearby, who were working to improve a quay, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat they used to transport passengers to land before the plane sank at about 30 feet.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines' aircraft in the last 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts are creating a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution presented all evidence on Saturday during the ongoing trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The US Justice Department's analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he shuffled together recordings from cell phones to find out what happened the night Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the accused, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have used localisation data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to what Tellis had previously explained.
When the location data showed that Tellis's cell phone was with Chambers's mobile at the same time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he "stole because my car was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their cell phone bills showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a moment after Chambers died, Tellis' messages, conversations and Chambers' contact information were leaked from his cell phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense will close the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio will challenge the music genre's negative reputation by filling their music with positive thoughts.
The High Breed from Bristol, England, says hip hop has moved away from the original political idea of tackling social problems.
They want to go back to their hip hop roots and make the conscious version of the genre popular again.
The Fugees of Common have become more popular again in the UK through the artists Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York childcare system sues couple for firing after rasistic text message
A New York babysitter sues a couple for firing her based on discrimination after she received a faulty text message from her mother complaining that she was married to a black person.
The couple has denied being racist, and compared the lawsuit to utpressing.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was dissatisfied to see that her childminder, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at work for the first time in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, ONLY ONE BLACK PERSON", Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband, who was also a black man.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to the babysitter Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the unfit Plasco-Flaxman gave the babysitter Maurice the boot, saying that the previous babysitter, who was African-American, had done a poor job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work before they sent her home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for her firing, asking for $350 a day for six months for the job she should have had, even though it was without a contract, where she was to live with her family.
"I want to show them that it's not right to do that", she told The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know that's discrimination".
The couple have denied being racist, saying that firing Maurice was the only thing they could do after insulting her, fearing revenge.
My wife had sent her something that she didn't mean to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racist", her husband Joel Plasco told The New York Post.
But would you let someone who you have abused look after your children, even if you didn't mean to hurt them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.
Plasco compared the prosecution to "pressing", and said his wife was seven months pregnant and in a "very difficult situation".
Would you really attack a person in a situation like this?
That's not a nice thing to do", said the investor Plasco.
While the case was ongoing, the public was quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid that people wouldn't like a talking bear, a new letter reveals
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the first book's approval, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's really funny to see how successful Paddington became.
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about the teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected, adding that she had mixed feelings about the book's 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
As for Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was proud of his success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he never bragged", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who accomplished something: you're proud of them even though you're not really behind it.
I think he saw his Paddington success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to make it", said Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called to say that she was going to die within the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be right there.
The medicines the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly leaving her system.
She was already dead and her body was in the process of decomposing.
I just sat there, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry out, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it all inside.
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
"Nobody knew anything", she said.
I sat with my head bowed while tears fell.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women hang banners on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached a note to a bridge in Wales that will inspire people who are thinking of committing suicide to change their minds and call the number on the note.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to struggle with depression and took his own life at 18.
I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smiling face.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up every room.
But before he died, he stopped working, because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after he took his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still worried that my little brother may have been affected by Tyler's death".
Davis wrote the notes so people know that there are other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone  you need to talk to someone.
Humphreys, who has been Davis' friend for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was sad or depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed that he started to behave differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts he didn't even look at them.
She said that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continue to work through the trauma: There is a big void in our family now.
We are devastated.
But we all have to fight to survive.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought if we actually got something like what he's asking about, a restricted investigation, maybe we could get some solitude", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee would collapse in the middle of a partisan back-lock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They're holding back because of the timing.
The midterm elections in the United States are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans don't do well, this will make it difficult for them to elect Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called on senators to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley that way, then Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI presents their report?
They're going to vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh will be able to gather at least 50 Senate votes, which will allow Vice President Mike Pense to confirm him in the Senate.
The number of North Korean defectors is declining under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said there were 1127 defectors last year, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter borders between North Korea and China and higher smuggling fees are the main reasons for the decline.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
Most North Korean defectors are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as illegal immigrants and not refugees, and often sends them back by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the nuclear arms embargo.
These talks follow the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for not achieving anything since then.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot lower our weapons first", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he cannot serve on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he has too much temperament to serve in the US Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate bench Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh's opening remarks, he was very emotional and sometimes cried with a lump in his throat while talking about his family and the years of continuing.
He criticized the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque" and a planned assassination of his reputation, organized by liberal politicians who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot serve on the Supreme Court because it shows that he has prejudice against Democrats.
"I think the way he's behaving disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi made an objection when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to resign if he is elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats achieve majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this: If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he can't serve on the Supreme Court, or even the court he's serving on now", Pelosi added.
Kavanaugh is a judge on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat, she is concerned about potential judges from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe v. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great", Pelosi said.
And women must wield their swords
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high position at a company, who said she cried when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she cried, "You might think I'm sorry because I cried.
I'm mad. 
And then she just keeps going.
I think that was brilliant.
Tears are a way of expressing your thoughts, but they are often misunderstood.
In one of my strongest memories from my previous job, when most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I was getting angry, and a woman who was older than me grabbed me by the neck -- she was a cold leader that I had always been terrified of -- and she pulled me out into the hallway.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're bored and they won because they made you cry.
Patricia Schroeder, a congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was caught cheating on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought she could as well run for president herself.
"I didn't really think about it well enough", she told me laughing, 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates running, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Some called the situation "Snøkvit and the seven dwarfs".
Since the campaign had already been going on for some time, she had not raised enough money, so she promised that she would only do so if she managed to raise $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she asked.
When she declared she would not run anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target the voters instead of the delegates, and anger at the gender discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown", Schroeder said of how the press reacted when she wrote.
You'd think that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I think I was thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
What branch?
How could a US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening salves of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and while the battle continues, a rift between the two countries may be an advantage for Beijing over time, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired his first shot this year at taxing important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on items worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has retaliated by imposing tariffs of between five and ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States for every shot they fire, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to go down with the first.
To get Washington to join, China has to do what the United States wants, but to bow to the United States is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cool, the US pressure could have a positive effect on Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political move in Washington or Beijing could cause both economies to collapse is more dangerous than people have dared to admit earlier", said Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to accept refugees who wish to return voluntarily, and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country was making progress.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal areas.
All the necessary conditions are in place for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were forced to travel to due to terrorism and one-sided economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they will not accept assistance or help with terms from countries that sponsor the uprising.
Europe secures victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they haven't won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown in that team's Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American Phil Mickelson, who was the star of the tournament, hit the ball into the water from the tee at hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari was a consistent performer in all of his rounds and is one of only four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5&4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Dane Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest ranking, was 2 and 1 behind Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the most successful European with 25.5 points in his career.
Normally I don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas chose me and believes in me.
I'm so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help", an emotional Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the staff to fellow American John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel a huge pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", Rahm (23) said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup record throughout his career.
A strange statistic from one of the world's best players, who has won 14 major titles and is beaten only by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairway throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, spoke after a disappointing performance from his team. "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an exceptional captain
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
One must take off the hat.
We were all confused.
Dinoflagellate updates: Reduced concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from Florida's Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a general decline in the concentration of dinoflagellates in the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, uneven growth is reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - suggesting a decrease in concentration.
A growth of dinoflagellates extends over approximately 200 km of coastline from northern Pinellas County to the southern counties of Lee County.
Dinoflagellated areas are found approximately 16 km off the coast at Hillsborough, but compared to previous weeks, there are fewer areas.
Dinoflagellates have been observed in Pasco.
There have been reports of medium-to-high concentrations in Pinellas County the past week, low to high concentrations along the coast in Hillsborough, low concentrations in Manatee, high concentrations along the coast in Sarasota, medium-to-high concentrations in Charlotte, high concentrations in Lee and low concentrations in Collier.
Irritation of the airways is still reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No airway irritation was reported in northwest Florida last week.
