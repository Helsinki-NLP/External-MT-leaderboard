Did you get to convince Fadil?
I'm talking about him.
Don't worry, I'll stay with you.

Can I go with him?
He stepped forward.

The elephant has a long nose.
Sami was upset.
Sami hit Layla and knocked her unconscious.
All the teachers were here.
Those are her shoes.

It's a fake.
Don't you remember him?
Tom is waiting for a response.
The sun shone on the hills.
Sami was subject to a life sentence.
He speaks English with a German accent.
I can send you my Amazon dictionary.

What is it, Tom's car?
Most of the leaves have fallen.
The hospital opened last month.

"Tatoeba" means "for example" in Japanese.
I think he's right.
Have someone else do it, please.
Japanese people like to travel in groups.
Wait for me in my office.
I see what you mean.
We were just talking .
Let's have a look.
You're in my way.
This bus will take you to the airport.
He was wearing a blue jacket.

I hope to see you again.
We don't have to do this every day.
Sami's car hit a bus stop.
I have a cat and a dog.

When did the meeting end?
The dense fog made it difficult to see the road.
Take your time, Yoshida.
It wasn't her!
She said not to touch me.
Sami came to the clinic to meet Layla.
I better ask her.

Anyway, that's not the important thing.
May I ask, where are you going?
It's Tom's turtle. Her name is Mary.
I wish summer never ends.
