Right-wing populists win in Austria, with a total of 29 percent
The two parties in the grand coalition have weakened and the right-wing populist parties have gained momentum, according to preliminary results of the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, has been seriously shaken, suffered a particularly heavy loss.
In contrast, the president of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (AFA), the governor of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country remains the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the vote, but it has lost 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last election in 2006.
The PPE fared even worse, losing 25.6% of the vote to almost nine percent.
These are the worst results for both major parties in Austria's postwar history, and especially for the People's Party, which has called for early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the SPÖ had a significant advantage over the SPÖ according to public opinion polls.
But the voters have visibly punished him for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of party leader and current chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
This development would likely facilitate the increasingly likely exit from the election result, namely the renewal of the SPÖ/ÖVP grand coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) had previously won 18% of the vote and the BZÖ 11% - the Social Democrats also voiced their fears about a repeat of 1999, when the PP agreed to a joint government with the populists (the FPÖ was still united at the time, having split from the BZÖ in 2005), which even led to sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already declared his willingness to cooperate with any party and I assume he can return to Vienna to national politics, obviously expects this solution.
The Greens also gained seats in parliament, but their popularity has somewhat declined, falling from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties have passed the four percent mark and made it to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: India's relations with Russia may cool
If the problem of Czech scientists being charged with illegal insect collection is not resolved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said a certain chill in Czech-Indian relations could occur.
The minister made the announcement after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee in New York today.
"If this is not resolved, yes, there will be a certain cooling off", he said after the meeting, which was organised at the Czech instigation.
Mukherjee said after the trial that the executive branch has a hard time intervening in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local authorities in Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction the case falls.
"His problem could be solved", said the minister.
However, for Emil Kucera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said it would be best to appeal to the Supreme Court.
He said he could then apply for bail and be free to await sentencing.
Schwarzenberg testified that his partner made similar statements during the trial.
"He offered to appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to acquit him", said the head of the Czech diplomatic service.
The only way the Czech side could intervene in the whole matter was to provide "competent legal assistance" to the convict, the Indian minister mentioned.
However, he said that the Indian side was already providing them with such assistance.
"Our primary interest is to maintain the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians recognize this", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider it a serious mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists", he said.
The Minister avoided answering the question whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I've already received a fair amount of promises", he noted.
Czech judges in the fight for seabed rights
He goes to the wall electronic map showing Australia and the surrounding sea areas.
But it's not the continent that interests him. It's a dot that disappears into the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is the size of the continent itself", says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the 30-member staff of the UN Division of Ocean and Maritime Law.
Its head, Czech lawyer Vaclav Mikulka, director of the division, monitors the explanation, which he sometimes adds.
There's a lot of work and enthusiasm here.
The seabed holds a world rich in natural resources that has been little known.
These include oil, ores and other minerals, but also previously unknown living organisms that could be key to the development of drugs against cancer, for example.
Sea beds larger than land
Coastal states are now aggressively bidding for new undersea areas.
They are entitled to their rights under the UN Convention, which was agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is primarily an area of the so-called continental shelf, often extending several hundred kilometers from the shores of a country.
Such a country has the exclusive right under the Convention to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In simple terms, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and the bottom layer that is a natural continuation of the sub-sea continental shelf.
The coastal sea borders, often 200 nautical miles, extend beyond the boundary of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country to the Committee for the External Limits of the Continental Shelf shall be accompanied by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurements.
It's the result of years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the committee.
The Commission has so far examined five applications, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded", adds Mikulka.
The world has recently been struck by the success of Australia, which was the first to significantly expand its undersea country.
But New Zealand also won - the seabed area the committee assigned to it is about 1.6 million square kilometers, or six times the size of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The benefits of future use of the seabed are hopefully invaluable.
Other countries are continuing to submit applications.
They shall do so within 10 years of the date of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor begins, an area declared by the Convention to be "the common heritage of mankind".
No country is exclusive here anymore.
The right to extract in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed is not the Klondike", says Director Mikulka, exaggerating that "some of its areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contracted".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now part of the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the former Eastern Bloc under the joint Interoceanmetal organisation.
The organisation was granted the status of 'pioneer investor' under the Convention in 1991, in common with investors from several other countries.
Licensed to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area surveyed by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is broken, the Tatra is a kind of undersea replica.
"This is a total of 75,000 square kilometers of land that can be mined.
The area is rich in polymetallic minerals, including nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese", notes another lawyer, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides another concrete example.
It's like a potato or a little imagination, like a parchment with magic words that brought the Golem to life.
German special forces were present at the hostage rescue
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis, and the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces were ready, but they were not deployed.
More and more details are emerging about the rescue of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, German special forces were also involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, in addition to the specialists of the German Federal Army, the staff of the GSG 9, the German Federal Police Air Force, and the Federal Criminal Bureau, as well as logistics experts of the German Technical Service were also present at the rescue site.
Ministry spokesmen said Monday night that German forces were not needed, however, because the hostage takers let their prisoners escape and then fled when they recognized signs of a violent hostage situation.
The Egyptian Government has accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve it as a ground support force.
"Fortunately, this did not happen", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of tourists, consisting of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts, in southern Egypt on September 19.
After a kidnapping in the desert of southern Egypt, hostages were dragged back and forth across the borders of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers remains unclear, as are the details of the hostage rescue or possible ransom payments.
The survivors have meanwhile arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier has informed us that the hostages are under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't give details of his release.
Berlin has not yet given any information about when they will return to Germany.
According to the daily Bild, the five tourists and the special forces will arrive in Germany on Tuesday on an Airbus of the German Air Force.
The U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the bailout package.
The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly defeated a proposed $700 billion bailout for financial markets.
The Dow Jones has plummeted.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted 227 to 206 to reject the government's bailout of the financial markets.
Despite calls from President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, the program to curb the chaos in financial markets has not won a majority.
The backers tried desperately to convince critics of the need for the $700 billion package in a dramatic move.
Barney Frank, a Democratic Party negotiator, has called on Congress to back the plan, even if it's unpopular.
"It's hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn't happened yet", he admitted.
The Dow Jones has fallen more than 6 percent, or 600 points, since the vote.
Investors were concerned that the state rescue package might fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, only to fall again after the failure was made public.
Experts expect further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
The programme shall require the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate for it to enter into force.
The directors are registering more and more bookings.
A good winter is in store for German tour operators.
One study found that the number of bookings for the following months increased significantly from the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the study found that the desire of Germans to travel has not diminished.
Travel agencies saw a 31 percent increase in winter season bookings compared with the same period last year, the German Travel Association (DRV) said in Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK market research institute, the number of bookings is already higher in the autumn months.
Travel agencies' October traffic was 11 percent higher than in October 2007, according to the DRV.
These results are based on GfK's data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and extrapolates them to the entire market.
The Institute took into account the trips booked up to the end of August 2008.
The weak dollar meant that travel to the United States was particularly sought after, the DRV said.
The booking rate here has gone up by a third.
Germany's favourite destinations are Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as its home countryside.
The most popular are organized routes, said Klaus Laepple, president of DRV.
The increase in energy and food costs means that the costs of organised trips are 'better calculated for passengers than for individual organised trips'.
Passengers can save money, among other things, with pre-booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The summer months also saw very good booking rates, which will again boost traffic compared to the previous year - although another study found fewer German tourists taking trips than the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
The endlessly repeating ballermann hits, the gallons of beer and the design-driven celebrities.
Debut with Wiesne.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, she's a TV host, and she wears a custom-made turtleneck.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and I got my dress at the flea market.
But one thing we have in common: We've only been in Wiesne for three minutes, and the photographers are already chasing us and filling up their memory cards - very flattering, and this is my first visit to Wiesne.
That's how we make friends.
Looks like the cheap dirndl is serving its purpose.
As a native Wiesn tourist north of the equator, my sense of comfort is still limited by folk manners.
But when we get to Theresienwiese, it's not so bad.
Almost everyone is wearing a turban or leather pants; no one is looking at me with a frown or embarrassment - everything is perfectly fine.
The only strange look at the chocolate banana stand is my dirndl apron.
A woman in Munich points out that I tied the cape wrong: "Tie it on the left, you're free, in the middle a virgin, on the right, a widow in the back".
I secretly tied the mast from the back to the left.
"That's it", he says, and he laughs.
Others make less of a fuss about subtle flirting techniques, wearing simple felt boards that say "I'm too drunk to get dressed" and showing off their naked buttocks uninvited.
The young man with the exhibitionist features is named Bob, and he was also a first-time Oktoberfest visitor.
Which he finds very fantastic, with a long "aaaaa".
All this after he's gotten rid of the contents of his old jug.
Right next to one of the fire hydrants that everyone thinks is a garbage dump.
So Bob is one of the infamous "no pee pee" types.
Others are not so fortunate to get rid of alcohol in this way.
By 8:00 p.m., an army of paramedics is on the scene, tending to the poor couple.
The nurses always appear in teams - four at a time carrying a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
It works like most visitors to Wiesn: empty arrival, packed departure.
You can't tell who's in the liquor box under the mat.
"These are the ones who are totally ready", one of the paramedics shouts at me when I ask, then in the turret.
Police have named the victim of the accident
Police have named a 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died at a hospital.
Carole Paulson, of Brentwood, Chelmsford Road, was involved in an accident on Shenfield Road, in the town, on Friday afternoon.
He was taken to a hospital called the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving following the accident.
He's been released on bail since.
Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey was even considering joining the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of a failed imperial endeavor.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the travel books say.
The building surrounds the ends of the platforms, with a tower at each front corner, and looks like some kind of German country townhouse.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is a little wobbly.
However, the interior of the vaulted ticket office shows what a large-scale enterprise this was, the westernmost gateway.
The station was opened by the German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation, in August 1908.
Germany, the "late future" of conquest, wanted to realize its ambitions to conquer the Middle East with this railway from Damascus through Baghdad to what is now Saudi Arabia.
German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railroad was attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab guerrillas.
The relative isolation from surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt, driving the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station was no better.
In 1917, an ammunition train exploded and destroyed the building's beautifully crafted roof.
Turkish sources say there was sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly falling into disrepair and has been largely forgotten by history.
At the same time, today, as a railway gateway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region, it serves as an expanding diplomatic horizon for Turkey, at least in a symbolic sense.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is a symbol of commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq, Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I took a night train to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish parliamentarian Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, after about 10 and a half hours of gloom, which at the time set the tone for the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, a new city intended to be a symbol of a new secular state that turned its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, which is known to have Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This has caused some suspicion in the West, particularly in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern building made of stone and steel, built specifically for this purpose - located in a developing suburb, between half-built shopping malls and coffee houses, where the suited middle managers - men and women alike - meet to do business early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have been a centre-right politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he had a Blackberry on him.
"The party's foreign policy goal is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has upset the order", he said.
Turkey is isolated from the hinterland.
Today, he had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
It had to be open in both directions.
"But is it possible that sooner or later he will be forced to choose?"
"Turkey never wanted to take a short cut".
He then made a point that almost everyone I spoke to here has repeated almost mechanically: Turkey's relations with not only the Middle East, but also the Caucasus and the Black Sea region are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
It's as if they want to send a message that, figuratively speaking, with Turkey, all of Europe can get to Asia and the Middle East on those eastern railways.
When I was back at Hydarpasha Station, after another mostly awake night, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conur, the two German gentlemen who watched this ornate structure being built 100 years ago.
How surprised you would be to learn that Europe's Middle East ambitions are now largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I was waiting in the harbor for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was called the "sick man of Europe" at the time.
At least back then, there was no question of which continent would claim this exciting country.
Memorable Life Stories by Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: "As music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, Sept. 11) has conducted the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus.
Based on his musical plans for the neighborhood, he formed his wonderful youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
Originally, only those under 21 were allowed to join the choir, but when the Proteus performed its final in 1979 - many of us were in our late 20's - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape-shifter) was in keeping with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any quartet that was put before it - whether a madrigal or a Messiaen piece; unaccompanied or with a grand orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young choir was often awe-inspiring and always exciting, thanks to the man who inspired us to maintain our enthusiasm for music over the years.
How many times did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He always said, "A composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the score.
So sing it!"
His carmelite technique was always perfectly understandable and precise, but never dictatorial or excessive.
No matter what the musical standard, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote of him:
If there was ever a warden who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I got to know him well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I've written reviews of over 100 of his concerts in the last forty years or so, but never one that disappointed me, and often one that excited me.
Tod Handley had greatness and humility, which is very rare.
He hated the leaders who, in his words, simply "got around the world with a couple of well-known warriors".
We're all gonna miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your obituary, William Woodruff (September 25), "in 1946 he resumed his study of economic history at Oxford, and in 1950 he became a fellow of the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while continuing to prepare for his bachelor's degree, master's degree and PhD".
This is from the author's notes in Woodruff's work "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
He taught economic history at the University of Nottingham between 1946 and 1953, and completed his PhD thesis on the British rubber industry under Professor J. D. Chambers, which he published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In 1950-51 he did indeed stay in the USA on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for good and moved to Illinois.
There's no telling why Woodruff was embellishing this period of his career.
J. Vicente Resino in the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend J. Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and the Lifeboat" because his black and white, documentary-style photographs are impressive.
I was struck by their simplicity and strength, as well as by the respect I felt for the people in the photographs.
This exhibition is filled with emotion.
Resino is a master at capturing magical moments".
For the second time in a row, Honda has set a new sales record.
In November, Honda will begin selling the second generation Jazz.
Although the new model had a fairly large passenger compartment, the interior design was even more spacious.
All this is coupled with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and fuel-efficient.
It's evolution against revolution.
This is what the second-generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the new Jazz looks very similar to its predecessor, many internal changes have been made.
These include innovative design, new bodywork, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we get to the details of the new model, we should tell you that the new Jazz was released six years after the first generation was launched.
So first of all, we can say that Honda has managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although less well known in Europe, Jazz is breaking sales records in other markets.
One such market is Japan, where Jazz was the most popular car brand in 2002 and again this year in 2008.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million Jazz have been sold since its release.
The second market was the Old Continent, with almost half a million copies sold in six years.
However, Honda wants to increase traffic in the area with the new Jazz.
So while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz, by 2009 it is estimated to have sold 100,000 cars, which would result in a 17% growth in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8000 Jazz on the Spanish market, representing 6,7% of Honda's total Spanish sales.
For the new generation, the Spanish subsidiary's management expects to sell 2000 units in one year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly alleviate Honda's decline in sales in Spain.
The company forecasts 22,000 units sold by the end of this year, 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a 16% decline.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain from 1,6% last year to 1,8%.
I also want to increase that to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five-door compact hybrid - 4,370 mm long - of which the Japanese company would produce 200,000 worldwide a year.
The Japanese manufacturer claims that the US would account for 50% of Insight's market share, with the remainder being split between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, following the official launch in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more expansive in every way.
It is 3900 mm long (five centimetres longer), 1690 mm wide (two centimetres wider) and has a wheelbase of 5 centimetres, i.e. 2500 mm.
The height, however, remains unchanged at 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment has become more spacious.
The new bodywork and the fuel tank in the middle guarantee the greater interior space - a solution already known from the previous Jazz.
The total capacity of the so-called double-decker trunk has also increased to 399 litres, or 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
However, it is relevant that the dimensions mentioned refer to the type with the 1,4 engine, since the trunk of the 1,2 Honda Jazz is 379 litres.
Some external modifications can also be detected, such as rear tail lamps or optional panoramic glass roof and easier access to the rear seats.
In addition, the rear seat doors were raised to 80 degrees from the original Jazz's 67 degrees.
The second generation Jazz engines are new.
At the start of its production, this small model is available with two, 1.2 and 1.4 litre engines.
The i-VTEC technology offers both better power consumption than the previous model, lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical compatibility, while the engine delivers outstanding performance in all respects.
The 1.2-litre engine produces 90 horsepower at 6000 rpm and a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
This engine, which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 liters and produces 125 grams of CO2.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
A 100 horsepower 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters and emits 128 grams of CO2.
The collision avoidance "bee car"
To develop accident-prevention technologies, Nissan has taken inspiration from nature, specifically the world of bees, for its new invention.
A Japanese company has designed a robot that mimics the flying of bees to avoid accidents.
It may be that the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C will be the first step in the development of collision avoidance technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technology Center, in collaboration with the renowned Tokyo University's Advanced Science and Technology Research Center, have built this little robot in Japan.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and Research and Development, said that the BR23C is a further extension of Nissan's four-level safety cover.
The robot will enhance the collision avoidance capabilities of the company's products.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to a Nissan safety cover.
But even more important is the bee's complex eye, which sees in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing it to fly freely in its own private space.
To mimic the function of the complex eye, engineers have designed a device called a Laser Range Finder.
The instrument identifies obstacles within a 180-degree field of view of BR23C up to 2 metres, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts to collision avoidance.
"Once an obstacle is detected, the little robot immediately changes direction by mimicking the movements of the bee, moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid a collision.
The main difference between the system and the instruments currently available is that in this case the avoidance manoeuvre is performed completely automatically.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the avoidance maneuver cannot be up or down, nor transversely, but only in two dimensions and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels, that is, not in an infinite direction and manner as in the case of bees.
So Nissan used a rotation function in the robot to avoid collisions, in addition to acceleration and deceleration.
"This machine has to process and react to data every few seconds.
It doesn't require data storage or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can run without interruption with just a few dozen KB of memory.
Now, this may sound surprising, but it's not really gigabytes, but we're not even talking megabyte-sized memory.
This is the first step towards developing the technology for instantaneous collision avoidance, which Nissan estimates could be incorporated into series production cars within ten years.
The robot is powered by lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, the unit could be integrated with the GPS satellite navigation system to help the driver reach his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of the Mortgage
We must admit that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of cash to invest, is not lacking in common sense.
With the recession under their belts and to keep Americans from getting caught up in the delusions of questionable mortgage banks, they created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
This is the "Hotel Bad Credit" ... which means the jailers.
The picture of the accommodation and especially the reception desk suggests that we should think again, twice, or even three times, whether it is really time to borrow.
And especially where to get a loan, because that's probably the point of this thing.
The information on the website is indeed useful, but it is not very detailed.
It's more for teenagers than the general public.
But what if we supplemented the game?
For example, the hotel would have our dream room.
Actually, it's something, because we're not even thinking about buying a house.
Morgan Stanley is opening up its capital to MUFG.
Morgan Stanley announced it is investing in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, paying $9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after Morgan Stanley stock prices plummeted on the stock market.
A week after the preliminary agreement was announced, the two banks said MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock at $25.25 per share, for a total of $3 billion.
The price accepted is more than 19% below the book value of the securities on 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which will provide a 10% return at an exchange rate of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction is being executed at an average price of $29, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock price fell 6.79% at around 5pm Greenwich Mean Time, closing at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to accelerate its transformation into a bank holding company", explains John Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley approved a new status last week that allows it to diversify its operations while coming under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from Wall Street corporate giants.
The terms announced on Monday show that the deal has been modified in recent days: Last Monday, Morgan announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago we thought the stake would be entirely made up of common shares", explained Toshihide Mizuno, managing director of MUFG in Tokyo.
'However, given the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and protect against potential risks.'
On a weighted average basis, MUFG pays 7% more for Morgan Stanley shares than the book value.
The transaction will result in a reduction of the return on equity by approximately 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG may convert half of its preference shares into common shares after one year if the trading price of the latter is more than 50% above the conversion rate, i.e. approximately USD 47, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley will thereby ensure that the funds from MUFG will enable it to exploit its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, the group's spokesman declined to provide specific information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the merger of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier 1 solvency ratio by around 15%, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan said its balance sheet had "definitely" improved since late August.
The past few weeks have been a big ordeal for the group, with its stock price plunging by half and the cost of its insurance against default skyrocketing.
This cost decreased on Monday but remained high at around 12%.
One of the big investment banks that has survived the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch is Goldman Sachs, which last week announced it had raised $15 billion, some of it from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group of companies.
Rafael Correa's statement on Monday, from Quito
The reconstruction of the republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is a joint project of Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Following the example of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa on Sunday outlined his ideas for a new constitution.
It has successfully fulfilled its mission, with 64% of voters voting in favour in the referendum, according to official results, which covered 80% of the votes cast.
According to the report, 28% of the population voted with gender, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were cast incomplete by the voters.
The constitution needed 50% + 1 vote to pass.
Two polls at polling stations on Sunday and a count by a non-governmental organization both showed a huge majority of "yes" votes, with 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa, by the way, was already talking about winning his constitution on the night from Sunday to Monday.
"The constitution has won a resounding victory", he declared, thanking Ecuadorians at his governor's residence in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers (180 miles) southwest of Quito.
As you know, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chavez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
The vote was conducted in a calm atmosphere, the OAS observer mission reported, with the main issue being a 444-point text summarizing the principles of the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The proposed constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, while retaining the state's right to "design development" for a country that basically lives off oil production by foreign companies and foreign exchange sent by emigrants.
The draft constitution of Correa, elected in 2006, also strengthens the powers of the head of state, who can only serve two consecutive terms and has the right to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he intends to take advantage of this opportunity and will run again for the presidency in February 2009.
The Constitution also includes free health care and education, and the president has already begun to implement these in a country of 13.9 million people, half of whom live below the poverty line.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use the Ecuadorian facility as a base for US anti-drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
Egyptian commandos have struck at the kidnappers who took hostage 11 tourists and eight of their companions ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held for ten days in the desert before being flown safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were freed in the early hours of the morning in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good condition, they arrived by plane at Al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to Cairo International Airport, at about 4:30 this afternoon.
The hostages were forbidden to speak to the press and were immediately taken to a hospital in Maadi, a residential area outside Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "in good health" and the kidnappers "have not been paid a ransom", said Egypt's tourism minister, Zoheir Garanna, at the airport.
The hostages were taken on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they were on a road trip, and then dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown hostage takers.
The group included 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the safari company Aegyptous.
An Egyptian security official said a special task force of 30 people arrived in two helicopters at the scene just before dawn to raid the hostage cells.
"Half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled", said the official, who asked not to be named.
He also said that a total of 150 special forces from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade were sent to Sudan, where they were supplemented by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian diplomatic chief, Franco Frattini, who is in Belgrade, stressed the role of Italian secret agents and special operations groups.
"We must admit that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our intelligence personnel and task forces", he said, without providing further details.
He also denied that ransom was paid for the hostages.
The day before, the Sudanese army announced that it had stopped a SUV carrying the kidnappers during a patrol, killing six of them (including the Chadian leader) and arresting two.
The army claimed that the hostages were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which immediately denied this.
Lettres - The "silent majority" of culture
The focus of the news and the current election campaign is the debate on the financing of culture.
We can only be thankful.
But a piece of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will raise their voice to shed light on the ridiculous amounts of money spent on starving little museums, archives, archaeological digs and national historic sites?
What politician dares to remind the federal government that it doesn't care about its monuments and heritage buildings?
Or that neither in Quebec nor in Canada are there laws that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government has spent three and a half million euros just to restore the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
And the Constitution of our American neighbors states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that heritage must be protected in concert by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government agencies.
The Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec) is a society of 211 historical, cultural, archival and genealogical societies, with more than 40 000 volunteers who work to research history and preserve a large number of private archives and archaeological finds with a minimal budget.
Often these organizations defend our heritage with their teeth and nails, and protest with the last of their strength as developers and policymakers direct their bulldozers at our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will someone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Part of Fortis bank nationalised by Benelux governments
The Benelux countries are helping Fortison, a Belgian-Dutch bank that was hit by the spillover effects of the US credit crisis, by partial nationalisation. The three countries are providing a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the financial and insurance institution, which also has interests in Hungary.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments held a high-level meeting on the matter at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
Fortis Bank is the first major crisis in the euro area in the international financial crisis, which has been raging for more than a year, and the decisions taken in its case are therefore in some respects a precedent.
The decision taken on Sunday night will see nearly half (49%) of the bank's holdings in all three countries bought up.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including in particular the activities, mainly insurance, it acquired from the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis' stock has started to plummet in the last week, and in the second half of the week, the institution has already been experiencing serious crisis events.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to be allowed to go bankrupt.
The company's stock just fell about 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the stock has fallen by more than two-thirds.
At current share prices, the total market capitalisation of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but this is not realistic according to the company directors.
The management also blamed overseas market uncertainty over the adoption of the $700 billion US package for the Fortis stock drop.
By Monday, the stock was up a little.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has been looking for private buyers, but no one has come forward with a decent offer.
The Belgian Government has previously indicated that investors do not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
The bank's customers have not been panicked or their accounts raided.
In Hungary, Fortis has an independent branch and has also acquired leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to contract with applicants based on their drug purchase history.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that requires the use of prescription data to be subject to the consent of the person concerned.
It has to be in independent hands or we'll leave the chicken to the fox". - Richard Dicket, developer of a prescription tracking program, quoted in The Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the premium and the amount of the claims subject to the health condition of the applicant and, if they consider the risk too great, do not insure the applicant.
In the past, a person was sent for a medical examination and the contract was only made with the result of the examination.
A decade ago, Dick devised a much cheaper method: From pharmacies, he could easily obtain a patient's medication purchase in the last year and a half by means of a patient ID number, and from that program, he could infer what illness he had and what his health condition was.
For example, if you regularly take high doses of cholesterol lowering drugs, it indicates that you have practically unmanageable high blood lipids, which immediately puts you in a higher risk category.
The scheme is available in several versions, some of which also set a risk multiplier, leaving the insurer with little to do but paperwork, although with some minor difficulties.
The disadvantages include that some medicines can be used for multiple purposes, such as for migraines or hot flashes, but are also effective against depression.
The latter is considered a significant risk-increasing factor for commercial insurers, while the former is not.
Companies have been set up to collect and process data, and they ask for the patient's consent before they can obtain the information from pharmacies.
Now the authorities are obliging them to do so, although they have not been punished for their omission.
Some companies have recently been processing lab results and linking them to drug usage data to provide even more accurate information about patients' health.
More and more companies are gaining access to data, and controlling its use is becoming increasingly difficult.
There is a separate health data protection law, but it only applies to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
Congress is considering a bill that would give the government control over companies that specialize in reporting.
Dick Richard realises that this is not enough and has therefore developed a further programme to make the transmission of data subject's explicit consent mandatory.
It is another matter that the person concerned cannot refuse consent, otherwise the insurers will not contract him.
So the chickens are somewhat dependent on the fox's goodwill.
The global menu of Marseille
Trade between the European Union and India will double
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this topic dominated the agenda of the ninth summit, alongside other issues, mostly global.
Today, there will be a Franco-Indian summit, where the main topic will be nuclear cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is a rising democratic power which should have a greater say in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to agree on whether to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not raised at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as EU President and Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and agreed to double trade to more than 100 billion euros in five years.
Given that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
The Commission has also taken into account the fact that the Union has a number of airports in the region.
India aims to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU is India's number one trading partner, Delhi is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism in all its forms, were condemned by both sides and the call for a UN conference was urgently called.
They also called for the Doha trade round to be completed, although both have been largely a failure.
The EU has confirmed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, which aims to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed to this, as did the global agreement at next year's climate conference to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
They also want to prevent food prices from rising and they supported convening an international conference to review the financial crisis.
The Indian prime minister is heading to the French capital today for a bilateral meeting to discuss the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
Paris is hoping to get French companies a contract worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors in India.
According to news reports, the deal is for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers are represented at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the 60th Buchmesse, the most important international copyright fair.
This year's Frankfurt International Book Fair, which will feature more than 403,000 books and 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, will be held on a 171,790-square-foot site in Turkey.
The Italian Government will be represented at the opening ceremony by Francesco Maria Giro, Under-Secretary of State for Cultural Heritage and Activities, who will occupy 264 square metres of exhibition space through the creation of a single Italia Pont.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the 'Room Structure' of Buchmesse 5.0 where data, trends and prospects for the Italian book publishing sector will be presented.
According to the data, the proportion of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is continuously decreasing, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
The plane of Steve Fossett, a billionaire who disappeared a year ago, has been found.
The wreckage of billionaire Steve Fossett's plane has been found. It disappeared over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007.
The wreckage was found at an elevation of 10,000 feet [3,000 m] near Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, on the border of California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dispelled any remaining doubts: "A team has been dispatched after the plane's location was determined and we can now be certain that it is the same plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared", he said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said that a few hours after the wreckage was discovered, a committee of inquiry was called to identify the aircraft and determine that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett left for a three-hour flight from Yerington, Nevada.
Also yesterday in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal effects near his Mammoth Lakes home.
Two I.D.s in Fosset's name, issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was abandoned a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has set several peaks that have made him a legend.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he successfully completed the first circumnavigation of the globe in a balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world without landing.
Among his many records is a flight over the Andes at 15,445 meters (15,050 feet) with a co-pilot.
GLK, shocking commercial
An unusual but original and determined form of hobbyist off-road vehicle with large surfaces and cleaned corners.
In a nutshell, this is the latest "compact SUV" from Mercedes-Benz, with which the German automaker has tried to bring a fresh impetus to the market.
It is precisely because of this unconventional content that the introductory campaign of the SUV GLK, which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17, will be surprising and unusual.
The advertising campaign accompanying the presentation of the new vehicle uses a previously unknown means of media communication, including utopian 3D posters, which have not been used by a car brand in Italy.
The giant poster campaign, which consists of three stages, will dominate Milan's central shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first stage of this new type of media communication will begin with a presentation of the car in a full-scale format, where the new SUV will be shown in near-real-life and three-dimensional form with the help of special glasses distributed around Corso Como.
The viewer will feel as if the car is sticking out of the poster.
Then, with the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK is shown one by one, to then be assembled into a single image.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical advertising world of the automotive industry with this promotion.
Will this attract the interest of potential customers?
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
They're young people from Triveneto, they're probably going to be banned from the ring.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is ashamed of now, members of a group called "Ultras Italia" that has been following the team for years and that, to be honest, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They never fought with the opposing fans.
The core of the group is on the right.
The main organizers are coming from Trivento.
And also from Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
They were joined in Sofia by smaller, scattered groups (in fact, only a few units) from Campania and Apulia.
Italian flags with the city of origin of the supporters were waved, but were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
They're following the example of the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they were facing a real Nazi cheerleading squad, the Levski Druckers.
The Italian Football Association issued 144 tickets to Italian fans, which were name-tickets to help control the team.
The Ministry of Interior checked everyone: there was no one in Sofia who was being prosecuted, no one who was banned from the stadium.
Four Italian fans with football-related priors have been denied tickets and travel.
The Ministry of Interior is currently waiting for the minutes from the Sofia police, and then it will take the necessary measures: those fans who are arrested or identified during the riots can be banned for up to five years.
It is an international ban, which applies not only to Italian, but to all European stadiums.
So our football hooligans can't set foot on any football field.
I'm glad you did.
But we must also fear that the hooligans will find followers, that is, that to this 150 head, others will join.
"This fire must be put out immediately, and there is no excuse for this behavior", the Interior Ministry said.
So we better keep our eyes open, especially as the Wednesday national team game in Lecce approaches.
There's a small cell in Puglia that supports the Italian Ultras.
The Monitoring Service is meeting tomorrow, and on Tuesday, the Sports Security Analysis Committee, which could be a division of Homeland Security, will meet with the intelligence services that deal with fan behavior.
"Screaming Duce-Duce and waving arms under the Italian anthem?
This idea was developed, rather unfortunately, by Domenico Mazzilli, who a few weeks ago was appointed head of the Ministry of the Interior's surveillance service (a post previously held by Francesco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the Chief of Police of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italia group has operated since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true, in Bulgaria it's not illegal to keep the Duke alive, but that still made the behavior of those 150-200 fans shameful.
I'm no sociologist, the first man on the watch list added, but crimes must be prosecuted in the country where they were committed.
So far, this group has not caused any problems, so we need to investigate exactly what happened and consider what to do next.
But let's talk a little bit about the singing of the Italian national anthem: it's not a crime, but, if I may say so, it's not polite... "
