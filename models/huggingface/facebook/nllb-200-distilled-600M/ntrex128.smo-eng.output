Welsh AMs are concerned about "looking like muppets"
Some AMs are angry at the suggestion to change their name to MWPs (Welsh Parliamentary Representatives).
It emerged as a result of plans to rename the session of the Welsh Parliament.
AMs from all political parties are worried they will be scorned.
One Labor AM said that his team was concerned "like Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means daft and pwp means or.
Plaid AM says the whole group is "unlucky" and suggests alternatives.
A Welshman said his group was "open minded" about the name change, but noted it was a shortened version of MWP to Muppet.
The Welsh letter w is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English letter u in this case.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently making changes to the name, said: "The final decision to call the Assembly Members is, of course, made by the members themselves".
Welsh Council now has the power to change its name, thanks to the 2017 Government of Wales Act.
In the case of Mrs. Thun, Tomite was accused of being a witch in front of the jury for allegedly having been a witch in the witch hunt for Welsh nationals.
In the AMs, Tomite plays the melody of the Welsh language Aborah no aore while the WMPs, tera râ, play the MWP in the long-winded hoê aparauraa huiraatira.
AMs have reported other options, but failing to reach an agreement could be a headache for Elin Jones, the mayor, who is expected to provide a model of the rules to change in weeks.
Other changes to the way the council works will be included in the reform legislation, such as laws on cancelling AMs and the committee's design.
When they debate the law, AMs will have the final say on where to say it.
Macedonia votes in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters decide whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was held in an attempt to end a long-running dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens has maintained that the name of its northern neighbor is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO proposals.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is a consequence of EU and NATO membership.
As Harlem's cathedrals close, St. Martin's Day is silent
The story, is that of Mr. Adams,the old men I spoke to said there was a wall and a church on each corner.
"Today, there is nothing".
He explained that the disappearance of the walls was light.
"People are interacting in a different way now", he says.
"Bars are no longer a place for people to gather".
In the case of churches, he was concerned that the profits from the sale of assets would not last as long as the leaders expected, and that they would soon return to their original origins.
Churches, he added, could be replaced with apartments and condominiums occupied by people who do not support the rest of the neighborhood.
"Many who buy houses in these houses will be destroyed", he prophesied, "and the day will come when these churches will be shut down quickly because there is no doubt that many of these people will become members of these churches".
The Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin ten years later were both built by white congregations before Harlem became a black city.
In the 1930's, the first Methodist congregation left.
A black parish church nearby took over the house.
St. Martin's was taken over by the black parish led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the Harlem shopping center chain on 125th Street that refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 destroyed the building, but when Father Johnson's parish planned to rebuild it, they ordered the governor.
Father Johnson's son and St. Martin's replacement, Rev. David Johnson, proudly called the carillon "the voice of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July had a different view: "It is a cultural treasure" and "an unchangeable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also said that the expert was the world's first black musician to play the cello, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the big carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, it is not a replacement for St. Martin's.
The incident at St. Martin's a few months ago was a complex story of artists and contractors, some hired by church clergy while others by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry, the parish's administrative body comprising the clergy, wrote to the diocese in July, concerned that the diocese "will try to put a price on the building", despite the fact that the vestry was not affected by the hiring of artists and contracts sent by the diocese.
Some churches complained about the lack of understanding of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy is attacked by a comedian while diving in California
Officials say a 13-year-old boy was attacked by a comedian on Saturday while diving for a swimming pool in California on the first day of the swimming season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Encinitas Beach's Beacon Beach.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that about 30 minutes after he and his friends went down, he heard the boy's cry for help and then tried to help pull him out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought that the only joy was to catch a spark, but he "knew he was screaming, 'I got it!'
'It hit me!'
"She's completely paralyzed", Hammel noticed as he reached the boy.
"I told everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a fun in the water!' " Hammel said.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in a critical condition in San Diego.
The kind of humor that caused the attack is unknown.
In a press interview, rescue officer Captain Larry Giles said that a joke had been seen at the scene a few weeks earlier, but it was certain that it was not a joke.
Giles also said that the woman was suffering from severe injuries to her upper body.
The beach was closed for 48 hours from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's to Ecinitas for research and safety reasons.
Giles said the site is home to more than 135 different types of comedy, many of which are not dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to enter the beautiful British market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams by introducing departmental-grade models where professional services work.
The beauty tracks will be rolled out to 11 stores across the country as part of a major push into the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow as shopping and furniture prices decline, and will be expanded to more stores next year if successful.
The recruitment of beauty comes as supermarkets search for ways to reuse the empty shelves that were previously used for TVs, microwaves, and furniture.
Sainsbury has announced plans to expand its luxury offering to include up to 3,000 products from brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. For the first time, PawPaw.
L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees lines will also offer more space, with branded units similar to those found in Boots.
The supermarket is revamping its Boutique makeup line so that more products are vegan-friendly, something that is increasingly in demand by small shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will be hosting a trial run at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
With online shopping and the shift to buying a few meals a day in local stores, supermarkets have to do more to attract customers to visit.
Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe suggests that stores will look more like stores as the supermarket tries to compete with Aldi and Lidl, by offering more services and non-food items.
Since buying the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury's Argos store has put hundreds of stores and exhibited a variety of Habitats, which he says has increased retail sales and increased revenue.
The supermarket's first attempt to restore its beauty and pharmacy was unsuccessful.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a business partnership with Boots, but the partnership was terminated after a dispute over how to divide revenues from the chemical stores into its supermarkets.
The new scheme comes three years after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
It said Lloyds would help with the plan by adding expansion of luxury brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Says Sainsbury's business director Paul Mills-Hicks: "We have changed our appearance, but we have felt our ways of entertaining and performing for our convert.
We also have authorized professional partners who will be able to provide guidance.
Our brand is designed to meet all needs, and the entertainment environment and convenience facilities make us a beautiful place to challenge traditional shopping".
Peter Jones is furious when Holly Willoughby slips out of the £11 million prize
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has 'seen' when TV show host Holly Willoughby walks away from £11 million sale with her lifetime award business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their Truly homewear and accessories brand.
The pair's company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has imitated Dragons 'Den star Peter Jones by suddenly leaving their live-action label business to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to reports, Jones was "confused" when the TV star during a violent rally on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new deal - up to £1.5 million - meant she didn't have enough time to give away their Truly clothing and accessories.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to more than double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
Willoughby, 37, announced his departure on Instagram Jones actually left the country in one of his vacation homes.
According to one source: "This was Holly's top priority.
It is his long-term future that he will see in the next few years.
Everyone involved was surprised by her decision to leave.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday, especially as the announcement was approaching.
At Marlow's headquarters, there is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell products".
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning host, one of Britain's biggest bank stars, could cost the company millions of dollars due to massive investments in products ranging from roofing and candles to clothing and homewares, as well as the potential delay in its launch.
It can also mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and his wife, Dan Baldwin, had known Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp founded Truly in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together, with Jones owning 40% of Baldwin's TV company.
Willoughby will serve as M&S brand ambassador and will host ITV's I'm A Celebrity to replace Ant McPartlin.
Last night, a close friend of Jones' said, "We don't have a say in his business affairs".
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love",
He was overlooking the criticism he would face from the media for what some might consider an "unreasonable" comment and for his overwhelming praise of the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump making such big concessions?
In its pretence of "new news", Trump said.
"I have made no sacrifice".
He said Kim is open to a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a significant step toward moving the pandemic to North Korea.
But the talks on denuclearization have come to a halt.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's top leader, spoke to world leaders at the UN more than three months after the Singapore summit in June, saying the General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "similar response" from the United States to North Korea's initial efforts.
Instead, he revealed, the United States continues its violent sanctions.
In his speech to the assembly, Trump expressed a more optimistic view.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he admitted.
"We were ready to join the North Korean war.
Millions of people would have died.
So we have this wonderful relationship.
He said his efforts to improve their relationship with Kim had been successful, including halting rocket tests, helping to free detainees, and returning American troop remains.
He also confirmed his new plan to discuss his relationship with Kim.
Trump wrote to the audience in front of him and said, "It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people are standing there".
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, killing hundreds
Foreign non-profit organizations, for example, informed those who were not needed after the Lombok earthquake.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombok's population has been wiped out, no humanitarian crisis, which is needed to spur international aid, has been declared.
Unfortunately, they are so obvious that they often do not ask for international support, so it can be difficult, according to Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children has assembled a team to travel to Belfast, it is uncertain whether foreign workers will be allowed to work on the ground.
A spokesman for the country's emergency services, Mr. Sutopo, said that Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to determine whether international organizations would be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
With the ongoing earthquake that is affecting Indonesia, the government is too unprepared for the wrath of nature.
While the tsunami walls are being built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other beaches.
Although there was a warning, the tsunami wave in Palu was apparently not visible and likely caused deaths.
Even under the best of conditions, traveling around many Indonesian islands is difficult.
Natural disasters make shopping even more challenging.
It took at least three days for an ambulance to reach Palu from Lombok, where it was set to provide medical care for earthquake victims.
Indonesia's poor infrastructure was the main focus of President Joko Widodo's election, and he was spending money on roads and railways.
Although Mr. Joko will be re-elected next year, budgetary problems have affected his administration.
In Indonesia, where many Muslims use a more conservative definition of faith, persistent religious tensions are another source of motivation for Mr. Joko.
While Christian and Muslim guerrillas engaged in warfare using sails, arrows, and arrows, and other ancient weapons, more than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes.
Witness: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored the same against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge's 89-minute goal prevented Liverpool from beating Chelsea in the Premier League.
With his team down 1-0, Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal.
Before he could shoot a shot at the far pole, he touched the ball with his left hand.
The gun was aimed at the top right corner of the net, but it flew high above the box.
Then the ball was thrown from the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the goal.
Players like Shaq always enjoy playing the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to buy myself as much as I could", says Sturridge LiverpoolFC.com the ball.
"I touched one after I saw Kante move and shoot unconsciously.
The 25-minute goal by Belgian superstar Eden Hazard gave Chelsea a 1-0 lead at half-time.
In that special performance, the Blues again kicked a bus back Mateo Kovacic before leaving the centre and running into Liverpool's half-time.
In the middle, Kovacic buses were quickly switched.
Then, he pointed out a dangerous way Hazard was put in the penalty area.
Hazard ran away from the defense and defeated Liverpool's Alisson Becker in a left-footed attempt at the long net.
At the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, Liverpool and Napoli will meet in a Champions League group match at 3 p.m. on Wednesday.
At 3 p.m. on Thursday in London, Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
According to the national emergency services, 832 people have died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia.
According to a spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency, many people reportedly were trapped in the collapse of buildings damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet.
More than 380,000 people live in Palu, which was covered in ruined houses.
After a woman was shot dead, police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder
When a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning, a murder investigation was opened.
A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after a 44-year-old man was found walking from injuries in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7.55 a.m.
Police urged anyone present to report anything he saw or heard.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I would encourage anyone who was in the John Street area of Birkenhead and heard or saw something strange to contact us.
I also recommend that anyone who may have found anything on the dashcam, especially taxi drivers, contact us as they may have some information that is very important to our investigation.
The woman's body was found in a house, and a police officer confirmed that she was a Birkenhead native.
Friends think they know the woman who arrived this afternoon to ask where she was this morning.
Police indicate that the next victim's kin is being notified during the investigation.
A Grayson Mews resident who works as a cab driver has just tried to enter his apartment, but police have warned him that entry and exit are not allowed.
When he realized what had happened, he was speechless.

The debate over 'rewriting history' in the statue of Oliver Cromwell is now widespread
Its expulsion would serve as poetic retribution for the zealous Puritan adherents who carried out the Taliban-like destruction of several religious and cultural artefacts in England.
However, the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "crazy" and an "effort to change history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It seemed inevitable that the current controversy over the removal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell from the outside of the Palace of Westminster would be the focus.
Cromwell did not direct or participate in the British War Expedition.
The wrong Cromwell may be killed in retaliation for what his grandfather Thomas did a century ago.
The iconic Cromwell painting by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th-century imagination and a piece of history of a man considered by many to be worthy of commemoration.
The Sunday Telegraph noted Mr Goldsmith: "Cromwell is seen by many - perhaps more so in the late 19th century than now - as a parliamentary protection against the pressures of, in his case, the monarchy.
Or is that a perfect picture that is the subject of current historical debate?
Cromwell was a distinguished scholar who represented one side of that divide, and it was clear that the conflicts of the mid-17th century affected the future of our empire.
It is also important to honor and remember his accomplishments as Lord Protector".
A homicidal pig kills a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
The man, known only as "Yuan", was found dead with a gunshot wound near a vaccine market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he went to the market on Wednesday with his cousin to sell 15 pigs from the nearby province of Yunnan.
The door to the nearby pigsty opened when his cousin found the dead the next morning.
He said it was a large pig with a mouth in the stove.
According to the report, a special investigation confirmed that the farmer was killed by a 550-pound pig.
The cousin, who goes by the nickname "Wu", was quoted in the Guiyang Evening News as saying, "My cousin's feet were bleeding and vomiting".
Yuan was shown in a video featuring him feeding his pigs at the market at 4.40am on Thursday.
About an hour later, her body was found.
Yuan's animal or his cousin was not the animal that killed the man.
The pig was detained to prevent an attack, the market manager told the Evening News, while the police were gathering witnesses.
It is reported that the market authorities and Yuan's family are in discussions to decide on his death.
Although rare, pigs were first identified as an invasive species.
At their farm in Massachusetts, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig in 2016, a attack that left a man seriously injured.
A Welsh farmer was tied to his jaw ten years ago by a 650-pound pig until his wife chased the animal.
Pigs are usually non-stimulating, but blood tasting can act as a "stimulant", according to a Manitoba farmer who spoke to CBC News after an Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012.
It's just a game.
They're nippers, so curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
"You should show them a lot of respect", she says.
The southwestern U.S. is likely to experience heavy rainfall from the remnants of Hurricane Rosa
As expected, Hurricane Rosa has lost its strength as it crosses the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the coming days, Rosa will bring heavy rains to parts of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
By 5 a.m., Rosa was a Category 1 storm with winds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles (385 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, as Eastern time on Sunday.
On Sunday, Rosa is expected to head north.
Meanwhile, a road has begun to build across the Pacific Ocean and eastward to the U.S. westward. Rosa will begin to take the deep tropical moisture north to southwest of the United States as it moves into the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm.
On Monday, Rosa brings up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
And, over the next few days, heavy rains will hit the Southwest as tropical moisture interfaces with the road ahead.
In the local area, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will cause severe flooding, debris flooding and could sweep through the desert.
Rainfall rates may reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in some areas due to the extreme humidity, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Parts of the Southwest, especially much of Arizona, can receive up to 4 inches of rain.
Because of the widespread nature of the tropical rain, rapidly rising precipitation can lead to flooding.
With the possibility of hot rains, it is foolish to walk out into the desert.
Thunderstorms will bring winds and dust to nearby areas, and heavy rains can turn valleys into large rivers.
Parts of the coast of Southern California will experience heavy local rainfall as the storm approaches.
There is a chance of more than a half inch of rainfall, which can lead to some debris and slippery roads.
The first rainy season of the area will occur that day.
In late Sunday and early Monday, a few tropical monsoon showers will begin to reach Arizona before rainfall spreads late Monday and Tuesday.
From Tuesday to Wednesday, heavy rainfall will be expected in the Four Corners.
As the Arctic cools and the tropics keep warm in October, there may be significant changes in the US' temperature.
This can sometimes lead to sudden changes in temperature when you are far away.
On Sunday, the central United States saw a dramatic change in temperature.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees.
The longest summer heat will try to grow and expand once in the coming days.
October is expected to start warming in much of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures peaking in the 80s from the Southeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures in New York City could reach as high as 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees warmer than usual.
The highest temperature forecast for the eastern United States is expected to be reached in the first half of October, according to our long-term weather forecast.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was watched by over 20 million people
On six television networks, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who convicted him of sexual assault in the 1980s, give a strong testimony on Thursday.
The media disrupted their regular scheduled program to air Friday's last-minute roundup - an order Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake had placed for the FBI to look into the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Health Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had begged him for alcohol and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party.
In his pleasant speech, Kavanaugh said that his complete confidence had not been fulfilled.
More than 20.4 million Nielsen viewers recorded it on Friday were sure to watch it.
On CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC, the company is monitoring the regularity of the show.
Other broadcast networks, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, did not receive any early signals.
Furthermore, Nielsen can find it difficult to compare the number of individual viewers on the newsroom.
To put it in perspective, compare the audience size to the Academy Awards or a football game.
With an average of 5.69 million viewers a day during the trial, Nielsen said Fox News Channel, his hosting views strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, which led all networks.
With 3.26 million viewers, ABC came in second.
According to Nielsen, CBS has 3.1 million viewers, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million, and CNN has 2.52 million.
Even after the trial, the joy was still strong.
The theme of Friday's play is Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras captured him on Friday morning shouting protesters as he attempted to ride an elevator to a Justice Committee hearing after a Republican official issued a statement saying he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh.
He endured the speech in front of her for a few minutes while broadcasting on CNN.
One woman said, "I am here before you".
"Do you think he is telling the nation the truth?
"You have power but many women have no power", someone told her
Before the elevator doors were closed, Flake said, his Office had already issued a statement, and he would have many comments during the committee's review.
Hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to send Kavanaugh's decision to the entire Senate for a vote, cable and broadcast communications were all covered up.
However, Flake said that the only way to do so would be to satisfy the demand of the Democratic minority to have the FBI investigate the lawsuit against the candidate for next week.
Talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, helped convince Flake of a group.
Flake made his decision after discussing it with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's decision had an impact because it was clear that Republicans did not get the right votes to approve Kavanaugh before the poll.
An FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh has been launched by President Trump.
Brexit critics are "playing politics", according to British Prime Minister May
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who opposed her desire to leave the EU of "politically playing with the future of Britain and harming the public good".
Theresa May, the UK prime minister, arrived in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018, for the Conservative Party Conference.
In another interview that appeared alongside him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson was forced to criticize his Checkers plan for Brexit, calling the idea "extremely absurd".
Brother Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, a suspect in the death of an LSU player
Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, was shot dead, and police have detained one suspect in the case.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson is in prison and charged with second-degree murder.

Police said they obtained glasses from the scene and obtained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS station WAFB.
Police said that after Simpson was interviewed, he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The lawyer said that he had settled for $350,000.
A head wound to the neck caused the death, according to an initial report from the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released Friday.
The Louisiana State Police's fugitive team, the state's police crime bureau, Southern University police, and local residents are all being thanked by the department for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, athletic director at LSU, commended the "vigorous and tireless pursuit of justice" by local law.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward was born and raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was an LSU basketball player.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
Wayde's death leaves LSU basketball coach Will Wade "sad" and "shocked", he said Friday morning.
"You're always worried about that", says Wade.
Mexico City recovers ash from a volcano
The southern suburbs of Mexico City are now covered in dust from the Popocatepetl volcano.
After the two-day operation and 183 gas and ash eruptions recorded within 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Prevention issued a warning to Mexicans on Saturday to avoid the volcano.
The house was experiencing tremors and thunder.
Images shared on social media showed car goggles in Mexico City areas such as the Xochimilco covered in thin layers of dust.
Since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that shook central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have observed a rise in activity in the volcano which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
Don Goyo, a volcano, has been erupting continuously since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists fight before the anniversary of the independence election
In the first year of Catalonia's secession, six people were detained in Barcelona on Saturday as independence protesters clashed with riot police and others participated in competitive dances.
In streets often crowded with visitors, they were attacked by a gang of separatists while they were attacked with eggs and painted powder by violent police.
Later that day, riots broke out, and the guards used their logs to break the riot.
Over the course of a few hours, union protesters chanting "Long live Spain" clashed with pro-independence groups chanting "No forgetting, no forgiveness".
According to local newspapers, 14 people who suffered minor injuries during the protests were treated.
A year after the October 1 election, which Madrid deemed illegal but praised by Catalan separatists, the conflict in the area remains high.
Despite the low turnout and the high absence of independence activists, voters chose to be independent.
Authorities in Catalonia say nearly 1000 people were injured during riots between police and voters last year as they tried to hold elections at polling stations across the province.
To stop a protest against the national police, pro-independence groups camped out Friday night.
The vision continued, but it had to move in a different direction.
68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes admitted that he had no hope of independence for Catalonia He and his wife were both in the process of separation.
"We had one of our best moments last year.
So we're there, and I watched my parents cry with joy because they were able to vote, she said.
While many of their prominent leaders are in private exile or detention awaiting trial for their roles in the electoral process and the subsequent declaration of independence, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain power this year despite holding a major battle if little victory in regional elections last December.
The police support group was telephoned by 42-year-old engineer Joan Puig, who said the authorities had caused the situation on both sides.
The turmoil is slowly escalating, he says.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders held pending trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would contest the next European Parliament election.
The best way to resist the Spanish government, he argued, is to overthrow democratic principles and restrain the European elections.
Londonderry: A man was arrested after a car hit his home
After a car hit a house in Londonderry, three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested.
At about 7:30 P.M. on Thursday, the Ballynagard Crescent event took place.
The destruction of the doors and the structure itself as Det Insp Bob Blemings called it.
Perhaps an arrow was once fired at the car.
Livingston Rangers won 1-0 thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston sealed the win
Livingston surprised Rangers, giving Steven Gerrard second place in 18 games as Ibrox's manager.
Dolly Menga's goal was the difference when Gary Holt and Hibernian's side tied for second.
Gerrard's side have never won a Premiership game this season and face Hearts, who are in the top eight, next Sunday.
Rangers play in Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston have now extended their previous league record to six games, and Holt has never had a taste of playing since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses an opportunity to fight the government
With their straightforward approach causing many Rangers problems, Holt's team had to take the lead long before they scored.
When Alan Lithgow came close to hitting Craig Halkett's head on goal after Scott Robinson broke but only pulled his effort wide, the only thing he could do was spin his shot.
Realizing that this could make it difficult for the guests to set up, the hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them.
And that is how the decisive result came about.
After the Rangers' free kick, Livingston got a chance Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to arrange Menga, who hit and scored from the middle of the box.
The security of the building seemed unusable at the time, and officer Liam Kelly was largely uninvolved despite Rangers having a lot of stuff,
Although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue, this pattern persisted until the second half.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor turned Scott Pittman down, and stared at Lithgow from Livingston's next set of games.
Cross continued to enter Livingston's box but was eliminated on each occasion, with two penalty appealsone for the ball and one for a dui to Glenn Middleton, a replacement, which Halkett denied both.
Livingston's 'Famous' - research
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
It was a remarkable performance and achievement for Livingston.
They had more purpose in this way of moving, and to a man, it was great.
Since returning to the top division, their staff and playing style have remained unchanged, but Holt deserves special thanks for the way he has inspired the club since the manager.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was superb, commanding a good defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes the whole time.
But the Rangers had no incentive.
Even though they were inferior to Gerrard, they always failed in those plans.
They had no last ball - they only cut the side of the house - and as a wake-up call for Rangers, they are now in the middle of the table.
In Cologne, Erdogan receives a mixed reception
The leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday, September 29.
The debate over President Erdogan's visit to Germany, which aims to repair the barrier between NATO partners, is now in its final days.
They have restrictions on such things as freedom of the press, human rights, and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan's visit to Cologne followed the dedication of a new massive mosque.
The largest population of Turks outside Turkey lives in the city.
The 25,000-member crowd was prevented from gathering in front of the mosque by police, who said it was a security concern, while many supporters gathered nearby to watch their president.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, spoke out, criticizing both Erdogan's actions and the German government's decision to allow him into the country.
The protest was a depiction of a visitor who was considered a hero by some German Turks and a ruler by others.

Flooding from Hurricane Rosa is a threat to Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, and Phoenix (Welcome Valley)
Tropical precipitation is rare in Arizona, but that is exactly what is expected to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa reach the Southwestern Desert, potentially creating a flood hazard.
In addition to the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, the National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah.
Rosa hopes to arrive late Monday to bring rain and direct flight over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that since 1950, only 10 of the tropical storms have been classified as tropical or subtropical within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Within 40 miles of the Arizona border, Katrina (1967) was a storm.
According to recent forecasts from the National Hurricane Center, rainfall will range from 2 to 4 inches, with amounts up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Central Rocks and the Great Basin, as well as other parts of the Desert Southwest, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with a total of up to 4 inches possible.
Rosa's rainfall may have been a gift because the area is vulnerable to flooding.
While flooding is a major concern, some of these rains may help as the Southwest now suffers from flooding.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the second-highest category of disability is shown over 40% of Arizona, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at a speed of 12 miles per hour. Rosa is a hurricane with sustained winds of 85 miles per hour.
The storm is weakened by contact with the cold waters of the Pacific.
As a result, it is expected to hit Mexico on Monday afternoon or late in the evening in the strength of the storm.
Heavy rainfall is possible in some areas of Mexico, which increases the risk of flooding.
From Baja California to northwestern Sonora, rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected, and up to 10 inches are possible, according to weather.com.
Rosa would then head north over Mexico as a tropical storm before falling on Arizona early Tuesday morning as a storm. By late Tuesday night, Rosa had headed to Arizona and headed south to Utah.
The worst of Rosa or its remnants appears to be heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the United States. Southwest Desert", according to the National Hurricane Center.

Kavanaugh "suffered, the evil, the anger", according to Trump, of the Democratic Party
Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia, "A vote for Judge Kavanaugh was a vote to reject the corrupt and abhorrent practices of the Democratic Party.
Trump said that during his election campaign, Kavanaugh "was plagued by the evil, hateful" Democratic Party.
In his testimony before Congress on Thursday, Kavanaugh strongly opposed Christine Blasey Ford's claim that she attacked him in the back as a teenager.
Ford spoke privately about his complaint throughout the trial.
Americans "saw Kavanaugh's beauty and goodness and courage" that day, the president said Saturday.
He told a West Virginia supportive audience, "A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most brilliant minds of our time, a judge with an excellent record of public service".
While discussing the importance of Republican involvement in the midterm elections, the President made a direct reference to Kavanaugh's choice.
One of the most important elections of our lives is five weeks.
I'm really running, even if I'm not", she says.
"That is why I am fighting for good candidates everywhere", he said.
The Democrats, according to Trump, are trying to "resist and disrupt".
A senior aide to the GOP leader told CNN that the first significant vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday.
The death toll from flooding and earthquakes in Indonesia is expected to rise
A major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, killing at least 384 people, many of whom were displaced when massive waves hit the beaches, according to authorities.
On Friday, hundreds of people were enjoying a festival on the beach in Palu in the evening, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) high hit the beach, killing many and crushing everything along the way.
The quake followed the quake with a magnitude of 7.5.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian BNPB emergency services, said in a statement in Jakarta that "most people were still enjoying their beach activities after the tsunami threat came yesterday and did not run early and became victims".
The tsunami "did not come by itself", Nugroho said, adding that it travelled over sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the beach, It was carrying cars, logs, houses, and everything else on land.
He said that many people were able to escape the flood by eating the trees.
At 24 centers in Palu, about 16,700 people were relocated.
Aerial images provided by the emergency department showed many buildings and shops collapsing, bridges collapsing and a temple surrounded by water.
The seaward harbor was shaken by earthquakes later on Saturday.
An area of 2.4 million people felt the series of earthquakes.
The energy generated by Friday's massive earthquake was nearly 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II, according to a statement from the Indonesian Bureau for Analysis and Technology (BPPT).
According to the report, the city's position at the edge of a long, narrow bay may have increased the tide.
Many homes, hospitals, shops, and hotels have been destroyed, according to Nugroho, who called the destruction "great".
He added that 540 people were injured while 29 were missing, and some bodies of people were found buried in the rubble of the collapsed buildings.
According to Nugroho, the damage and damage could have been over 300 kilometers (190 miles) above sea level north of Palu, in a place called Donggala, which is near the epicentre of the earthquake.
Donggala's communications "were so crippled without any information", according to Nugroho.
It has more than 300,000 inhabitants", according to a statement from the Red Cross, adding that its workers and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
"This has been going on for a long time, " they said. " But it may be worse".
Although officials said that waves came during the warning, the official on Saturday criticized the lack of reporting of a wave in Palu.
A man on the top floor of a building can hear the sudden warning cries of waves coming from people living on the street down the street in video footage posted on social media.
Within minutes, a wave of water flows over the beach, wiping out homes and cars.
The clip was not immediately confirmed by Reuters.
The earthquake and tsunami caused major power outages and disruptions to the Balkans, posing a challenge to authorities planning rescue operations.
According to authorities, the military has begun to bring cargo and supplies from Jakarta and elsewhere, but there is still a high demand for food and other necessities.
Only with help has the airport reopened in the city; it will remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo planned to visit the removal sites of Paul.
More than 800 people died in the Indonesian Tsunami.
It is so bad.
While traveling to the city of Palu from Donggala, where workers are taking refuge in the cottages installed on the campus of their office, World Vision staff saw scenes of devastation along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
They said they had seen many buildings destroyed, he said.
It is terrible.
Some complained that experienced international aid workers were banned from arriving in Palu despite the tragic start of disaster response by aid organizations.
If an emergency centre is designated as a national emergency zone, Indonesian laws allow money, supplies, and foreign workers to begin flowing there.
That did not happen.
"It remains a regional emergency", said Aulia Arriani, a member of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"We could open for international aid if the government said, 'Well, it's a civil crisis,' but there is no such thing as a crisis right now.
Friends and relatives of those still missing hoped that their loved ones would miraculously ease the sad news of natural disasters as they arrived in Palu on the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami.
A young boy was rescued from a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under garbage for two days, with her mother's body beside her.
On Sunday, rescuers were able to rescue a woman who had been trapped in garbage for two days with her mother's body.
Others were detained at the Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, his students.
I have my own emotional burden as a senior athlete, that's what he says.
Mr. Gendon recalled how he had eagerly sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were attending the beach party, in the hours following the rumor that the Roa Hotel had fallen among the terrorists.
Instead of two blue checkers, his messages received only one dust check mark.
"I believe it shows that no messages were sent", he says.
In Newport on the Levee, thieves stole $26,750 during the refill of the ATM
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, robbers took $26,750 from Brink's employee Friday morning as he refilled an ATM machine in Newport on the Levee.

Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Kanye West, the rapper, changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter, calling it "The celebrity of Kanye West".
Ye is West's 41-year-old moniker, and he used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of her Saturday Night Live show, which could kick off her new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who said the film was canceled "for emotional reasons".
West previously noted that the word had a religious meaning for him in addition to the abbreviation of his current professional name.
I believe Ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and the biblical meaning is oe, as West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of his upcoming album with Big Boy radio.
"I am you, I am us, we are.
Kanye went from "just one", to just "yes", a picture of our good, bad, confused, and everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are".
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
He is one of the popular singers who have changed their name, Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, but he announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former Western collaborator, also handled or lacked capital letters and a visual.
AMLO of Mexico vows not to use force on civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the future president of Mexico, has vowed never to launch military attacks on civilians as the country approaches 50 years of bloody retribution to students.
"Never order the military to detain Mexicans", Lopez Obrador swore on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza.
During the March of Marxist student revolts in Latin America, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful gathering in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people.
By providing monthly surveys and expanding the number of free public universities, Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth.
He says that youths are drawn to criminal activity because of unemployment and lack of educational opportunities.
The U.S. needs to double the A.I. money
According to entrepreneur and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple, because of China's strong presence in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its spending on research in the field.
The data came after various branches of the U.S. government created AI ads, despite the fact that the U.S. has no AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: it wants to be a leader in AI renewal by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget is a good place to start, because all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next AI crisis", Lee said.
According to Lee in an interview with CNBC this week, doubling the budget could increase the chances that the United States will have the next big AI revolution.
A book by Lee entitled "AI Superpowers: The CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in Face++, one of China's most popular AI businesses, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.
He developed an AI system that defeated the great American actor Othello in the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, later, he worked as an executive at Microsoft Research and became head of Google's China division.
Lee introduced the first U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the competition would be held to help identify these viewers.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often work hard to get government funding.
"It's not China that steals education leaders, it's institutions", Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired university windows to work on AI.
Changes to travel policies, according to Lee, could also contribute to U.S. AI efforts.
"I believe green cards should be automatically awarded to AI PhDs", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China submitted its Strategic Development Plan.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people in vocational education in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies do for American researchers, but the quality of educational work in China is low, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States The White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence, while the Department of Defense launched a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center with partners from industry and academia.
Furthermore, this month DARPA revealed a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
The NSF, meanwhile, is currently spending more than $100 million annually on AI research.
The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence issued the US order, but no action was taken on the moon.
In a referendum, Macedonians choose whether to change the country's name
In a vote on Sunday, Macedonia was asked whether it would support changing the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would end a longstanding conflict with Greece that had prevented Macedonia from applying for NATO and the European Union.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim on its territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
A decision between the two governments was reached in June based on the proposed new name, but national protesters say that doing so would reduce the ethnicity of the predominantly Slavic Macedonian people.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would vote in the referendum, and a reluctance to vote raised concerns that the vote would reach the 50% required for the vote to be approved.
The question on the referendum ballot reads: "Will you join NATO and the EU in accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a low price to pay for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia, to seek membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO.
I came today to vote for the future of the country, so that young Macedonians can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means it is safer for all of us, says Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have indicated that they will follow the election decision to make the decision.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
By 1 p.m., there were no reports of defects, according to the state election commission.
However, the total turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of voters voted.
"I came out to vote for my children because of our place in Europe", says Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko voted in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country, which will pave the way for NATO and the European Union membership on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje, pulling up seats in front of tents set up by those who would hold the vote.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads high, not the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor nation, but not without glory.
If they did not accept us as Macedonians, we could move to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian union.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will bring the most needed funding to Macedonia, which has more than 20% unemployment.
"I believe that most will vote in favour because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after his vote.
A "yes" vote would be "a sign of our future", he said.
According to a poll released last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the vote, far below the required number.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian Telma Television, found that 57% of voters planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
To be successful, at least 50 percent of the voters must participate in one election.
The Western-backed government would suffer its first major setback if the election failed since it became office in May last year.
Witness: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero is taking part in Brighton's full defence to score
Manchester City defeated Brighton 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, with goals from Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute seemed pretty simple.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentinian found a bus in the middle.
Before he cut into the pitch, he ran in front of three Brighton goalkeepers.
Four people in green shirts surrounded Aguero.
At the end of the Brighton box, he beat three opponents after pushing one of them away.
He then pushed a bus down Sterling Road to his left.
The Englishman used his first touch in the box to set up Aguero, who hit Brighton police officer Matthew Ryan with a right-handed shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some foot problems", city mayor Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked him into playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is exactly what happened.
We were lucky because he scored at that exact moment.
Sterling, however, gave the Sky Blues their first Premier League lead.
That was the goal in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguero scored the ball in the Brighton area.
He played well with the ball under left-back against Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the remote pole.
Before the back was towed, the Sky Blues hit the ball into the net.
At 12:55 p.m., City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League game on Tuesday at Sinsheim Rhein-Neckar-Arena.
Scherzer wants to be a villain.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there is little reason to reinforce another start.
But Scherzer is always competing hoping to win the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but if the Rockies, one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still in contention.
The Rockies had a chance to earn the wild-card spot in a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they were still looking for their first championship.
"Even though we play free, we can reach the line with the knowledge of the environment here in Denver and the crowd and the other team will play at the highest level of any side I will face this year".
Why would I want to compete in something like that?"
The Nationals have never named a starter for Sunday, but Scherzer said he is willing to come out on top.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, scored the bullpen session on Saturday and will stand at his usual break on Sunday.
This season, the Washington right-hander was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia
While discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections, President Trump alluded to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we've accomplished is on track in November.
Five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lives.
"I don't run, but I run very fast, so I'm everywhere to fight for the best candidates", he says.
"You see this tragic and horrific crisis of the Democrats, you see these are happening", Trump said.
And they are eager to regain power by any means necessary, as evidenced by their wickedness and wickedness.
They do not care who they harm or who they run to for power and authority; that is all they want, and we will not give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, are trying to "interfere and resist".
He described the Democrats as "aggressive, violent, mean, and dishonest" and added, "And you've seen it four days ago".
The audience was shocked when he specifically mentioned the Democratic senator who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
Remember his answer?
Have you put the card out?
Uh, uh, what.
The worst kind of evil language I have ever seen! Oh, wait! The fleshly tongue is evil.
It is no longer a public church, it is functioning.
People refuse to express their opinions
It was no surprise when the Momentum activists at my local party decided to punish me.
I mean, I'm just the deputy leader of the Labor Party recently to be notified that we're not allowed to speak our minds.
Because she was a staunch opponent of religious opposition, my fellow parliamentarian Joan Ryan had a similar situation.
Throwing my case has made me criticize my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Surprisingly, these were all issues that made Jeremy different from previous leaders: the importance of an economic policy, national security, and Europe.
We want to get together and encourage meetings, according to the announcement for the Nottingham East Labor meeting on Friday.
The General Assembly meetings on Friday night were similar for most of my eight years as a Labor deputy.
Sadly, that is not the sound of many meetings today, and if there were "kind, gentle" policies, they have long been forgotten.
The Labour Party's opposition to the opposition is clearer and all views are assessed in the interests of the party leader.
This started after Jeremy was elected as leader, when my friends I previously thought were equals in politics started to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions I disagree with, whether it's national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I show up publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - there is an attack on social media of hate calling for my removal, criticizing the centre's politics, and declaring that I should not be a member of the Labour party.
That is not just my observation.
I know that I am in a better position than other of my employees because so much information was made about me as a politician.
I am amazed at the skill and energy of those workers who endure everyday sexual or racial discrimination before they repent.
The classification of corruption is one of the tragic tragedies of this political era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour party should promote an environment of tolerance.
In fact, our party has become increasingly more specific with each "unreliable" show and change in selection criteria.
Over the past two years, I have received many tips that tell me to keep my head down, to keep my voice down, and to be "good".
But that was not the reason I got involved in politics in the first place.
As a result of the Thatcher government's negligence, which led to the demolition of my entire classroom, I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, Since then, whether as a local politician or a government minister, I have worked to improve public services for those most in need.
My speech was not a secret, even during the recent election.
No one in Nottingham East could have had a little bit of a dark side about my political stance and the parties I disagree with in the current administration.
All I want to say to the individual supporters of Friday's vote is that I don't understand the need to waste time and energy on my commitment to the Labour leadership as the country moves towards a Brexit that could affect our families, businesses, and our public services.
However, my main message is to my constituents, whether they are Labour supporters or not, not to the Nottingham Momentum: I am honoured to serve you, and I promise that no amount of threats of expulsion or political policies will stop me from working for your benefit.
The mayor of Nottingham East is Chris Leslie
Ai 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is not going up
There is no doubt that Ayr should have won this remarkable Tennent match in today's Premiership, despite the fact that two previous attempts had somewhat ended the final goal.
These were not the ten who were seated at the table.
The home team eventually won because of their high defense as well as their superior chances, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be happy.
He said, "I should be content, our games have been tested to date, and they have not been unclean.
"Ayr deserves credit for being more risky than we are", says Robyn Christie of Melrose.
Frazier Climo's turn in Grant Anderson's 14-minute effort gave Ayr the lead, but Rory Hughes, the Scottish side that the Warriors had occupied after receiving his yellow card, helped Melrose win the game on an unconverted effort.
Climo moved Ayr's chances to a penalty before the goal and converted a penalty kick before halftime to put Ayr on a 17-5 run.
However, Melrose's start was strong in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's effort, which Baggot added a twist, cut the line at the ai arm.
After a delay caused by a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be sacked, Ayr jumped off a better shot thanks to Stafford McDowall's attempt which Climo won.
After a period of intense power, Ayr captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose repaid the player's extra salary in an unconverted effort by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team fought again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored from the next penalty line at the bottom of Ayr's forward moul.
When Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry to run for the home team's fifth attempt, Climo added the conversion, as he did as soon as he started again.
Star of Still Game appears set for new jobs in the restaurant business
After learning that he had been appointed director of a licensed restaurant, Still Game player Ford Kieran seemed ready to enter the hotel.
The 56-year-old is featured on his favorite BBC show, Jack Jarvis, which he did with his comedic partner Greg Hemphill and stars in.
The upcoming ninth season is the final show, as the creators claim, and Kiernan appears to be getting ready for life after Craiglang.
He is the director of Adriftmorn Limited, according to official records.
Although the Scottish Sun source suggested that the athlete wanted to join Glasgow's "restaurant business", the reporter refused to comment on the report.
Polivia believes the court will reopen the Pacific because "the sea is ours"
In La Paz, the crew guard a naval base to be flown on the water.
A blue flag is flown over public buildings.
The phrase is painted on seafaring sites from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon: "The sea is legal for us.
It's your responsibility to recover.
In the midst of a locked-in Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a devastating 19th-century resource crisis is still fresh, as is the desire to sail again through the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations may be at their highest in years as Bolivia awaits the international court's decision on its case on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"According to Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla, the country is moving forward with a sense of calm and unity and, of course, is looking forward to a happy outcome.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's ruling on major screens across the country, with the hope that the court in The Hague will satisfy Bolivia's claim that Chile should consider granting Polivia jurisdiction at sea after years of deliberations.
Bolivia's president Evo Morales, who is up for re-election next year, also has a lot to choose from at the end of Monday.
"He was about to return to the Pacific Ocean", he said at the end of August.
However, some scholars believe that the court may not seem able to make a decision for Polivia - and even if it does, little change is made.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no authority to grant Chile territory and says that the outcome of any talks will not be affected.
The fact that the ICJ's decision came six months after the final arguments revealed that the case was "not complicated", according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And, rather than expanding Bolivia's ambition, the last four years may have been a comeback.
"The Bolivian authorities are now seizing the issue of maritime access", says Zárate.
He said Morales' words had destroyed any good Chilean heart.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate for some time, but it will be very difficult to do so afterwards.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged embassies.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, representing Polivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions are unusual in that they are made early.
Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" on Monday, as well as the opportunity to "end 139 years of conflict and shared interests", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most prominent leaders, was using the maritime issue as a political tool.
"Bolivia can never give up its right of entry into the Pacific Ocean", he said.
"The decision gives us the opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is not a real possibility unless it can rely on the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his country would never be able to disarm first if Washington could not be trusted.
Ri addressed the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep promises made during a meeting of the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
More than three months after his meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be ahead in the resumption of the suspended nuclear diploma.
Ri believes it is a "pipe dream" that the continued sanctions and American opposition to a peace treaty will bring the north to its knees.

Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump wants a second meeting.
However, there is doubt about Pyongyang's reliability in providing weapons that it seems to believe is the only way to ensure its security.
In preparation for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, Pompeo is expected to travel to Pyongyang next month.

Don't anticipate if you want to expand your hat collection or block the entire sun.
The SS19 collection model show by Valentino and Thom Browne featured a number of spectacular covers that delighted the crowd of Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, fashion hats have been uploaded to Instagram, and these designers have been demonstrating their amazing creations down the street.
A brightly colored, brownish, leather-like hat that covered the heads of the models was Valentino's signature.
The jewels, the magic hats, and even the cotton cloth that were in the top of your head were not made to warm you.
Just in time for Halloween, Thom Browne also unveiled a number of unusual masks.

Some of the items were made with melted ice cream and scuba diving equipment with a snorkel and glasses.
And if you want to keep making a great fashion statement, you're in luck.
According to regular viewers, large caps will soon appear on the highways near you.
The large caps follow behind "La Bomba", the long-sleeved and two-legged wide-sleeved cap that was seen on celebrities such as Emily Ratajkowski and Rihanna.
The computer tag behind the inappropriate hat that was posted on social media, installed another giant creature under the sewers - a beach sack almost the same size as the swimsuit they were wearing.
The flaming purple bag was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week, decorated with a white leather suit and dress.
Renowned author Luke Armitage told FEMALE: 'I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags on the highway for next summer - the designer has made a huge impact that will make it difficult to ignore the demand for large appliances.'
John Edward: Language skills are needed for the world's citizens
Individual and collective success in sport, art, music, and other local endeavors has only boosted the quality of Scotland's independent schools, which continued in 2018 with another impressive set of test results.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these independent schools, representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service for their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their roles as citizens of the world.
We see modern languages that remain popular and the need for choice in schools as part of an education that can design and implement a specialized curriculum.
"Talking to a man in a language he understands goes to his head", said Nelson Mandela.
"Talking to a man in a language he understands goes to his head".
It is a strong reminder that when it comes to building relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely on English.
The top-level languages are the highest-ranked independent schools, according to this year's test results.
A total of 68% of students who learned a foreign language received a high A score.
Data from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72% of students achieved a high A score in Mandarin, while 72% of those who learned German, 69% of those who learned French, and 63% of those who learned Spanish also achieved A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as a necessary skill for children and young people in the future.
These languages hold the same status as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects as a subject of choice in independent schools and beyond.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 percent of the reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies were due to a lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills have become increasingly important to prepare young people for their future careers.
With many job opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in an international world.
Anyone who has learned a second language will have a future career credit regardless of what career they choose thanks to such a lifelong talent.
A multilingual person always has an advantage over the competition since they can quickly communicate with people from other countries.
A YouGov survey of over 4,000 British people in 2013 found that 15% of people who only speak French can speak fluently, with the remaining 75% of adults without the ability to have a conversation in a foreign language.
For the benefit of today's youth, it is vital to finance language education now.
Students will be more likely to find useful jobs if they are fluent in multiple languages, especially in developing languages.
The languages taught in each school differ in Scotland.
While some schools will focus on learning traditional modern languages, others will teach students in languages that are expected to be most important for the UK by the year 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Independent schools and professional teachers can offer a variety of languages, regardless of your child's interests.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing students with the learning environment and tools they need to achieve, regardless of the future.
The importance of languages for the future of the nation in the global business environment cannot be denied now, and they must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be called "international congregations", in fact.
For Scottish youth, independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity, and excellence.
That is important.

Sunday in San Diego, LeBron will make his Lakers debut
LeBron James's first start for the Los Angeles Lakers is coming soon, with fans eagerly awaiting.
James will appear in court at the start of the Lakers-Denver Nuggets tour on Sunday, according to coach Luke Walton.
However, it is not known how many minutes he will actually play.
Walton said on the Lakers' official website that "it will be more than one and less than 48".
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted James may be playing in a few minutes.
James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule earlier this week.
"Now that I'm working, I don't need to play games before I get ready", she says.
YouTube Channel for Trump's West Virginia Rally
In Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight, President Donald Trump launched a series of publicity campaigns.
Trump will make five trips over the next week, and travel to states that support him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump is trying to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections as he has postponed the valid vote for his decision to replace the Supreme Court's candidacy as Republicans could lose control of Congress if elections are held in November.
What time is Trump tonight in West Virginia, and how can you watch online?
The trumpet convention in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, September 29, 2018.
Below is a live ad from the Trump campaign in West Virginia on YouTube.
The trumpet is likely to speak about Brett Kavanaugh's trial this week, which escalated riots over allegations of sexual misconduct and held the vote for Senate approval for a week during the FBI investigation.
However, the main goal of this attack was to help the Republicans gain power in the upcoming November election.
According to Reuters, the presidential campaign said the five goals were intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans fight to protect and expand their majority in both the Senate and House".
As we enter the busy election season, a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters that he did not want to mention that "control of Congress is critical to his plan to visit as many states as possible".
The evening's rally, which is planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, will likely attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time last month, the Trump administration won West Virginia by more than 40 percent in 2016.
The trumpet is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate who is running late in the election.
According to Reuters, political scientist Simon Haeder of West Virginia University said, "It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to force him into the election".
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA struggles to maintain their ambition to move to singles on Sunday
After the three-part sessions, Saturday's four-part session was probably exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Weightlifting is a perfect sporting concept, but one that athletes truly believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Where do they think they are now?
"They might eat but now they're four, so we're carrying that as a little force, I guess", Jordan Spieth said as he walked away from the field for the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, to be served on four meals and then twelve more.
The Americans, as Spieth points out, believe there is a bit of wind in their cruise, and they have many reasons to hope, not the least of which is Spieth's game with Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them had three possible points.
From tee to green, Spieth is unstoppable and has risen to the top.
When they did it with Thomas, two down by two, scoring a score of four, they did not shake the joy that increased during his cycle.
A similar cry, the kind that clearly shows that the American team is still there, was expressed in response to his score that gave the winner the 15th hole.
"You just have to dig deep and focus on your own game", Spieth advises.
Then all these boys were left.
Make a mark on the 18 holes.
Only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup champions, ate more than Spieth and Thomas two days earlier.
The quirky but beautiful duo from Europe has a full four-year recording career.
The only team that didn't have a bogey on Saturday afternoon was "Moliwood", but they avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and nine o'clock on Friday.
Fleetwood and Molinari will be favourites to secure a European victory when the sun sets on Le Golf National due to the result of that run and how their enthusiasm seems to flow into this noisy crowd.
More than a few holes at a time.
However, speaking of the glory of Europe is a matter of time.
Sergio Garcia, the four-time morning champion, was quickly made by Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson when I was with Alex Noren.
The Spaniard and the Swede were never close to getting out of the hole where they placed them on the front nine thanks to the bogey and the two-two.
On Sunday, however, no one digs you out of your pit.
The interactions between pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a plan can change quickly to make the four balls and the four so interesting to watch closely.
The European championship has been much better as a team so far and the lead has been prominent towards the final, but this quarterfinal also showed the strength of the American team for the fight that some have questioned, especially in the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup on the final day 10-6
After winning four games and four games on Saturday, Europe will advance to the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 win over the United States.
With two wins over a Tiger Woods campaign, the motivators Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari moved their numbers to Le Golf National in the capital.
On the morning of the four balls, European team Thomas Bjorn beat a non-league American team to win the series 3-1 and attempt to win the trophy they had made at Hazeltine two years earlier.
The Americans were more than four-way, winning two games, but were unable to reduce the deficit.
To keep the Cup, Jim Furyk's team needed eight meals from each of the 12 games on Sunday.
Fleetwood was the first European to win four singles titles, and he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after an impressive finish, became only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four singles from their first four matches.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then gelled superbly to beat a deflated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who struggled in two Saturday games, sometimes showed a strong showing, but now has 19 of his 29 balls and four games, including seven straight, down.
The world's top two golfers, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, were led by 2&1 by Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson, who rested for four balls in the morning.
On a beautiful day with a wind in the southwest of Paris, Europeans were not on their way.
Jordan Spieth, a three-time champion, and Justin Thomas set the standard for America on Saturday with two meals each.
In four balls, they defeated Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2-1, and after falling on the first two holes to four, they came back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history have a team come back from a four-way tie in each group, but as holders, only Furyk's team has managed to retain the trophy.
However, after coming second for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seemed to have failed them.
North Korea rejects the idea of disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the country's suspicions about continued sanctions have grown in the United States and that the country has no way of delivering its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
North Korea has taken "excellent actions" over the past year, according to Ri Yong Ho, including halting nuclear tests and weapons, demolishing the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, he added, "We do not see a similar response from the US.
"Without faith in the United States, there would be no faith in our national security, and in such a situation, we would never be able to be shut down first".
While Ri repeated longstanding criticism from North Korea about Washington's opposition to a "spontaneous" denuclearization policy that would reward North Korea for taking minor steps, his statement seemed crucial in not rejecting the unilateral sanctions as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri said in a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the US president's first meeting with a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, Kim promised to work toward "correcting the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised a commitment to North Korea's security.
The United States has said that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons before North Korea can officially declare the 1950-1953 Korean War.
In addition, Washington has rejected proposals to ease international sanctions against North Korea.
To achieve their goals with boldness, the United States first pushes for a truce and increases the pressure through sanctions, even in opposition to "the declaration of the end of hostilities", Ri said.
The idea that punishment can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream of those who know nothing about us
The point, however, is that constant punishment makes us less trustworthy.
Ri did not mention the upcoming second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the US president had called earlier this week at the UN.
Ri did not mention the upcoming second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the US president had dismissed earlier this week at the UN: "The destruction of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a permanent level had South Korea been the party in this case of the destruction rather than the US.
Ri spoke at the UN last year, but this year's speech was a very different tone: the General Assembly said that North Korea would eventually launch rockets into the United States after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rock man" on a deadly mission.
The bomber, which last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his ability to conduct a UN disarmament operation this year but argued that much work needed to be done and that sanctions should continue until North Korea withdraws.
Trump said Wednesday he didn't have time to finish this and it didn't matter if it was two years, three years, or five months.
China and Russia have said that the UN should reward Pyongyang for its actions by the Security Council.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations on Thursday, the Security Council said: "The Security Council sanctions must be vigorously enforced and sustained until we reach completion, completion, and ratification.
Since 2006, the Security Council has united in increasing sanctions against North Korea in an effort to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missions.
Pompeo met Ri at the United Nations, and after the General Assembly, he said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his recent trip has been very successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, only North Korea would punish him within hours for "going on like a dog".
In a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a nuclear weapons facility along with a nuclear strike if the US "implements a similar strategy".
He said Kim told him that he sought "similar plans" as Trump's promised security in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn the importance of lack of rest
This year, Harvard University launched a new course that requires all students to get enough sleep to counter the growing fear of studying by caffeine-fueled 'all-nighters.'
One student found that students at the world's top universities often lack an understanding of the basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Polytechnic and Women's Hospital, who believes it to be the first of its kind in America.
She was inspired to start the course after giving an introduction to the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
'In the end, one girl came up and said: 'How can I hear this now, at my age?'
She said no one explained the importance of sleep to her, which surprised her, she told the Telegraph.
The course, which was first launched this year, teaches students the basics of good sleep habits to improve well-being and performance in academic and sporting settings.
The organization decided to launch the course after finding out that students are severely sleep deprived during the week, according to Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief medical officer.
The hour-long lesson includes a series of interactive exercises.
Students can learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, the importance of nighttime routine, and other topics by clicking on objects in a living room image, including coffee cups, screens, shoes, and books.
Participants in another group have been informed that a lack of regular sleep increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The participants are then encouraged to reflect on their daily routines by means of a campus map and associated signs.
We know that the behavior of students will not change quickly.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking' Professor Czeisler said.
He added that modern technology and the increasing weight on students means that lack of sleep has become a serious problem, He said that the culture of pride in "dragging a person all night long" remains.
The student's "hidden weapon" against depression, fatigue, and anxiety should ensure adequate sleep, according to him It can also help them avoid weight gain due to lack of sleep causing the brain's hunger response, which keeps them hungry.
After taking one of Professor Czeisler's seminars last year during his freshman year at Harvard, 19-year-old Californian Raymond So, who specializes in chemistry and physical biology, helped the professor create the course.
He said that the course changed his outlook and motivated him to advocate for an entire campus course.
He hoped that the next step would be to require all graduate students to complete a modular study plan before enrolling in the chosen university.
Prof. Czeisler advised students to think about setting a bedtime and wake up time and to consider the adverse effects of "blue light", which is emitted by electrical appliances and LED lights and can interfere with your circadian cycle and make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocked Gerrard's son out
Steven Gerrard's team had another case of Dolly Menga's team's relegation that resulted in Rangers being beaten 1-0 at Livingston.
Ibrox wanted to win on the road for the first time since defeating St. Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's side held that off, giving Gerrard a second-place finish in 18 games as manager and dropping his eight-eighth team behind Hearts, who are currently leading the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Seven minutes into the half, Menga scored, and the Rangers never got a chance to score.
Rangers are now in sixth place, while Livingston is moving up to third and Hibernian is the only other side on goal difference.
In addition, linebacker Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury when he appeared to have been shot from behind, which would have been more dangerous for Rangers.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that easily defeated Ayr to advance to the Betfred Cup semifinals.
The Livi 11 that Holt used to defeat Hearts last week drew their teams to the opposite end of the table. Holt, on the other hand, started the game on the same line.
Despite Livingston's large ball, the Rangers still had a chance in the possession.
Menga's first break was to have Scott Pittman reach Allan McGregor's goal in the opening two minutes, but the centre-half missed his chance to score.
Captain Craig Halkett was caught with a deep kick by Keaghan Jacobs, while Alan Lithgow, a guard, was able to shoot a wide shot into the rear pole.
The Rangers took the lead, but their last-quarter effort seemed more motivated by hope than confidence.
After a quarter-hour fight with Steven Lawless, Alfredo Morelos likely felt he should have been fined, but the judge, Steven Thomson, ignored his objections.
Rangers scored just two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly struggled with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's bat.
Although Levi's 34th-minute goal came in the game's penultimate round, no one could deny they deserved it because of their military career.
The Rangers were no longer able to handle a deep set of Jacobs.
When Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calmly picking Menga up for a simple result, Scott Arfield did not respond.
Gerrard was forced to retire, Coulibaly's replacement for Ryan Kent, and the change was almost a factor when the wing blew over Morelos, while the spectacular Cave ran out of its line to block.
Livingston, however, urged the visitors to play their favorite sport, with Lithgow and Halkett throwing the long ball into the long ball.
Holt's team could have expanded to the lock, but McGregor made a successful save to repel Jacobs before Lithgow moved far from the corner.
Rangers rep Glenn Middleton was given another old penalty when he met Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger Counter
The following is a quote from our "Sunday morning Amanac": The future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany on September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and READ...
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, which later became the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Counter has become a subject of both science as well as popular culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which the confused cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans adapted:
People: 'What is that?'
Rogers: "The Geiger Counter is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
You can still hear the effects of radio waves on rocks when you listen to these ears.
Evans: Say, "Sorry, it's coming up!"
'Hans' Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the new creature that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to recognize malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill harmful cells
A vaccine that trains the immune system to detect harmful cells is part of the treatment
The procedure involves removing immune cells from a patient and replacing them in the laboratory
When a protein common to many tumors is injected again, they can "see" it
In patients with various cancers, a model vaccine gives positive results.
One patient who received the vaccine, which trains the body's immune system to detect the tumor, was given 18 months to recover from ovarian cancer.
The process involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the lab so that they can "see" a protein called HER2 present in many tumors, relaying the changed cells back into the patient.
In Bethesda, Maryland, at the US National Cancer Institute, Professor Jay Berzofsky said: "Our studies show that we have vaccines that show a lot of promise".
According to Prof. Berzofsky, HER2 "promotes the growth of various cancers", including breast, ovarian, breast, and colorectal cancers.
One type of leukemia has been successfully treated by similar means, including removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells.
After his appearance on SNL, Kanye West was featured in a Trump performance while watching a MAGA hat.
It Did Not Work
After a long performance on Saturday Night Live in which he praised the United States, Kanye West received a laugh from the audience in the room. President Donald Trump spoke out and said he would run for office in 2020.
After singing Ghost Town, his third song of the evening, while playing a Make America Great cap, he attacked the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"Whenever I talk to a white person, they often say, Trump is racist, so how do you like him?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago", she says.
SNL began the show with a short story called Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star snapped at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the sexual abuse of Christine Blasey Ford.
Chris Rock, a musician, posted the Western video on social media despite not being released.
It is unclear whether Rock planned the ad to be Western.
Moreover, the West complained to the crowd that he faced hardships behind his hat.
They were bothering me behind the scenes.
Do not go out wearing that hat, they said.
They were hurting me!
The Washington Examiner said that he said, "And then they say I'm in a sunken place.
"Do you want to see the lake?" he confessed, "do my Superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do". Do you want the world to be better off?
Test the love".
He received at least two boos from the audience, and the SNL cast seemed upset, according to a Variety report One of the audience members said: "The whole room was so quiet".
Rapper Kanye West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who had recently lost her boyfriend, Mac Miller.
West's performance of I Love It while dressed as a Perrier Bottle confused many.
Candace Turner, the leader of the conservation organization TPUSA, tweeted in support of the West: In honor of one of the most courageous souls: I appreciate you leading the MOB.
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "human and so interesting".
"But I have decided NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe is accepting and expressing ideas that hurt my community.
He is free.
We are, too, he continued.
The rapper revealed on Twitter before the performance that he had changed his identity and is now "the celebrity of Kanye West".
He was not the first musician to change their name; Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy, preceded him.
Snoop Dogg, a fellow singer, went by the name Snoop Lion, but Prince, the legacy of old music, changed his name to a label before becoming a musician formerly known as Prince.
The closure of Belfast's restaurant leads to the charge of attempted murder
After a man was arrested on Friday at a restaurant in east Belfast, a 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder.
According to authorities, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is scheduled to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will investigate the charges.

For her role as Jon Snow who uses swords in HBO's bloody mediaeval fantasy series Game of Thrones, Kit Harington is well known.
However, the 31-year-old singer has criticized the macho hero cliché, saying that because of such characters on TV, young men often believe they should be hard to respect.
In her speech to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit expressed her belief that "something is wrong" and asked how to deal with the issue of male poisoning during the post-#MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old Game of Thrones star, admitted that she had "very strong" feelings about handling the matter.
"What have we done wrong? I am now in a state of shock.
What did we teach the boys as they grew up about the challenge they face today?
Because of her terrible personality, Kit thinks she might abandon television to raise poisonous boys.
He continued: What is common and what is taught?
What is being taught to teenagers on TV and on the streets that encourages them to portray this particular aspect of the male?
How can we improve that, in my opinion, is one of the most important issues of our day?
There is something wrong with the young men.'
When the Game of Thrones game comes out late next summer, he also said in the interview that he would not do any previews or a sequel since he had "made it with horses".
Starting in November, Kit will be working as the title character on a new adaptation of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about an actor and his brother thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing that ever came out of Game of Thrones.
"I found my family in the future and my life moving forward because I met my wife at this show", she says.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose plays Ygritte, who is Kit's favorite character Jon Snow.
In Scotland, on the grounds of Leslie's family estate, the couple married in June 2018.
HIV/aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
According to recent data, the number of Chinese people living with HIV and AIDS has risen by 14%.
Health officials estimate that the country's population of patients is more than 820,000.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A change from the previous chapter was a change in many new chapters that had spread through sex.
Historically, HIV spread rapidly through contaminated blood in some regions of China.
However, the number of people infected with HIV by this method has nearly disappeared, Chinese health officials said at a meeting in Yunnan province.
Yet, 100,000 people in China are infected with HIV and AIDS each year.
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a serious problem among the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality was condemned in China in 1997, there are reports of widespread racism against LGBT people.
According to surveys, between 70 and 90 percent of gay men will eventually marry women because of their national beliefs.
In such partnerships, sexual protection is often insufficient, contributing to the spread of disease.
In an effort to address the problem, the Chinese government has committed to providing access to HIV treatment to all since 2003.
Maxine Waters has denied that the staff mined the statements of GOP senators, denouncing 'terrible lies' and 'conspiracy'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters criticized allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information of three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages on Saturday.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were being driven by "ultra-right wing" groups and websites.
"Bible, lies, and lies are more detestable", Waters said in a tweet.
According to reports, the information provided included American home addresses and phone numbers. Sens. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate committee announcement on charges of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The league came into existence after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address was used to identify the source of posts that linked to the Waters office and revealed the identity of a Waters staff member, according to Hill.
"This allegation of misinformation is completely false and completely false", Waters said.
"My employee, his information, personal information, and security are at risk because of these misleading and deceptive statements, in no way caused the leak of these statements".
This allegation of corruption is completely false and is a direct lie.
Waters' comments have sparked outrage online, including from former White House secretary Ari Fleischer.
This refusal is anger, according to Fleischer.
"That means he is not old enough to be a member of Congress.
"That means he is not old enough to be a member of Congress.
They cannot be stubborn.
They should not speculate about the accused's motives.
They need to feel at ease and at ease.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for his outrage at Thursday's trial.
On Twitter, Omar Navarro, a Republican who is trying to change the waters in the midst of the elections, also shared his views.
"A lot if it's true", he tweeted.
Appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies have been notified of these misinformation, Waters said.
We will ensure that criminals are identified and legally sanctioned for any act that harms and could endanger any person and everyone on my team, he added.
Johnny English Strikes Again is a spoof featuring Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to explore Brexit attributes in any new British film, and this seems to be the case with the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Would the country's new export opportunity be a personal insult to the cleanliness of the garbage?
In any case, Johnny English's license to be a cheerleader, skinny, up-and-coming actor has been renewed for a second time - his name, more than anything else, identifies him as a general comedian designed for non-English-speaking territories to watch films.
He is, of course, the secret agent of horror, despite his bizarre beauty-improving performances, who has a clouseau score, a drummer Mr Bean, and a young boy who contributed to the theme of the Chariots of Fire musical at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He was also inspired by the traveler and world of the mysterious character Atkinson played in the forgotten TV show Barclaycard, who left chaos on his way.
The new JE game has a few interesting moments.
I like Johnny English going out in a helicopter wearing a modern-day suit of armor, and soon the rotor blade will stick to his hat.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown, but comedy tends to feel weak and bizarre, especially because the "old" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as a defining element.
The comedy tends to be more about children than adults, and Johnny English's flashbacks are not as prolific and focused as Atkinson's slow-paced films like Bean.
The current belief is that Britain is in a serious crisis.
To the delight of the agent on the job, a hacker has accessed Britain's most secretive spy network, revealing the details of all British agents in the field - a sad fact for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final conclusion for a proud and dangerous prime minister who has suffered a total political disruption: Emma Thompson does her best in this Theresa-May attitude, but she doesn't have much to do with the story.
His advisers told him that since every powerful man who was overweight, he should bring someone from retirement.
And that means the trouble Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a private institution but is giving classes on how to be a spy: some interesting gags here, like English is offered by the School of Rock-style spying academy.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency interview, where he was reunited with his former teammates Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commanding officer, a position that has somewhat lost Vicki Pepperdine.
Therefore, the Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service are suddenly back at work and driving on Olga Kurylenko's amazing femme fatale Ophelia Bhuletova.
Special computer scientist Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, believes he can solve the UK's digital problems, which the prime minister may fall under his spell.
English and Bough begin their own bizarre adventures: pretending to be restaurant workers, they open a French restaurant; they cause a riot to try to get them aboard the luxurious Volta boat; and English causes a riot when he tries to use a Virtual Reality head to navigate the Volta house.
The final series definitely pulls all the strings, but like the fun and noise it is, there's a lot of kids TV about it.
The moderate good.
And, like Johnny English's earlier films, I can't help but wonder: why can't the British cinema give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly reflects his talent?
Labour has rejected a plan to employ British workers four days a week for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Movement is considering a radical plan to see Britons working four days a week and paying for five.
According to reports, the party wants company executives to pass on investments from crisis management (AI) to employees by giving them extra leave.
Employees would get a three-day weekend while still receiving the same income.
According to the sources, the concept is 'similar' to the party's economic strategy and aims to deploy the country to workers.
The Trade Union Congress has approved four days a week as a way for workers to focus on economic change.
According to a senior Labour Party source, The Sunday Times: 'A policy review will be released before the end of the year.'
'The four-day workweek is a trend that develops in line with the party's economic recovery strategy towards workers, as well as the overall strategy of the business sector.'
The Labour Party was not the first to support such a proposal, and the Green Party announced four days a week for the duration of its 2017 presidential campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not fully support the demand.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: 'A separate working week is not a party policy, and the party does not envisage it.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party meeting last week to clarify his vision for a social and economic reform.
McDonnell said he was eager to regain control from the failed administration and the commercialist in the utilities.
Current shareholders in public companies cannot recover all their shares under the director's plans, as the Labour government can make 'deposits' based on mistakes.
He also approved plans to give employees seats and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to give them 10% equity in private companies to exchange for £500 in shares annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discussed whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh would change their minds
The FBI investigation into allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote in his Supreme Court decision by less than a week, raising the question of whether the agency's investigation results could entice any Republican senator to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minute" investigative journalist Scott Pelley asked Republicans Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find anything to persuade them to change their minds.
Kennedy emerged more openly than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, that's what I meant", Kennedy replied.
"I said in front of the court, 'I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.'"
When that accusation came up, I called him and asked, 'Did you?'
He was firm, firm, and unshakable.
Graham's vote, however, seems to have been a setback.
"I have a positive attitude toward Brett Kavanaugh, and it takes a strong decision to change my mind", she says.
"Dr. Ford, I'm not sure what's going on, but I know this: Brett strongly denied, Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one has said anything that can be proven".
He is 36 years old.
I don't see any change".
What is the Global Citizen Event, and how has it helped to alleviate poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Event, an annual music festival with a remarkable ensemble of performers with a common mission: to eradicate poverty worldwide.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will draw thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to appreciate the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the real goal of the vision of ending poverty completely by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a follow-up to the World Poverty Project, an international media organization that aims to eradicate poverty through mass struggle.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concertgoers must complete a series of activities, or "activities" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other means of helping to publicize their goal of ending poverty.
But in just 12 years, what is the success of Global Citizen?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to persuade them to need an action, or is it just another issue called "clicktivism" - people believing they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "activities" from its sponsors since 2011, advocating for various reasons.
According to the report, these actions prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group said 390 liabilities and media outlets resulting from its conduct, that at least $10 billion had already been committed or financed.
According to the group, guaranteed funds now have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Power of Nutrition, a UK-based collaborative agreement of business and practitioners who decided to commit to "helping children grow to their full potential", has pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate the country's imbalance after receiving 4,700 twitter posts from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, investors, national governments, and Earth Citizens like you, we can make the inequality of food imbalance a part of history", Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition ambassador, told a live concert audience in London in April 2018.
The group also noted that after more than 5,000 moves to promote better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called the Health Force, which will provide food for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of his frequently asked questions, "What makes you think we can eradicate absolute poverty?"
The earthly citizen responded: "It is a long and difficult road, and we will fail and fail at times.
But, like civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Some of the performances taking place this year in New York include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe The event will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. Navy could be used to "block" Russian power transfers, according to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell
Washington could use its Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian influence from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, according to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as reported by the Washington Observer.
Zinke said Russia's involvement in Syria, especially where it is working on the legitimate government's call, was a sign for the country to explore new strong markets.
According to reports, he said, "I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to share energy as they do in eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe.
And, according to the agency, there are guidelines for handling.
The United States has this power, with our Flow, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy does not flow into the market, he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at a rally hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He then mimicked Washington's routes to Russia and Iran, and observed that they were identical.
He described Russia as a "one-trick" and an oil-dependent economy, saying "the economic option for Iran and Russia, more or less, is to use and replace oil".
The data comes from the Trump administration's intention to increase U.S. natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, as a more affordable option for European consumers.
In that context, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, have urged Germany to step away from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, in Trump's words, turned Berlin into a "Moscow captivity".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a commercial venture.
According to the Kremlin, Washington's strong opposition to the project is only economically stimulating and an example of unfair competition.
"After a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said, "I believe we share the idea that energy cannot be used as a power tool and consumers should be able to choose who they buy.
Germany has confirmed its support for the project despite criticism from other countries over the US stand.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading industrial organization, has urged the United States not to come to strong EU policies and agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
""I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will be "very serious" to run for president in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday she would "look closely" at the presidential race after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed his intention to run for president during the town of Holyoke, Massachusetts.
According to The Hill, she said that "it's time for women to go to Washington and rebuild our fractured empire, and include a woman on top.
"After November 6, I will consider running for president".
During the attack, Warren criticized President Donald Trump, saying that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Yes, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, according to a poll released Thursday, most Warren residents do not believe he should run in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 58% of Massachusetts voters "may" believe the senator should not run.
The support for such a run was 32 percent.
Former Governor Deval Patrick received the most voter support, with 38% supporting a cause and 48% opposing it.
Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders are two other top Democratic candidates negotiating for a 2020 campaign.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a formal decision in January.
Track Palin's PTSD as reported by Sarah Palin at the Donald Trump convention
Track Palin, 26, served in Iraq for a year after signing in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"What my own father is going through, what he is coming back to, I can share with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers have come back to", he told the audience at the Donald Trump, Tulsa, Oklahoma, meeting.
"You come back a little different, they come back with a little bit of a smile, they come back and wonder if there is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and soldiers and all other members of the military have given to the country", says Palin, her son and other veterans".
Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, said he was arrested Monday and charged with assaulting a domestic woman, obstructing reports of domestic violence, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting the challenge to the new policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have joined a court challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or forced fleeing.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief in Washington on Friday in support of a refugee challenging the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the case is Grace v. The American Civil Liberties Union's August lawsuit challenging the government's unpublished policies.
He said that his "partner and his violent sons" had abused him, but U.S. officials refused his asylum application.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for states supporting Grace El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which receive the largest number of refugees in the United States, were identified as countries suffering from domestic violence and domestic violence.
The new US asylum law overturned the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allowed undocumented foreigners to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
According to District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine, the new policy "does not take into account decades of state, federal, and international law".
"Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be considered on the facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such a ban violates the case", the friend-of-the-court brief said.
The lawyer also argued briefly that the policy of excluding immigrants is detrimental to the American economy, saying they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and "provide valuable employment".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to people fleeing domestic violence and domestic violence.
"Asylum is open to people fleeing their native country because of persecution or fear of their race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular group or political order", Sessions said in his June 11th press release.
Asylum is not intended to solve all the problems, even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts in Palu are highly intensive as the death toll in the search for survivors has more than doubled
For survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
"It was very, very humorous", says Risa Kusuma, 35, as she comforted her fever-prone baby boy in a discharge center in the city of Palu.
" Every minute, the doctor takes the body.
There is not enough clean water".
People were seen returning to their broken homes and searching for their wet stuff wherever they could find it.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck hundreds of people, and hospitals were overloaded.
In the Ami in Palu Hospital, where the earthquake's intensity was still felt, some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, were lying on the back.
His heart broke with tears as he explained how the earthquake shook the fifth room of the hotel where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for all of us to save ourselves.
According to Harris, who said that his family was at the wedding, "I may have been knocked down by the body of the wall.
"I heard my wife cry for help and support, so she didn't shut up".
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they are healthy".
The US embassy accuses China of using promotional media to intimidate people
The U.S. embassy in China accused Beijing of using the U.S. newspaper to broadcast the news a week after a Chinese document reported a four-page daily U.S. news release promoting the success of trade between the two countries.
U.S. President Donald Trump reported China Daily's pay rise in the Des Moines Register on Wednesday after China was accused of trying to influence the November 6 U.S. election, a charge China strongly denied.
As U.S. officials told Reuters, Trump's claim that Beijing is trying to influence the U.S. election marks a new chapter in Washington's growing campaign to put pressure on China.
Although foreign governments tend to advertise to stimulate trade, Beijing and Washington are currently experiencing a trade warming that has seen their prices on each other's products rise.
Chinese-Americans say that China's first trade deal was intended to target retailers in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
Former Iowa governor and current U.S. ambassador to China Terry Branstad said Beijing had been harming American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, according to Branstad, "has now reduced that violence by promoting false advertising on our own free press", he said in a statement released Sunday in the Des Moines Register".
"The Chinese government is using a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register to promote its propaganda, taking full advantage of the cherished American traditions of free speech and free printing", says Branstad.
"Apart from that, since the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, you also don't get much of a protest voice or a real picture of the Chinese people's divergence of opinion about China's economic downturn on the newsstand, street here in Beijing", he wrote.
Without specifying which newspaper, he said, "one of China's most popular publications refused to publish" his article.
Kavanaugh's government's conflict is a common occurrence for women ahead of the upcoming election, psychologists warn
Researchers warn that they will face a challenge, especially among women, during the mid-year elections, as Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court justice, continues to support and defend numerous sexual allegations.
This has sparked strong sentiment, and many government officials have already publicly stated that they want to continue the vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Wellington, told The Hill in an article published Saturday that "these things are irreversible.
Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute request for an FBI investigation, according to Reeher, would not be enough to satisfy voters.
"Women will never forget yesterday; they will not forget tomorrow; and they will not forget November", according to Washington, D.C., magazine, Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and government director for MoveOn, said Friday.
On Friday morning, as Republicans voted to see the Judiciary Committee expand Kavanaugh's credentials despite Dr. Ford's testimony, the terrorists shouted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated on the Senate floor.
"There will be no more power and influence in this world", says the impartial Stu Rothenberg.
"The old saying is true.
However, it can be more, especially among female voters in the neighborhood and younger voters, between 18 and 29, who, although not as president, sometimes don't vote".
Investigators predicted a backlash would occur if Republicans decided to move forward with the Supreme Court's approval before Ford's public testimony to substantiate his sexual assault claims against him.
"According to NBC News, the chairman of the RNC, who was the former chairman of the RNC, said this had become a confusing issue for the GOP earlier last week.
"It's also about how the people of the State handled this and how they handled him, whether it was the committee vote, the last vote, or the long-term appointment of Kavanaugh. Guy Cecil, director of U.S. priorities, a nonprofit to help Democrats win an election, made this statement on the news program.
However, following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, Americans seem to be divided over who to believe, and the latter is more likely to be supported.
According to a recent YouGov poll, 41% of participants either believed or believed Ford's testimony, while 35% indicated they believed or believed Kavanaugh's statement.
Moreover, only 30% of respondents indicated that they believed Ford was lying during his testimony, compared with 38% who believed Kavanaugh may or may not have been.
The FBI is currently investigating the statements made by Ford and at least one other defendant, Deborah, after Flake's request, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Rules Committee that Kavanaugh had stabbed him to death while he was 17 years old.
The Supreme Court of the Commonwealth held that the Supreme Court introduced her genitalia to her at a party while they were both attending Yale University during the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web is launching a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebooks
World Wide Web founder Tim Berners-Lee has created a company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Berners-open Lee Solid's source has served as the basis for the latest technology-focused venture, Inrupt.
Solid users can choose where to store their data and who to provide information to.
Berners-Lee in a special interview with Fast Company said that the goal of Inrupt was "global governance".
"He said about the beginning, 'We have to do it now.
"This is a historic day".
The software uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data store" or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It seems that one web browser can access Spotify, Slack, Google Drive, and Microsoft Outlook at the same time.
The user chooses who can use it or what kind of information, which makes the online store unique.
The industry refers to this as "personal power through information".
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the company's goal is to bring the right resources, processes, and talent to help make opportunities available to everyone.
Currently, the business is made up of Bruce, Berners-Lee, an IBM-purchased security platform, a few in-house programmers hired to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to build their own social media platforms with the help of the resources provided on the Inrupt website.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google or implementing or not having a perfect model to eliminate all their business models overnight.
"We are not asking their consent".
Berners-Lee said that Inrupt's goal was to provide business capability and a natural framework to help protect the integrity and efficiency of the newly built Web on Solid" in a segment published on Medium on Saturday.
When Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994, he replaced the Internet.
Berners-Lee recently made a significant contribution to the debate on crime.
Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute even though he is launching Inrupt.
"I'm very confident about this era in the future of the web", Berners-Lee continued.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross minister commemorated
Among his people, he was the only Church of England priest to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier, and 100 years later he was knighted.
On September 29, 1918, during the raids on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt, the Rev. Bernard Vann was honored.
Lt Col In the raid on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918, the master of the protocol honored Bernard Vann.
Her two children unveiled a monument to a poet on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that a "beautiful sign" of the stone would be displayed exactly 100 years from his grandfather's winning sign.
On September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his army into a thick fog and under intense fire from the field and shots across the Saint-Quentin River, reports The London Gazette.
He later charged the gun line and led the line forward with the "strongest" before firing an unassisted shot and taking down three of the group.
More than a month before the war ended, on October 4, 1918, a German gunman killed Lt. Col. Vann.
"The work of the 72-year-old Michael Vann is nothing more than a humiliating experience", he says.
Moreover, after the march, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, they and his brother Dr. James Vann laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said "the support that many people will give is the courage of a real hero", adding that Michael Vann "felt very honoured to have been a part of the ceremony".
MMA fans who stayed out all night to shoot Bellator 206 instead of watching Peppa Pig
Imagine waking up all night watching Bellator 206 and a full house, but telling you that you can't watch the main event.
San Jose's card featured 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was shown live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
UK viewers were shocked when the show switched to Peppa Pig at 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to take on the challenge.
Some were not impressed by the long night of the battle.
A Twitter user called the change to child entertainment a "sort of horrible abuse".
"When asked why the 6 a.m. programming has been changed to children's programming, Dave Schwartz, senior marketing and communications director at Bellator, explained that the law requires it.
"Yes, the pig".
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, announced that they would change their schedule in the future to welcome UK viewers.
"When I thought about doing it again", Coker said, "I think we might be able to think about it".
"We can't solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time, because it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday there.
But we are making progress.
I can assure you that many of the scary texts have been changed as the system has changed.
We tried to fix it because we believed there was a specific problem
No, it was not; rather, it was an administrative matter.
I assure you that it will not happen next time.
We would limit ourselves to five fights instead of six, as usual, since we wanted to give the worshippers more than they expected, but we eventually left.
It is a dangerous situation.
Desert Island Discs: For Tom Daley, sex made him feel inferior
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up believing he was younger than everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that until high school, he didn't realize that not everyone was like me.
Speaking on Lauren Laverne-hosted Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, she said she advocated for LGBTQ rights to "give hope" to others.
She added that having a child has eased her anxiety about winning the Olympics.
The show's regular host, Kirsty Young, has been missing for several months due to illness.
Daley said she felt "less" than any other person who grew up because "the public did not accept the interest in boys and girls" when she appeared as a contestant on Laverne's first show.
"The truth that has given me the strength and the energy to succeed" is that I feel inferior and different", she says.
He said he wanted to show his "thing" so that no one would be discouraged if they found out about his sexuality.
Now a two-time Olympic bronze medalist who has become a popular LGBT personality and used her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a number of countries to abolish homosexuality.
He said he spoke to "give people hope" and expressed his gratitude for the freedom to live without consequences.
The three-time world champion admitted that the 2013 meeting of US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black "was a wake-up call" and that his love for him "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner last year despite being 20 years old She said age difference has never been a problem.
"The more you experience at a young age", he says, "the less you find someone of the same age who is the same height and weight. He went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
Robert Ray Black-Daley, the couple's son born in June, says that Daley's "total outlook" has changed.
If you asked me last year, my answer was "I should win a gold medal", he said.
There are things more important than winning an Olympic gold medal, you know.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son, whose name is the same as his father, Robert, died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father refused to accept his death, and one of the last things he asked if they had tickets to London 2012 was because he wanted to be in the front line.
I couldn't tell her, 'You're not coming here to sit in the front row, son,'" she explained.
I held his hand as he was paralyzed, and until he was exhausted and died, I knew that he could not be defeated.
Daley won bronze at the 2012 Olympics the following year.
"I realized that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, no greater feeling", she says.
It also influenced her first song choice, Proud by Heather Small, which she said she enjoyed on her way to the Olympics and was always getting the kiss.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15am BST.
Mickelson was sitting for the Ryder Cup on Saturday because of his poor health
When American Phil Mickelson plays his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, he will make a record, but he will need to improve his appearance to avoid becoming a disappointing position.
Mickelson, who is competing every two years for the 12th time, sat on the bench for four and a half Saturdays under captain Jim Furyk.
Rather than being at the center of the action, as usual for the US, the five-time champion split his day between entertainment and working on his game on the line in hopes of correcting what hurt him.
Even at his peak, the 48-year-old was not a very accurate driver, making him an unsuitable contender for Le Golf National, where the long course often punishes him.
If the course is not enough to be a mixed match, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game Nine on Sunday, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are back on the first 12 games, start early, Mickelson's game could be a big deal.
Furyk expressed her faith in her husband, but she could not say anything else.
He hit me in the back, grabbed me by the hand, and promised to be ready the next day, according to Furyk's comment.
He was very confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and the club has improved greatly over the past week and this week.
I probably never imagined him playing two games.
Although I had other ideas, that was what happened and how we felt we should go.
He shares it with everyone else who wants to be outside.
On Sunday, Mickelson will be outperforming Nick Faldo for the most Ryder Cup games played.
A Ryder Cup career that has not yet reached its individual record high could end in the end.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 draws, and seven semi-finals, but Furyk said he contributed to the team.
He said: "He is a great man in the chamber. He is a wise, wise, intelligent man, and he loves to please others.
"I believe the young players would love to pick him up this week, which was a lot of fun to watch.

European captain Thomas Bjorn realizes that a great opportunity is soon to be lost
European Ryder Cup Captain Thomas Bjorn has learned from past experience that most of the lead up to the last day of singles races could be quickly broken in a difficult race.
The Seve Ballesteros team remained fifth against the Americans in that 1997 game at Valderrama, but were barely able to cross the finish line with their noses forward at the smallest margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2 The Dane made his debut in that game.
The Class of 2018 won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to rank 10-6 at Le Golf National "You still remember yourself we had a great reputation at Valderrama; we had a great reputation at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only narrowly", Bjorn said, revealing.
History will tell me and all of that team that it's not over.
You're going to be sad tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
The meal was not finished until the sculpture was placed on the altar.
We continue to focus on trying to win this cup as our main goal.
I always keep my focus on the 12 heroes in our team, but we know the best players in the world are on the other side of the field.
Bjorn continued, impressed by the way his men had played a difficult golf course: I would never try this before I was ready.
Tomorrow will be a different beast.
The performance of each person will be a different thing to do tomorrow.
When things are going well, it is nice to be there with a mate, but when you are there alone, you are put to the test of your full potential as a golfer.
Get the best out of yourself tomorrow as the message you have to convey to the players.
You have left your partner, and he must go and get the better of himself".
Compared to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk would look for his players to perform better on their own than they did as partners, with Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas being the exception, while they received three out of four points.
Furyk was on both sides of those dramatic changes in the last days, when he defeated Brookline before falling as Europe pulled the "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember all the insults", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, gathered his team on the final day.
"While we have 12 important competitions tomorrow, you'd better start early as you did in Medinah and Brookline.
When the situation changes in one direction, much pressure is put on the center.
We arranged our line by line and sent men along the path we felt we could perform magic tomorrow".
Thomas worked his way up the ladder, and he faced Rory McIlroy in the top competition, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other Europans around the top half of the standings.
"Bjorn explained why he chose the singles lineup he made: "We went with this group of guys on this series because I think it's all the time".
The new German ship is also late
The new German Navy vessel was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the older Cold War vessels, but will not be ready until at least next year due to poor weather and snow conditions, according to national media.
According to Die Zeit newspaper a military spokesman said, the order of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the project's purpose was thwarted due to problems after delivery.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class ships.
They will reportedly be fitted with a powerful gun, various types of aircraft and launchers, and advanced technologies such as radar attenuation, infrared, and acoustic signals.
Long service life is another important characteristic; new frigates must be able to be installed for two years away from home ports.
However, the continued delay means that warships, which are said to allow Germany to use foreign energy, will no longer be valid at the time of entry into service, according to Die Zeit.
The bad F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy formally declined to order the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy has returned a ship to its construction site after it was delivered.
The reasons for the return are unknown, but German media reported a number of "programming and hardware failures" that damaged the ship when it was deployed in a battle.
The program failures were especially worrying because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates would be led by a crew of 120 sailors, which is less than half the number of sails on older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it provided a large amount of weight for the ship, which reduced performance and limited the Navy's ability to add to future repairs.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice the weight of the similar-sized submarines used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the total cost of the work, including the training of the crew, is a matter of concern.
It is estimated that it rose from the previous €2.2 billion to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
Troubles with new ships are of particular concern with the recent warning that the German navy is declining in strength.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy now "has no viable ships".
The officer said that the problem had grown worse over time as older ships were broken up and no other ships were replaced.
He lamented the fact that none of the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the personal lives of tattoo artists
A new study is being conducted in a Scottish Highland field that aims to identify the use of grazing to find food.
It is hoped that information on bird species' special behaviour will be further clarified and help guide future conservation efforts.
Research may provide new insights into rare bird behaviour and help spur conservation efforts.
At Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, researchers from the national conservation area for Scotland will observe traditional and soprano pipistrelles as well as long-eared brown and Daubenton tattoos.
To monitor the performance of tattoos throughout the season, special data will be placed in the data centers on the site.
Mobile surveys using handheld devices will also be conducted by NHS staff and volunteers.
A complete map of their behavior will be made later using a map and report.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes the findings will reveal what types of sites are most important to tattoos and how each species uses them.
These data will be used to assess the effectiveness of site management activities such as forestry and best ways to preserve trees for tattoos and other similar species.
The population of tattoos in Scotland and across the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They face threats from construction and development projects that disrupt buildings and cause loss of space.
Light bulbs, flying papers, some building chemicals, motorcycles, and pet attacks are all potential hazards.
Of course, he is not blind.
However, because of their nighttime cornering habits, they rely on their hearing rather than their sight to catch animals.
For detecting bugs and other obstacles in their flight path, they use a location-based technology.
The NTS is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic structures, 38 historic farms, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
Its ten skilled professionals often conduct searches, seal checks, and occasional emergency rescue.
At Threave House in Dumfries and Galloway, a home to eight of Scotland's ten butterfly species, the organisation even established Scotland's first and only designated butterfly reserve.
The owner, David Thompson, says that the estate is the best place for them.
"We have a big tattoo group here in Threave", he said.
"We had many old trees, ancient structures, and beautiful landscapes.
However, we still don't know much about tattoos, so research we do here and elsewhere will help us to learn more about what they need to survive.
He stressed the importance of tattoo checks before any home maintenance because the sudden demolition of a single nursing home could kill 400 women and their children, potentially wiping out the entire population.
Because they are protected, they cannot be killed by tattoos, accidents, accidents, or their homes destroyed.
The Scottish tattoo keeper Elisabeth Ferrell urges the public to help.
"We have a lot to learn about our tattoos", he says, "and we don't know how many people we have".
Ronaldo denies the rape charge as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape against him "news", saying that those who did so "want to promote themselves".
The German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges, will be prosecuted by its lawyers.
The American actress, Kathryn Mayorga, was accused by Portugal and Juventus in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he paid $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
Ronaldo, 33, called the story "false news" in an Instagram video of his 142 million followers within hours of being posted.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no, no, no, no, no, no, and no, no, no, no, no, and no, no, no, no, and no, no, no, and no, no, no, and no, no, no, and no, no, no, and no, no, and no, no, and no, no, no, and no, and no, no, and no, no, no, and no, no, and no, and no, no, and no, no, and no, no, and no, and no, and no, no, and no, no, and no, and no, no, and no, and no, no, and no, no, and no, and no, no, and no, and no, and no, no, and no, and no, no, and no, no, and no, and no, and no, and no, and no, and no.
In front of the camera, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner declared, "That's what they said in the news today.
"They want to use my name to promote themselves.
It is usually.
They want to be famous, but calling my name is part of their job.
Everything is fine and I am a happy person", the scorer continued, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to investigate the "Der Spiegel" on the allegations, which they call "an indefinable report of privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
The athlete will seek moral harassment in a quantity "equivalent to the magnitude of the violation, which appears to be one of the most significant violations of human rights in recent years", according to lawyer Christian Schertz.
The alleged incident occurred in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting in a barn, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reportedly returned to the player's room, where he had forced him to pull, according to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo knelt down and told him that "99%" of a "good guy" was dropped by "1%" after the incident.
According to the records, Ronaldo revealed that the couple had had sex, but a compromise was reached.
Mayorga also said that he reported the incident to the police and that his injuries were photographed at the hospital, but ultimately made an out-of-court decision due to his fear of retaliation and concerns about the private stigma.
The 34-year-old says that because the accident is still plaguing him, he is now trying to get the money back.
During the attack, Ronaldo will sign with Real Madrid from Manchester United This summer, Ronaldo went to Italian club Juve for a €100 million fee.
Brexit: UK "will forever mourn" the loss of drivers
According to business secretary Greg Clark, the UK "will be forever sad" if, as a result of Brexit, it loses its position as a world leader in the automotive industry.
He said Toyota UK had been "concerned" that the BBC would temporarily suspend production at its Burnaston facility, near Derby, when the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal.
"A trade-off is needed", said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese automaker says that the effect of delaying the border on a car accident can lead to a loss of jobs.
Almost 150,000 cars are produced at Toyota's plant in Burnaston each year, with 90% sold to the rest of the European Union.
"Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive at burnaston, said that he believes that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be no more factories in our factory.
Other UK cars, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how to handle cross-border trade.
For one month after Brexit, BMW, for example, plans to close its Oxford Mini factory.
Major concerns are focused on what carmakers see as the supply crisis in the event of a no-trade Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "only-time" basis, with parts for custom built cars coming from UK and EU dealerships in 37 minutes.
There may be a delay at the border if the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a trade deal, according to the industry, which could lead to delays and partial shortages.
Toyota indicated that it would be difficult to maintain the record value at its factory in Derbyshire, and that the result would be a production halt.
Theresa May's checking plans for future ties with the EU, according to Mr Clark, are "correctly structured to avoid such border checks".
"We want to make the best of this opportunity as well as enjoy the success that is now", he said on BBC radio 4's Today programme.
"Toyota and other manufacturers have also shown that we should be able to maintain the most efficient supply chain system".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the long run, the company warned that higher prices would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Union convenor at the factory, Peter Tsouvallaris, who had worked at Burnaston for 24 years, said his workers were beginning to worry: "As far as I know, these conditions never come back.
Government official statement: "We have set a clear and valid guideline for our future relationship with the EU".
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed
The White House said Sunday that the summit of Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "pushed out next week" as Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court campaign continues.
Rosenstein is responsible for the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election disruption, ties between Trump's partners and Russia, and possible presidential interference with justice.
For months, Washington has been rumoring whether Trump will remove the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller's independence.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Rosenstein was thought to be wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and that the president could be punished by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday amid accusations that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was in New York for the United Nations, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he was "not happy" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee review in which both Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual assault, Dr Christine Blasey Ford , testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of information against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's secretary, spoke to Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "There was no date set; it was probably this week, but in view of all the other Supreme Court proceedings, I saw that it was pushed back to the next week.
But we'll see, and I want to keep the journalists posted".
Some journalists may disagree with the statement: Sanders has not held a White House meeting since September 10th.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of commentary was not because he disliked the "beautiful" TV reporters, but he added: "I'm not arguing that they're grandstands".
He then suggested that Trump's direct ties with the media would increase.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any president before him", he said, without elaborating: "We looked at those numbers".
There will still be a few brief statements, Sanders said, but "if the media gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, that's more than talking to me.
We're going to try to do more, as you saw in the past few weeks, and it's going to be replaced by a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States".
When he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guests, Trump often accepts questions.
The media coverage is unusual.
This week in New York, the president may have revealed the reason, to make a free and sometimes unusual car before the press release.
Concerns over Brexit led the Secretary of Health to write to EU staff at NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health has written to the European Union staff working at Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wishes for those who remain at the post office.
Jeane Freeman MSP sends a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has previously agreed to pay the costs of EU citizens seeking permanent residency working in its public sector.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: "During the summer, Brexit talks continued between the UK and the EU, with results expected this fall.
However, the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a non-trade status.
I am sure that this will be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize my deep appreciation for all workers, regardless of nationality.
Partners from across the EU and beyond are providing professional skills and talents to the healthcare sector, which strengthens and improves its workforce and benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we want you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
According to Tennessean's Mike Organ, Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie needed emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
The injury occurred just before the storm, according to Tennessee State coach Rod Reed.
"He was the only one who fell over the line", Reed recalls.
Abercrombie obtained oxygen from teachers and doctors on the line before loading it onto a shelf and returning it for further evaluation.
Abercrombie was released from Vanderbilt Medical Center, according to a Tennessee State official who spoke to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee.
According to Harris, "there is no specific information on the type/status of injuries at this time", and the State of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second redshirt from Illinois, is in his first season with Tennessee State.
He had five hits before leaving the game on Saturday, earning a total of 18 runs.
When buying a home in the UK, foreign buyers will pay a high marginal duty
Under the new Tory plans, foreign buyers will pay higher stamp duty when buying a home in the UK, along with additional money to care for homeless people.
The move would undermine Corbyn's promise to achieve teenage votes
Increased stamp duty will apply to UK tax exempt individuals
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency expects to provide up to £120 million annually to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will face a high marginal duty when buying property in the UK, along with additional money to help homeless people, Theresa May said today.
The move would be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young people by promoting affordable and economically viable housing.
The stamp duty increase will be given to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes within the UK, along with other funding groups to support government efforts to combat insomnia.
The additional cost, which would add to the current tariffs, including the highest amounts implemented in the past two years in secondary and retail homes, could be as high as 3%.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency expects to raise up to £120 million annually.
Non-UK buyers are predicted to buy 13% of new properties in London, raising prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get on the property bench.
Because many foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad, many of the country's wealthiest areas, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns".
The new plan came weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the number of tickets to help many young people buy their first land.
He accused large construction companies of raising house prices by buying land rather than building on it, and urged Mrs May to remove the need for affordable housing so that Britain could overcome "shameful housing".
Mr Corbyn has advocated a number of housing policies, including restricting listings and ending "no mistakes".
He also wants to give councils more authority to build new buildings.
"Last year", says Mrs May, "I said I would give my prime to reviving the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
This meant repairing our damaged housing markets.
The UK continues to welcome those who wish to live, work and make a living in the country.
However, it cannot be accepted that individuals who are not UK residents, as well as foreign-based entities, can buy property like UK hardworking people.
The quality of homeownership has grown tremendously for many people, and the difficulty of sleeping remains a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to rule Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "greatest dream" was to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is looking forward to the challenge of restoring the North-East club, which is third in the Premier League, three-eaters from the top flight.
After taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season, he went on the field of play this summer.
"I wanted to be a national player.
"I got a B-hat and that was it", Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father and it brought me back.
That opportunity, however, will be available if I succeed in club management".
Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paul Di Canio were all managers of Sunderland before Ross.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he had no worries about following solid names at a major club, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For now, my success will be measured by the question, 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This team is definitely going to join the Premier League due to its architecture and structure", he said.
"It was not an easy task to get there, but I would think of myself as a success if I could bring the club back".
Ross, who has been manager for just three years, was previously deputy manager at Dumbarton and a member of the Hearts coaching staff for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division, replacing St Mirren from the back-to-back championship sides the following season.
And Ross says he feels more relaxed today than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton training.
"Pushing Alloa is definitely a real crossroads", he says.
"I really believed that controlling a game was better for me than playing.
I seem to be different because I was good, lived a life of dignity, and had high standards of happiness.
However, playing may be difficult.
You have a lot of work to do each week.
I still face the demands and pressures of work, but the management seems to be right.
I always wanted to be in control, and now I have done the easiest thing I have ever felt in my own skin in my entire adult life".
The full interview will be available on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30 at 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Radio Scotland
Saturday at 5.30 pm is the best time for a pint, according to a poll
The warm summer has increased profits for UK hospitals but increased pressure on commercial restaurants.
Sales for shopping malls and bar groups were up 2.7% in July, while restaurant sales declined to 4.8%, according to data.
According to the statistician, Peter Martin, CGA business consultant: "The result of continued sunshine and/or England's long-term goal of participating in the World Cup, the July economic situation was similar to that of June, when retail sales rose by 2.8%; however, restaurants were very bad.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant purchases in June was worse in July.
The shops and bars leading to the drinks were better, and the likes of pleasure were more numerous than restaurants.
Food stores were also exposed to the sun, although not as badly as restaurants.
Apparently, the people just wanted to go out and drink.
Sales of beverages and bargains rose by 6.6% month-on-month, while sales of food fell by 3%.
"These studies support the trend we have seen since the end of April", said Paul Newman, a researcher at RSM's tourism and hospitality department.
When it comes to out-of-home purchases, the cost and impact of professional organizations or sports continues to be the most important factor.
It is not surprising that restaurant sectors are still struggling, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales year-on-year would be most painful on a continuing price trend.
The long and hot summer could not come at a worst time for the food industry, and it is only a matter of time before we know whether the cool temperatures we saw in August will provide much-needed relief".
In July, the total number of shopping mall and restaurant transactions, including open spaces, was 2.7%, reflecting a slowdown in the trend.

One in five children hide their parents from their social media pages
According to a survey, one in five children, some under 11, have social information they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in "Instagram fake" pages
Fear of the evil that is being spread is heightened by news
20% of students said they had a "first" story they reveal to their parents
One in five children, some of whom are as young as 11, are organizing private social media campaigns.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that the number of "fake Insta" accounts, which relate to the photo-sharing website, has increased rapidly.
News has raised fears of spreading sexual content.
Twenty percent of students confirmed having confidential information and a clean "first" information they use to reveal their parents.
A mother found a boy who encouraged others to "rape me" after he posted a message on her 13-year-old daughter's website".
The HMC meeting of independent schools and Digital Awareness UK conducted the survey, which revealed that 40% of 11 to 18 year olds had two accounts, while half of those said they kept private accounts.
HMC executive Mike Buchanan says: "It is alarming that many teenagers are drawn to online identity theories that their parents or teachers cannot find".
Eilidh Doyle will represent the players on the Scottish Athletics committee as their "voice"
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilidh Doyle was appointed as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics committee.
The change will allow those who control the sport to benefit from Doyle's experience in the world over the past decade He is Scotland's most accomplished sports and sporting figure skater Chairman Ian Beattie called the move a great opportunity.
"Eilidh is highly respected by the Scottish, UK, and international athletics associations, and we are confident that joining the board of directors will be of great benefit to sports in Scotland", added Beattie.
"I want to speak for the athletes, and I really hope I can help shape Scottish sport", Doyle says.
The American, who has four Olympic gold medals in total and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after suffering a temporary ischemic attack He won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta.
He wrote on Twitter: I had a stroke last month.
I could not walk.
Only when I know, according to doctors, how much I will recover.
Despite the difficulty of recovery, I was able to learn to walk again and now I am participating in strength training!
Thank you for the support messages!
Internet debate has been sparked by advertisements for breastfeeding comparing mothers to cows
An ad for a breastfeeding company that compares nursing mothers to breastfeeding cows has sparked controversy online.
The digital marketing campaign by Elvie focused on a music-themed auction to promote the arrival of what is called the "world's first irrigation farm" and highlight the flexibility of the new pump offered to the exhibiting women.
Four real mothers dance to a song like these words in a cattle barn full of drought: "Yes, I breastfeed, but you don't see the tail" and "Until you notice it, it's not milk, it's my milk".
And he answered and said, Pump out, pump out; I am feeding infants, and I am nursing my daughters.
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
The film received a mixed response from the audience, with 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments; some say it underestimates the "terror" of the dairy industry.
"It's a bad idea to put cows in the advertising of this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to breastfeed, but unlike us, their babies are taken from them before they are born", writes one person.
A skin care unit can cover the Elvie milk pump (Elvie/Tina)
Another said: "The stress is obvious for both mother and child.
However, rather than being used to promote a breast pump for mothers who can care for their children, why not?
"It's an old advertisement", added one.
Others blocked the advertisements, and one woman said that she thought the music was "fun".
"I think that's a wise idea.
I would have found one if I had kept going.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
Although advertising was a crazy touch, I used it at the price of the product.
This is so exciting", wrote one person.
Another commented: "This humorous ad is about mothers who pump and feel like "cows" (usually in bathrooms or public places).
This is not a promotion that honors or condemns the breast sector.
The women of the group all admit that they were dancing while wearing secret pumps that were placed inside their clothes at the end of the film.
The idea behind the ad was inspired by the observation that many breastfeeding mothers claim to be cattle.
The Elvie Pump is unusual in that it is very quiet, has no wires or tubes, and is hidden in a care crate, allowing mothers to walk freely, hold their babies, and leave the house while pumping.
ECD partner Ana Balarin told Mother: "The Elvie Pump should have a very controversial and controversial introduction because it is a dirty product.
We wanted to clarify the milk pump and all its problems while showing the great sense of freedom that the new pump would bring in a fun and approachable way To do this, we make a comparison between the display of females and cows.
Elvie's pump was the first to make headlines.
A mother of two used this as she walked down the aisle for the Marta Jakubowski award at London Fashion Week.
On the Texas border, hundreds of migrant children were secretly moved into a tent
While the monthly border crossing remains stable, the number of migrant children detained has increased, in part because Donald Trump's heavy word control and actions have made it more difficult to place children and supporters.
Historically, many self-supporting immigrants have refused to step forward to adopt a child because of concerns about their own ability to stay in the country.
When federal officials indicated that potential sponsors and other adults living in their homes would be required to submit fingerprints and that information would be shared with travel authorities, the threat arose in June.
Senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albence testified before Congress last week that many of the adults detained by the agency had filed applications to support missing children.
The organization later determined that 70% of individuals detained had no prior history.
Nearly 80% of the country's illegal residents are sponsors or family members of sponsors, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we are still looking for those people, says Mr. Albence.
Refuge workers say new guidelines have been put in place by leaders in an effort to speed up child processing requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, aside from the initial 60-day requirement.
Many people will talk with an immigration judge over a video conference call rather than in person to argue for their legal status.
Those who do not qualify for help will fall back quickly.
According to shelter officials and recent reports, the longer the children are in prison, the more likely they are to experience stress or depression, which can lead to chaos and attempted escape.
A large house like Tornillo, which is more likely to ignore details of a child's problems because of its size, is therefore the most serious of these concerns, according to advocates.
Children moving to the tent city without enough time to prepare themselves for emotions or to part ways with friends can increase the stress facing many people, they noted.
Syria orders immediate withdrawal of "power" from the US, France, and Turkey
Although the conflict in Syria has been going on for eight years, foreign minister Walid al-Moualem urged the refugees to return home in his speech to the UN General Assembly.
Foreign forces were illegally present in Syria as counterterrorists, according to Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, and will be treated well.
Then he urged the crowd to leave without warning.
Despite the fact that more than 360,000 people have died in Syria since 2011 and millions more have fled their homes, Moualem said the country's war on terror is almost over.
He promised that Damascus would keep "this holy war" until "we clear all Syrian territory" of terrorist organizations and "any foreigners".
About 2,000 American troops are stationed in Syria, mostly training and advising Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad as well as the Kurdish people.
France has more than 1,000 ground forces in the country's war zones.
Regarding the refugee crisis, Moualem argued that the conditions were favorable for their return and condemned "other western countries" as "reporting false concerns" that caused the refugees to settle abroad.
The global community and charities are encouraged to help these returnees, he said.
What should be a loving issue of politics.
Syria will not receive reconstruction aid unless Assad and the opposition reach a political solution to the conflict, the United States and the European Union warn.
UN missionaries say there is now room for political negotiations ahead of a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a barrier zone in Idlib, the last rebel war.
The Russian-Turkish agreement halted a major Russian-backed Syrian offensive on the province, which has a population of three million.
However, Moualem stressed that the trade "lightens the timeline" and reflects the hope that jihadists, including members of the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, will be "destroyed" as a result of the military.
A new committee of government and pro-democracy members is expected to begin the summit soon to build a dispute base for Syria and pave the way for elections, UN representative Staffan de Mistura said.
The committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the terms of the existing framework", said Moualem, who also warned of the crisis.
What will Trump win a second term?
For that reason, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, according to many leftists, impeachment and defamation are inevitably the beginning of his term.
It is certainly "the most remarkable decision of any president!"

Foreign money poured into the House's midterm elections
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is seeing a cash flood, thanks to congressional district reorganization that put two candidates in the race for the same seat.
This new district is rewritten in the city of Pittsburg with two Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb and a Republican winning a special election in another district this past spring.
Lamb is facing another politician, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents Pennsylvania's old 12th congressional district, which is roughly equivalent to the new 17th.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were not in line with the gerrymandered constitution for Republicans, maps were restored.
The new 17th Congressional District race has sparked financial turmoil between the major party financial groups, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) (NRCC).
The Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by the Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the top 20.
Political analysts believe Democrats have a small chance.
U.S. Sentenced El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Repeated
Diplomats noted that Beijing had already been recognized by the Dominican Republic and Panama, and Washington had little opposition.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization's executive branch.
The State Department decided to recall U.S. diplomatic leaders in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of "the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, in a statement released earlier this month.
However, sanctions were limited to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including coal management, development, and economic aid.
Legislative sanctions, including cutting financial aid and visa restrictions, would have severely damaged the Central American country, which has high unemployment and high murder rates.
As the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American countries postponed a summit on security and economic development, which was scheduled to follow a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from traveling to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior officials had made it clear they wanted the meeting to continue, and completed the termination of any sanctions assessments for El Salvador.
According to theologians, Vice President Mike Pence will address the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, to highlight the importance of the administration of the event.
After receiving no further severe instructions or sanctions from Washington, three American ambassadors for El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic were wisely released.
Three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to share internal conversations on the issue of identity, including a White House representative for Mr. Bolton, declined to comment on the specific details of the conversation.
A foreign expert close to the government and who also spoke on the anonymity platform confirmed their claims.
Studying the History
Special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's ability to obstruct justice, which has long been the subject of significant public record-keeping, may be the next step.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller is now focusing on whether Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia is coordinated in relation to our elections.
Trump will respond to Congress when he changes hands, just as he is prepared to confront the voters again and perhaps even a jury of his peers.
It's only if, and I'm not saying Mr. Trump's death or what his Europeans are certain.
We all need to make decisions to determine how long the campaign may last on both sides of the Atlantic.
Had the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich in 1938, German police would have launched an attack on Hitler.
We failed and lost the opportunity to stop the devastation that followed.
Such changes have affected the course of history and have affected the rapid or slow progress of democracy.
The United States is now undergoing many of these changes.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who is responsible for Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Since this newspaper revealed that Rosenstein had conceived of secretly arresting the president last year and making complaints about his ineptitude, Rosenstein was in the middle of a hot water.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
"How would we respond if the recent investigation of Brett Kavanaugh O.B.I. was incomplete or inappropriate, or if he was proven in the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
But more importantly, will we hold our midterm elections to elect a Congress that will prosecute Mr. Trump?
The democratic system will face a long winter if we fail to pass those tests.
But I am confident that we will succeed because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
It was during the Nazi occupation that my embassy was confiscated and my mother, a Czechoslovak Jew, was sent to Auschwitz.
When I was sent to light a Sabbath candle on that table with a swastika 60 years ago, he survived, traveled to America, and is still alive.
With that in mind, how can I feel insecure about the future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers feels optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna's match
Rangers Rapid Vienna play on Thursday, with the knowledge that a win over the Austrians will put them in a better position to qualify from the Europa League's Group G, after a great performance in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
Graham Dorrans did not make his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 defeat against Villarreal due to a knee injury, but he feels the Rangers can use that decision as a source for more.
"It's an exciting situation for us since Villarreal is a good team", says the 31-year-old.
"We went to the game hoping to win and end up with a win.
We may have scored at the end, but a tie is certainly a good result.
They were certainly more than halfway through the first half, but we were stronger in the second half.
Thursday brings another important European night.
While it will be difficult to have a successful result in their last game, I believe we can move forward and win the audience's support.
Amid all the events surrounding my injuries and changes at the club, last year was undeniably difficult, but today's environment is improving.
The sound is good, and the children rejoice; and the instruction is excellent.
We hope to pass the last season and move forward successfully".
Women worry about their retirement and can't sleep
Those who participated in the study had a clear sense of how they wanted to be treated, but few talked to their family members.
In a Nationwide survey, about half of respondents reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had discussed it with their children.
"People want a family to take care of them", says Holly Snyder, vice president of the national health insurance group, "but they're not the first to talk.
Let's start here.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not tell your family what you need, they will not be able to plan to care for you.
Discuss where and how to get treatment with your counselor and family, as these decisions can have a significant impact on the cost.
Get your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for your expenses.
Long-term care insurance, financial insurance to help pay for these expenses, or self-funding, are all options for long-term care, if you have the money.
Build your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at all costs.
Create a health care representative who will appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical treatment and ensure that experts follow your needs when you cannot communicate.
Consider also a legal force.
If you are imperfect, you can hire a trusted financial advisor to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your money is paid.
Remember these small details: Suppose you have an emergency and are on your way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Make a written plan and detailed information to prepare for it.
"It's not just the financial situation that's at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have a plan".
In Ilfracombe, a man shot several times with an air gun

Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
Officials say the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday killed at least 384 people, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Aid workers have been unable to obtain information from Donggala province, which is located north of Palu and near the center of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people left Palu.
Here are some interesting facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, and has a population of 379,800 as of 2017 estimates.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a province in northwestern Sulawesi that extends over 300 kilometres (180 mi) of coastline.
In 2017, the district, which is administered under a county, had a population of 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in Donggala province.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, although it is mostly centered in Morowali, across the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Emergency Department, Palu and Donggala have been hit by flooding several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a landslide devastated the western part of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Ring of Fire strong and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
These are just some of the recent earthquakes and floods:
2004: A major earthquake struck the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 and caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing flooding in the south, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed many villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A white earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing unrest and anxiety as the locals commemorate the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
While there was no flooding at this time, more than 100 people died in the collapses.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and trapped thousands of visitors.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, former Alaska governor and vice president of Sarah Palin's oldest son, is imprisoned on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, defrauding a domestic violence suspect, and protesting the capture, according to a report by Alaska State Troopers released Saturday.
When a regular woman tried to call the police to identify the crimes she was committing, she picked up her phone, according to a police report.
Palin is still being held in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility on $500 bail pending court approval as KTUU has said.
When asked to say yes, he declared himself "not guilty, certainly not guilty", according to the website.
Palin is charged with three counts of Class A misdemeanor, which could result in a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also convicted of a class B felony, which carries a one-day suspended sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has faced criminal charges.
He was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin, in December 2017.
Sarah Palin, his mother, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The Alaska Supreme Court is currently hearing the case.
He was released in January 2016 on charges of domestic violence, interference with the reporting of a domestic crime, and possession of a weapon while under arrest.
His girlfriend says he's got his faces cut out.
Veterans groups punished Sarah Palin in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD caused by her service in Iraq.
The tsunami hit Indonesia, killing hundreds
On Friday, an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, killing at least 384 people.
A tsunami caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications are cut off, and the death toll will rise in the coming days.
The quake struck off the coast of central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia.
Video of the time effects are spreading on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in Palu after the storm hit.
Attorneys seek a death sentence for a suspect in the NYC terror attack
New York state attorneys are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people  as an unusual punishment for a federal crime not committed in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of carrying out an assault on a bicycle lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan using a rented Home Depot truck, and displacing pedestrians and cyclists along his path in October.
State lawyers must confirm that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm in support of a death sentence, according to the statement of intent to seek the extreme penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both of these crimes could be punishable by death.
The panel has filed 22 charges against federal prosecutor Saipov, including eight counts of premeditated murder, which are often used by prosecutors in criminal cases, and assault and motor vehicle damage.
State lawyers said the attack required "considerable and premature preparation", and that Saipov carried out it "in a cruel, violent, and vicious manner".
"The statement of intent states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused the injury, injury, and loss of family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of those killed were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York has not had a death sentence in nearly a decade.
Khalid Barnes, the defendant, was convicted of the murders of two drug dealers but sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last used in a federal case in New York in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenbergs were all executed in the electric chair.
According to court records, Saipov, an Uzbek national, expressed a little bit of grief in the days and months following the attack.
According to authorities, he told investigators that he was happy with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the officials that he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS images on his phone.
According to authorities, he also requested the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
In response to 22 charges, he pleaded not guilty.
Saipov's federal prosecutor, David Patton, said they were "clearly unhappy" with the police department's decision.
"We believe that choosing the death penalty rather than admitting guilt and receiving a life sentence without a vote will further hurt all future victims", Patton said.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team had asked lawyers not to pursue the death penalty.
Tory MP believes NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to be responsible for Brexit negotiations
During a protest at the Tory rally today, Nigel Farage vowed to "activate the people's army.
As one of Theresa May's MPs said she should be responsible for negotiations with the EU, the former Ukip leader said the politicians should "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics.
Peter Bone, the Conservative MP at the Birmingham march, said if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary, the UK would have been out by now.
However, the difficulty facing Mrs May in recovering her divided positions has been highlighted by the Pro-Remain Tories taking part in a second anti-Brexit rally in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to secure his Checkers' flexible strategy on the road by dealing with criticism from Brexiteers, Remainers, and the EU.
Despite criticism, allies will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his strategy and 'hot'.
Mr Bone said at the time that leaving the events in Solihull meant he wanted to "score checkers".
He proposed to appoint Mr Farage as a partner and assigned responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been king, we would have gone now, " they replied.
The Wellingborough mayor added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must score", Checkers.'
He expressed his opposition to the EU: 'We have not fought world wars to serve others.
In our own country, we want to make our own laws.'
Mr Bone rejected statements that public sentiment had changed after the 2016 election: 'The statement that the British people have changed their minds and are better off living in the UK is completely wrong.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who was also at the march, told the media: 'So I say: Prime Minister, make public comments.
"The pride of the Czech nation is displeasing, the Axis is not supportive, and our political party and militants are displeased that they are so hard on the road and put us in the first place", one of our party members said.
Put the Checkers down and start listening, please.'
He added in a direct message to Mrs May: 'The Prime Minister remains in power as long as they keep their promises.'
The politicians should make themselves "feel hot", Mr Farage said at the meeting, if they are going to violate the election results from 2016.
"This is the question of trust between us, the people, and our rulers.
'They are trying to ruin Brexit, and we are here to tell them we will not let them escape.'
He added this to a message to the enthusiastic crowd: 'I want to put the heat on our political state, which is on the verge of Brexit betrayal.
'We are rallying the people's army of this country, which has won Brexit, and we will not rest until we have an independent, self-governing, and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the supporters continued to march through Birmingham before gathering for two hours in the city centre.
After the group's launch over the weekend, a small group of protesters bought out against Brexit flags.
As the convention began, Labour colleague Lord Adonis criticized the conservatives for security concerns in a party app.
'These are the people who are telling us that they can get both the technology and the technology in places for additional Canada, for a conflict-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he continued.
It is a complete disgrace.
There will be nothing to call a good Brexit, he concluded.
Warren is expected to suggest that running for president is a "serious vision"
U.S. After the November election, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "keep the ball rolling to run for president".
The Massachusetts Democrat reportedly discussed his future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday, according to the Boston Globe.
Warren is running for re-election in November against GOP State Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He was the subject of a potential Trump challenge in 2020.
His meeting with voters in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon marked the 36th anniversary of Trump's inauguration.
A member asked him if he intended to run for president.
"Women need to travel to Washington to replace our fractured nation, and that includes a top woman", Warren responded.
The shooting of Sims at LSU led to capture
One suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday is still in custody, according to police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
At 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department issued an announcement about the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20. ET news conference.
On Friday, they filmed a video of the shooting and asked for help identifying a man who had been seen inside.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near the Southern University campus.
Wayde Sims was shot in the head and killed", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, according to 247sports.
When Wayde was trying to protect her friend, Simpson shot her.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being present, to having a weapon, and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department after being detained without incident.
Sims, a 6-foot-6, Baton Rouge, native, played in 32 games and started 10 last year, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: After the team's instructions, Lewis Hamilton defeated Sebastian Vettel to close out the world championship
Valtteri Bottas' victory over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday in qualifying indicated that the direction of the Mercedes team would have a major impact on the race.
From pole position, Bottas got off to a strong start and nearly left Hamilton hanging after his position in the first two rounds had been successful, opening the door for Vettel to attack his team.
Hamilton was left running in the car at the back of the box as Vettel entered the hole, which was supposed to be the selection section.
After a long wheel-to-wheel battle that left Ferrari's driver reluctant to leave the car inside in a danger of stopping to follow a two-wheeled defensive trailer in the third corner, Hamilton took control of Vettel and the family member, who had made a second start.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back of the line and finished ninth in the starting line-up.
And while he stuck to his tires in an effort to finish the race early and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth, he led the most laps.
On the 44th leg, he eventually entered two, but he could not pick up the pace on the next eight legs, and Raikkonen passed him for the fourth.
A challenge today is that Valtteri, who had done a fine job over the weekend and was a real man, asked him to let me drive.
To get a one-two, the team is very excited, Hamilton notes.
A Big Bad Body Language
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump was smoking at Senator Dianne Feinstein for insisting that she had not handed over the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president did not specifically mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee while speaking at a meeting in West Virginia Instead, he said Senate procedures showed that many were "unfair, reasonable, and dishonest".
When you see anger, when you see people who are angry and violent and dishonest, he added, "it's the same thing that could happen with the wonderful thing that happened a few days ago in the Senate".
"When you see a ring or a healing device, someone says, 'Oh, I did not do it!
It's not me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember his reply: "Oh, what, did you just scrub the paper?
Oh, no, not at all.
I did not play".
Well, wait a minute.
In his positive feelings about the senator, he said, Did we league...No, we didn't league.
The document describing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was handed over to Feinstein in July, and was first released in September However, Feinstein denied that his staff was responsible for the league.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's story, as he claims in his accusations", Feinstein told the committee, according to Hill.
"He urged me to stop, and I did".
His denial, apparently not in keeping with the president, who said during the convention Saturday night: "You know, that's a very nasty body language.
Even if he did not, it was the most abhorrent body language I have ever witnessed.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three young men, by claiming that the Democrats were using the law to sue.
"They are committed to using any means necessary to regain power.
The Medite President said that "You see the cruelty, the cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they must run to to get power and authority".

To ensure that hundreds of people on board the plane escape the earthquake, an air traffic controller is removed
An Indonesian air traffic controller lost his life and was confident that a plane that carried hundreds of people safely was being hailed as a hero.
On Friday, a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and caused a tsunami, killing more than 800 people and missing dozens.
Many people in the city of Palu are falling to the rubble because of the strong earthquake that is still there.
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, remained in the job at the formidable tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Palu airport despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives.
He stayed put to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
Believing that the control tower would collapse, he jumped out.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News in Australia.
From Balikpapan, Kalimantan, we arranged for a car to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard this", she added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that thousands of people will die, with the emergency services reportedly restricting access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
"There is a growing belief that many bodies are still buried under the rubble and many are unable to reach it", said Sutopo Bureau spokesman Purwo Nugroho.
Palu, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday, was hit by waves up to six metres high.
Military and civilian aircraft are providing supplies and assistance.
"The hospital car brings bodies every minute", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother to Sky News.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are plundering everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, representative of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is pressing to help the rest, but we don't know what they will get".
It is a problem, but it can only make matters worse".
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and told the country's military: I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the work related to the evacuation.

Micronesia plane crash: After the plane crashed into the bay, Air Niugini now reports one pilot missing
After 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft after it crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, one airline has now identified the missing person.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it was not about a passenger pilot.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond promptly to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the passengers and crew who were left behind when the plane crashed while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Seven people were taken to the hospital, officials said Friday.
Six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, according to the airline, and are all in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane crashed into the sewers rather than the sewers.
According to some witnesses, the plane overflowed the road.
American passenger Bill Jaynes indicated that the plane landed low.
"It was a very exciting experience", says Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and a few others were able to walk through the water column to get out of the sinking plane.
He said the crew had resisted and shouted, and that his head was too small.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the crew working nearby on a port upgrade helped the rescue by using a shuttle to take people ashore before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past twenty years, but no one has been affected by Air Niugini.
A researcher describes the night a woman was burned alive
The police department has relaxed after re-introducing a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department investigator Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence research.
He explained before the jury how cell phone records were used to link the actions of the accused, Quinton Tellis, 29, with the victim Jessica Chambers, 19, the night he died.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said she received records from several cell phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contrary to her previous claims.
When records revealed that Chambers was with her cell phone at the time she said she was with her friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to her.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When asked by state attorneys about Tellis' claim that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another disruption was Tellis's disclosure that he knew Chambers for two weeks before he died.
They only get to know each other once a week, according to cell phone records.
Tellis, according to Rowlett, deleted Chambers' texts, phone calls, and contact information from his phone after his death.
"He took her out of his life", says Hale.
The final debate of the opposition will begin on Sunday.
The judge indicated that he hoped the editors would hear the case later that day.
The high-end: What is hip hop light?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative perception of the genre by incorporating positive messages into their music.
According to Bristol's The High Breed, hip hop has moved away from its political and social origins.
They want to go back to its roots and reintroduce hip hop.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common have seen a recent return to Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
Nanny sued the couple in NY after they were fired for "racist" text
After receiving a false message from her mother that she was "another black person", a New York woman sued a couple for racism.
The couple rejected prejudice and compared the suit to "robbery".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was surprised to learn that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"HERE! A MAN is a MAN", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after discovering her mistake, a "disgusting" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying that their estranged wife, an African-American, had done something wrong and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then ordered to take an Uber home.
Maurice is now charging the couple with misappropriation, seeking a $350 daily reward for six months, previously employed, seat-playing, despite no contract.
"I wanted to show them, look, you don't do that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's racism".
The couple rejected the prejudice, saying that terminating Maurice was the only reasonable course of action because they could not trust him when he hurt him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't think she would say.
It is not racial.
"We are not racist", states husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But will you deliver your children to a man whom you have not respected, even a fool?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now".
Plasco compared crying to "abusing", saying that her husband is in a "difficult situation" and just two months after giving birth".
"Would you pursue such a man?"
It's not very good for you to do that, the bank adds.
While the legal case remains pending, the couple has been acquitted on social media from a public trial for their actions and lack of reason.
Paddington writers were concerned that readers could not communicate with a talking bear, according to a recent book
"It's very hard to think about reading something for the first time before it's published", said Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter born after the book was approved.
Knowing what we are doing now about Paddington's great success is so much fun.
He added that his father, who worked as a BBC photographer before being inspired to write the children's book by a little toy bear, would have been happy if he had turned down the job, and that the 60th anniversary edition of the book was "right" when he died a year ago.
He said that Paddington was "a very important member of our family" and that his father secretly enjoyed his greatest success.
He described him as "a man of peace, not a man of pride".
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child achieving something: you're proud of them even if you didn't.
I think he had a similar view of Paddington's popularity.
She often gave praise to Paddington himself, despite the fact that she was pregnant and had thoughts.
My daughter was dying, and I had to resign by phone
Her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice after landing, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad always called to say it was too bad, it couldn't", says Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Nad then called to tell me that she would die in two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
Her heartbeat-relieving medications gradually disappeared and left her body.
He died a few years earlier, and now all is closed.
I had no choice but to sit and wait and see what had happened.
Because I was surrounded by family and people, I could not cry, cry, or cry.
I had to stick with it".
Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, who ended up on the plane with other passengers, is deeply ignorant of the reality of her ordeal.
"No one knew", she said.
"I was crying all the time and bowing my head.
It is hard to describe, but during the flight, I felt a strong sense of compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I felt his deep love for her".
Mourners send suicide suicide cards on a bridge
Two women who have suffered the death of a loved one by suicide struggle to stop others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys sent out cards with incentive messages and phone numbers for people to call for help on a Welsh bridge.
Tyler Davis, the son of Ms. Davis, began to suffer from depression at age 13 and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want my parents to feel like me every day", she explains.
Ms Davis, 45, Lydney, described her son as a good cook with a dirty smile.
"Everyone recognized him for his smile.
Her smile, they said, lights up any room".
However, before his death, he stopped working because he was "in a dark place".
In 2014, an 11-year-old brother named Tyler was found dead after his brother committed suicide.
"I always worry that there will be a thorn in the side of the experience", says Ms. Davis.
Ms Davis designed the cards "to let people know that there are outsiders you can go to and talk to, even as a friend".
Don't be silent - you have to talk".
Ms Humphreys, who had been friends for a long time with Ms Davies, lost her 15-year-old boyfriend, Mark, after the death of her mother.
"She didn't say anything about grief or sadness or anything", she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his personality.
On Christmas Day, she was in her lowest position and avoided seeing children unlock their gifts.
Although his death caused them great grief, he said, they must go through: "A hole is being drilled in the family".
It tears us apart.
But we must continue to fight.

As the FBI unveils its investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future is in doubt
"I thought, if we could really achieve something like what he was asking for - a time-limited, publicly limited survey - we might bring a little unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, expressing concern that the committee was "falling" because of the crisis.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not seek an FBI investigation?
Their refusal was a result of time.
The midterm election is just five weeks away, on November 6; if Republicans fail, as expected, they will become very weak in their efforts to elect the person they want to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called on the Senate to urge them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happens after the FBI investigations?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh will win at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break a bond and prove him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean numbers "fall" under Kim
According to one South Korean official, the number of North Koreans in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug said data from the southern union department shows 1,127 violations last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said strengthening the border between North Korea and China was a key factor, as well as the high prices charged by traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
Many North Korean refugees eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is more easily crossed than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) guarded between the two Koreas.
The Chinese consider those who have turned away to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often deport them.
Relations between the North and South, which are still at war, have improved in recent months.
The leaders of the two countries met earlier this month in Pyongyang for talks focused on the failure of denuclearization negotiations.
This followed the June landmark meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, where they publicly agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US sanctions of not making any progress since then on Saturday.
"There would be no confidence in our national security if there was no reliance on the US, and under such circumstances, there is no way we would destroy ourselves first", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi described Brett Kavanaugh as a "traveller", saying he was ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "uncertain" and said she was unfit to serve on the Court.
Pelosi made the speech during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't help but wonder if a woman did that, they say 'unconvincing,'" Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was so moved, he almost cried and cried as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also directly criticized the committee's Democrats, calling the lawsuits against him a "horrible and unbridled murder" orchestrated by leftists who were unhappy with Hillary Clinton's run in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony exposed his prejudice against Democrats and therefore prevented him from serving on the Supreme Court.
"I don't think he deserves those words and the way he followed the Clintons and democrats", he says.
Pelosi declined to say whether she would try to punish Kavanaugh if he was allowed and the Democrats won control of the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this: if he doesn't speak directly to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's in now.
Kavanaugh is now a judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also expressed a fear of a Democrat over Kavanaugh's special court case against low-income care or Roe v. Wade, which is seen as a credible judge.
Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse Supreme Court special cases during his trials.
"It's not the time for an angry and prejudiced person to stand up in court and tell us to shout, 'Isn't that beautiful?'", said Pelosi.
And Women should use it.
A righteous cry, months and years of anger have broken out, and he cannot go away without weeping.
"When we are angry, we cry. 45 years later, Ms. Steinem told me.
"It seems unfamiliar to me, does it not?"
A former supervisor helped me a lot by saying that she cried when she was angry, but she took a way to tell the person she spoke to when she was angry and started crying, "I think I may be sorry I cried honey", she added.
I'm upset".
He continued on after that.
And I thought it was a wonderful experience".
Because of their lack of basic knowledge, tears are accepted as a way to express anger.
One of my clearest memories was of an older woman, a cold boss I used to fear, pushing my neck and dragging me up a ladder to a former job in a male-dominated workshop, once I cried out in a rage.
"Never let them witness your tears", she told me.
"They do not know your anger.
They believe that you are depressed and that you will be happy that they have reached out to you".
Gary Hart and Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat in Congress at the time, worked together in his presidential campaign.
So disappointed in 1987 when Mr. Hart was disqualified from the race after finding out that his wedding was taking place on a ship called Monkey Business, Ms. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president.
"She smiled and said to me, 'It's not a well thought out decision, 30 years later.
"The last thing they needed was another candidate, and seven more candidates.
Someone said "the snow white and the seven companions".
He was late for the fundraiser because the race was late, and he vowed not to run until he had won $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
He found that some of his supporters offered men $1,000 for only $250.
"Do they think I have a skin?" he asked.
He was moved by emotions as he spoke out about his no longer running for office, including gratitude for people, dissatisfaction with the system that has made it so challenging to raise money and pursue voters rather than members, and a crying resentment of gender.
"As to how the media reported her, Ms. Schroeder recalled, "You would have thought I was insane.
"Kleenex would have been wrong for my support business.
I remember well wondering what will be said on my tombstone?
"She was crying a little bit"?""
How US-China trade will benefit Beijing
While the U.S.-China trade relationship is far from over, researchers say Beijing may benefit in the long run from a split between the two powers, the first salvos were loud.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on Chinese valuable goods, such as solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The biggest increase this week came with new tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, which are taxing half of China's imports into the US.
Always, Beijing responded kindly, recently imposing tariffs of 5% to 10% on $60 billion worth of American goods.
The world's second-largest economy promises to be able to match the US's gun for gun, and it is unlikely to recover anytime soon.
To convince Washington to back down, one would have to pay attention to coercion, but Chinese president Xi Jinping would be so ashamed to show a low profile in the US.
However, businessmen say Beijing could benefit from US trade disputes in the long run by reducing the cooperation of the two economies if its cards are played well.
"Abigail Grace, a research associate specializing in Asia at the Center for American Innovation, a thinker, said: "The fact that an early political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the country to begin economic growth is more dangerous than the observer has previously suggested.
Syria is preparing for the return of refugees, according to the foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to return the refugees with a conscientious objection and makes a charitable request for help in rebuilding the country hit by more than seven years of conflict.
The country is in a good place, said Walid al-Moualem, the foreign minister, speaking to the UN General Assembly.
"Thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure", he says.
To return to normal, the authorities are continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists.
All the conditions now exist for refugees to return willingly to the country where they were forced to flee due to the terrorist attacks and the combined economic sanctions that have hit their lives and livelihoods.
Since the start of the war in 2011, the UN believes that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country.
Aid is needed for the remaining six million in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would appreciate the help it would provide to rebuild the collapsed kingdom.
But he stressed that no aid or assistance would be accepted if it did not come from the countries that supported the revolution.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
At Le Golf National in western Paris, Team Europe defeated Team USA to win the 2018 Ryder Cup 16.5 to 10.5 in the final score.
The US is probably best placed in Europe, and has not won a Ryder Cup there since 1993.
Once the Danish team led by captain Thomas Bjorn had the 14.5 points needed to defeat the Americans, Europe regained the top position.
US tour star Phil Mickelson hit his tee in the water with a par-3 16 holes, awarding Francesco Molinari the win.
Since the current tournament format was introduced in 1979, only four players have finished 5-0-0, with Italian golfer Molinari shining in every tournament.
Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the youngest player in the European team, defeated American Jordan Spieth 5&4.
Dustin Johnson, who is currently ranked world No. 1, was played against England's Ian Poulter, who may have participated in his last Ryder Cup, 2 and 1.
With his 25.5 lifetime and eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the all-time leading European.
"I don't often cry, but today I can't stop.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Tomas chose me and trusted me.
I am so happy, I am so happy to have the cup back.
After the European victory, Garcia said, "It's about the team, and I'm happy I can help.
He then handed the stone to John Ram, a fellow countryman who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
"I grew up watching Tiger Woods, so the pride I feel about defeating him is amazing", says Rahm, 23.
Woods has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3 after playing all four matches in France
One of the greatest golfers of all time had an outstanding record, coming second to Jack Nicklaus in the major championship winning 14.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played well throughout the tournament, Team USA struggled throughout the weekend to find the course.
After his team's decline, US captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we spent a little heat in Europe.
We destroyed it.
Thank you to Thomas.
He was a great captain.
His twelve sons all performed beautifully.
We'll focus again, I'll be with our Ryder Cup Committee and the PGA of America, and then we'll continue.
I am happy to be the captain of these 12 heroes because I admire them.
You have to throw your hat.
We won".
Red Tide update: Rate of interest to Sarasota, Pinellas, and Manatee
In some areas of the Tampa Bay region, Red Tide levels are often reduced, according to the latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission.
The FWC reports more flourishing conditions, related to decreased emissions, in parts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties.
From Pinellas north to Lee south, a flowering red tide covers 130 miles of shoreline.
Some 10 miles outside Hillsborough County, some skins are available, though in a few smaller areas than a week ago.
Pasco County also reported seeing red tide.
Low to high outdoor ratings in Hillsborough County, high ratings in Manatee County, high ratings in or outside Sarasota County, medium ratings in Charlotte County, high ratings in or outside Lee County, and low ratings in Collier County have all been reported in the past week.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties, breathing is still being observed.
Last week, there were no reports of tornadoes in Northwest Florida.
