This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but it can also provide details that fossils normally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's fur is brownish-brownish on top with a pale or carotenoid undercoat.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed stem, called a rachis, but had other features - thorns and barbules - researchers concluded that rachis may have been a later evolutionary development than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature or appearance regulation.
The researchers suggest that although this is a dinosaur's baby tail, the sample shows adult bird feathers, not chicken feathers.

"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes" "that journalists seem to be walking a dangerous path if they publish photos of suspects, etc".
The Crown Office, which is overall responsible for the prosecution, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the charges are laid.
The document, according to the leak, would refer to the border dispute, which the Palestinians wanted based on the border before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reported were the future of Jerusalem, which is sanctified by both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement was signed, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to a military presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control trials must be closely monitored by the guards as the trials are monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received thorough training and safety instruction.
Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a calculation package to move the country towards new elections.
The inspection was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the cancellation of elections that were supposed to be held since 2011.
There were 60 reported iPod malfunctions characterized by overheating, resulting in six fires and four minor burn injuries.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had learned of 27 accidents related to the device.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional heat incidents, which the company called "not serious".
"The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana at 0719 local time (2119 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said that no damage was reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer kidnapped a Hong Kong tourist by hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 into the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, have been released early, as have the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old lady who wanted to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as a gynaecologist and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births during her free time.
His research showed that when given hormones, the fetal lungs mature faster.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen, my first manager, "Luna died on the night of the second moon, "unique as she was, a strong woman".
"Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as scary as I was... maybe even more... I loved her and would miss her... hope she's in a better place now".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
In a poll on this view, 34 percent of them wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last head of Australia's monarchy.
In an extreme poll, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the triple relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, her fitness status was also in doubt.
He could not take the medication needed to treat his pain, because it was banned from the Olympic Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Some people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and the announcement was made on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets are the source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, particularly how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth in the distant past.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
"He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
He speculates on running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It utilizes satellite-based technology, rather than the older radar-based technology on the ground, to make it easier for air traffic controllers to locate the exact location of aircraft with better precision and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport will be operated and no diesel trains will stop at Wembley.
Concerns about lack of transportation increase the possibility that the match will be forced to be played indoors without supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reports the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species evolved in just two generations, a process previously believed to take longer due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into many shapes, including small shapes.
Gold could be pulled into thin wires, twisted and woven, forged or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made so thin, it can stick to other metals, or it can be made so thin that it's sometimes used as a hand-painted decoration in books called "light-lit manuscripts".
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acid or alkaline chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
A hydrogen ion is a proton whose electron is stripped (as a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders together, then press them into balls with wet clean hands.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of drainage systems have been found in many houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also used. In Roman civilization, toilets sometimes merged with public baths, where men and women used them together.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
Satellites in space receive the call and bounce it back, almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere changes some of our light and our vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
It takes us to trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
The medium-sized cats below prey on medium-sized animals, such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray cats) that eat much more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special job that each cat does to keep them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult male siblings, along with 30 females and their offspring.
The females are usually closely interwoven with each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride behaves like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull 5 times as hard as a human.
Tigers are still a group (Genus Panthera) with lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a full-bodied lion, but more like a sentence whose words are uttered in a roaring, shouting sound.
The ocelot prefers small animals, and will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can.
Scientists speculate that the ocelot follows and searches for prey by scent, sniffing the tracks of prey on the ground.
They can see clearly in the dark with their night vision, and they also move very quietly.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from its original main population (as if they move to a mountain or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find a different environment from the one they occupied before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different features or adaptations to be able to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they seem to shrink like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this the process of speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they breathe in the carbon dioxide that humans emit (which is, they breathe).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time so it was not afraid of anything but its fellow mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with extra rows of teeth at the top of its mouth, meaning that nothing can escape when it passes through.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that his tongue was branched, and his food included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have been a cannibal all along.
It also attacks anything that gets into the water, including giant dinosaurs like T. rex that can't compete with it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans did have a share in strange or unusual feast foods, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a rat.
And the rich enjoy a meal while they are sitting down and enjoying themselves.
Ancient Roman food could not bring food that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the home of the gods.
Citizens would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and a sanctuary inside that was only for the priest.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special shelter for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home is not so important.
Most Jewish family life took place in the open.
Women cooking in the yard, shops used to be just open counters facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, which explains why timber was so expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his way west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavia', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Despite the writing on the back, this document is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early papyrus documents were large (29⁄4 by 24 1⁄2 inches) and were rolled up for preservation.
So, that notation was most likely just inserted as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"The region was ruled by the French "Vichy". They were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them".
"The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940, an invasion dubbed Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks American and Free French troops had liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture run together by a group of people who live and work together, as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, in relation to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or cities, and it also became a measure of the size of a society.
The city-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilization culture means the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the remaining cultural traces, and the natural spread.
Minority cultures usually disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as a viable civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to impose taxes. Because there is no national executive or judicial branch, Congress relies on state authorities, which are often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
It also has no authority to override interstate tax and tariff regulations.
The articles require unanimous consent of all states before they can be changed, while the states ignore the central government so their representatives are often absent.
Italy national football team, also Germany national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was the winner of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Nordic region, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) making it the 7th largest island in the world
"As a result of the island clusters that Japan possesses, Japan in geographical terms is often referred to as an "island"
Taiwan's origins go back to the 15th century when European sailors who passed by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, and initiated a transformation in local grain production practices and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice fields and plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can get a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still in production today, but more importantly the aspect of ratios has been inherited by the digital camera image sensor format.
The actual 35 mm format, somewhat confusingly, is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS group formats) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The third rule that is most often violated and underestimated is a simple guide that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It is said that the most effective place for such a main subject is the meeting of lines that separate the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During the historical period in Europe, the Catholic Church (which had become wealthy and powerful) was under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European nations despite their different languages and customs.
Its far-reaching power affected everything from kings to commoners.
One of the tenets of Christian teaching is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this centralization of power and money led many to question whether this teaching had been fulfilled.
As soon as hostilities broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain set mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering all parts of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, the Germans suspected a similar response to their unstoppable submarine battle.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, many nations resolved to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of denoting different periods of time; each stage in China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
The most popular of these is the epic of the Three Kingdoms, which takes place in the 60-year interval between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce battles were fought between the nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the highest seats in the great palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political impacts such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolute government to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belonged to the people, not to one ruler.
Furthermore, after the revolution, job openings were opened to all male applicants, opening up opportunities for success to the most ambitious.
The same is true for the military because instead of ranking soldiers based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class citizens from other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life.
He confines himself, which endures through time, giving a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Perched atop a mountain north of Mecca City, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even when one knows it exists.
The sky above is clear and mountains surround it, and little is seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau, or "Nepro-Gizan Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead has several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a great Sphinx.
The great pyramids were created in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
"The up arrow looks like a V and the down arrow looks like a staple or a square without a bottom".
Up means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upward friction usually produces a softer sound, while downward friction is stronger and more firm.
Feel free to write your own sign, but there is a musical reason for the printed arrow sign, so usually the sign must be obeyed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
They journeyed back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and calling for threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their train windows wide.
At one point, one of the mob members shook the head of the royal guard who was killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The U.S. imperialist war expenses of conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to finance most of the spending and bond interest floating on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The profits made from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are of course a fundamental advantage for US imperialism.
To understand the story, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the command.
The era in which these events occurred is usually called the High Middle Ages of the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The heyday of the Middle Ages ran from the Early Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, ending around 1500 by convention.
Technological determinism is a term whose practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological drives or technological necessity to the strict understanding that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic related to scientific laws as well as their technological manifestations.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism contain two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology ultimately has an inherent "effect" on society, rather than being merely socially conditioned".
For example, one might say that the car should lead to the development of highways.
Nevertheless, the national highway network was not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of automobiles also led to high rates of road accidents, which ushered in the invention of new techniques in the medical world to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism has considerable elements of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and cultures associated with that geography emerged, and these, in harmony with the place of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury lasted from 400 to about 1100.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, particularly as the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
At that time the title of Fashion Capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, western trends can lag by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop their own styles. One of the biggest developments of the time was the Crusades, when people began to use buttons to tighten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic, system that uses stored seeds from the ecoregion, combined with rotational cultivation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in self-sustaining agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that distinguish one subculture from another may be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures typically mark their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles, among them fashion, temperament, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to exploit some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, are not socialized by adults as they grow up.
Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this neglect of the child is due to the parent's refusal to respond to a child's severe intellectual or physical disability".
Wild children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; some said they had lived in the wild by themselves.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, feral children display behavior (in physical limits) almost entirely like that of certain animals that care for them, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
Whereas project-based learning was supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffold can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a scaffold but so is a small paper clip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolding is internalized in software and aims to question, encourage, and explain procedures that may be too big a challenge for students to solve alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even blackmail.
Children are not supposed to grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, care for, and educate, but that's the reality.
We consider the foster care system a safe zone for these children.
Our care systems are supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster family should provide for all the needs that were not available in the home where they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to an additional dimension in terms of use and approaches to gratification.
"For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations in Internet use (James et al., 1995). "
"Personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recorders led to the important discovery of the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements, which occur in milliseconds.
Specifically, it states that we can detect whether someone is lying by observing their micron expression correctly.
In his paper entitled The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks shows how a person who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately judge sincerity.
He even proposed that the ability to interpret such human behavior might be possessed by animals such as pet dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two genetic variants: hidden and revealed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the group of variations of expression.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to meet their amino acid needs from available plant sources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences, including growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest source of plant protein is in leaves and nuts, but it's hard for primates like us to digest unless it's cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide high amounts of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
"All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors tackled the "protein problem" in a way that is almost similar to the way chimpanzees in the savannah do today".
Sleep disruption is the process of you waking up intentionally during a normal sleep period, then falling asleep a few minutes later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively silent alarm clock to alert you without fully waking you.
If you reset the clock while you're asleep, then the clock can be put on the other side of the room, forcing you to stand up and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing people to wake up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force that exists.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism took its foundation from Buddhist teachings, but later expanded it with the focus of Mahayana love and with many techniques from Indian Yoga.
At its core, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of love for all.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is evoked through yoga postures, breathing exercises, spells, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the God of Yoga. Through the visualization of various gods the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which resulted in cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
That war would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in real life, by proxy troops, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Polish defenses were broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge.
However, this plan became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian guards after invading eastern Polish territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods over long distances is the most efficient way to move people and goods in large numbers across the ocean.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country is able to maintain its ability to move people and goods, and at the same time, to block your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most important and recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, when the Americans tried to move troops and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which used mostly U-boats, tried to prevent this congestion.
If the Allies fail, Germany may be able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise goats for their milk, fur, meat, and skin.
The goats were usually used to watch over herds that wandered into hills or other grazing areas.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted of only parallel planks, the horse could pull the train faster and pull more weight than the slightly rougher roads at the same time.
Rail bearing was introduced from the beginning to hold the track in place, but it was gradually realized that the track would be more efficient if it had a layer of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels on the train to break down more quickly.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first railway was born made entirely of iron.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and with the appearance of Homo erectus two million years ago, humans began to walk upright.
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithcus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living environmentally friendly lives, we can join environmental movements, and we can even become activists to reduce our future impact.
It's like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to deactivate it.
It is quite clear that the world is advancing because of science and technology, and overpopulation and a wasteful lifestyle are becoming a major problem.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was brought several blocks to John Dunlap's print shop.
"Over the course of the night about 150 to 200 specimens were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides"."
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today.
A lot of people don't think they're dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, as in computer jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to make an early diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be seen in the presence of open storage of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to a particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from a long-standing familiarity with the rotten tick, which is an insect that is extremely adaptable as a parasite on humans.
Both the Killer Beetle and the Bed Bug are nidicolous animals, adapted to live in their nests or host houses.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 registered cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a major neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
Couples can decide that it's in their best interest, or the best interest of their children, to raise a child.
The couple can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parent withdraws custody of the child so that another partner can have custody of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
It's not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations as well as guide scientific research.
Naturists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific problems, including psychology, were accepted.
As interest in Greek knowledge waned, the West found that it was being torn from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many who pay attention to rhythm in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely a response to external periodic cues, have been recorded for most living things, including fungi, bacteria, animals, and plants.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue the period of the cycle running freely even when no external signal is present.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals to state that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They've done two experiments, which is labeling the DNA inside the phage with radioactive phosphorus and labeling the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of a mutation can vary, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cell is a germ lineage cell.
Only mutations in the germline can be passed on to the child, while other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to natural areas to enjoy natural scenery, including wildlife and plants.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as learning about ecosystems.
Visiting, taking pictures, and learning about orangutans in Borneo are among them.
Every morning, people leave a small town by car to go to work and run into other people whose work is the place they just left.
In this shuttle, which is a dynamic transportation system, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on personal cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has released the biosphere from one of its stable states that for the past two million years has supported human evolution.
Everyone is involved in the community and uses the transportation system.
In the developed world, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why are there such complaints about the transportation system, why do their services always fail? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with a 100% degree of certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be more or less represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flows, a relationship has been established between three main characteristics: (1) track, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to explore space, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings in line with their bodies.
This gives them a wider choice of small-scale places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the dragonfly and the dragonfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some think he is right, but many believe otherwise; the solar system including the Sun (and even other stars) moves around the Earth.
It seems to make sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the first largest river on Earth, carrying eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at about six miles [9.6 km] wide.
About 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers to the oceans on the planet comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and drains thousands of tributaries.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale and technical perfection of the Giza pyramid construction was never surpassed.
The Neo-Egyptian Empire of ancient Egypt admired the monuments of its predecessors, which were then over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of the people who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four properties of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they changed into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, an alloy metal is a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are metals.
You could also have an alloy metal that contains a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atom is so small that the dot at the end of this sentence could contain several trillions of atoms.
When it first appeared, the pencil became a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the status and use of pencils have been degraded.
People now write messages on a computer screen, never having to use a mouse.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to form an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, breaking up the core again and releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that atoms tend to break up with little or no contact.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the marshes and thicker under the plains.
There's probably more dark areas on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Satisfaction theory centers on finding what moves people or what interests them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow up.
This theory analyzes the characteristics of people that make them want something, and the factors in the environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two well-known load theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
"Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or women)".
Managers like this have trouble making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, someone turns into an unrecognizable individual, who feels he has to change everything the team has done and do it alone.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to a rift between the leader and the team members.
Virtual teams have the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
"The presence of a real "silent team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) also becomes a unique component of the virtual team".
"The stealth team is a management team where each member reports to the other.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, the processes of an organization working together to solve problems can give rise to innovative new processes to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and share organizational knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to cognition investigation.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavioral changes and some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
It gives us a wealth of information and materials to build simulations that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate jobs that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as they have been built into some home computer applications and video game software.
Frequent times a teacher would gladly take his students to places where they could not use the bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tourism, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing tourism work virtually is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website changes shape, but the old version stays online as a sticky book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students usually start to feel the experience of blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, bloggers began to work on improving the quality of their writing to avoid criticism.
"In addition, blogs also "force students to be more literate about the world around them". The need to satisfy an audience inspires students to be witty and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogs are tools that inspire collaboration, and encourage students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school setting.
"The proper use of blogs "can empower learners to be more analytical and critical: by actively responding to internet material, learners can define their positions in the context of other writings and also outline their opinions on a number of issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and it features art galleries and museums that showcase Canada past and present.
Farther south are Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and its surroundings.
All of these and many other things highlight Ontario as what outsiders consider to be essentially Canadian.
Large areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are even virtually uninhabitable wilderness.
Here's a population comparison that's surprising to many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than in Canada.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most isolated continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, and it flourished in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, it borders the Sahel, and to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Female: Female tourists are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
If you also wear a ring it will be very helpful (don't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what they perceive as harassment and often accompanied by a grasp on her arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to defend your opinion (cultural differences or not, that does not mean it can be tolerated!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya. The city was later named Casablanca by the Spanish traders who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookah pipes, and various geegaws, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma must be thoroughly investigated to understand the state of ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province.
The city is also a base for hiking the Nyiragongo volcano as well as some of the cheapest trips to find the trail of the Mountain Gorilla in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (ojek) to get around Goma.
"In connection with its relatively inaccessible location, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for an exotic and distant land".
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation for tourism, and has an airport.
In 1990, Timbuktu was placed on the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
The site was one of the main stops on the PBS special, The Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
It is a stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (TNK) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the borders of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, it charges an entrance fee and daily maintenance.
It may also be advantageous for one to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to some selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the Hong Kong region and is a place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline resemble a diagram of glittering bars, made even clearer by their reflections in Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon beach just across the river.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is crammed into reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers claimed as theirs and if you're looking for evidence of colonial territory in the past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The forest is not just a mangrove swamp - it also includes some of the trees still standing in the vast forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6.30am and 7.30am.
Inter-district buses are generally full, so it is best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most of the district is served by a small, comfortable and sturdy Japanese Bus Coaster.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical space under the bridge is 15 metres long.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is planned to be completed.
The Guarani are the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups".
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo court in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere throughout the island, in Stanley town credit cards and United States dollars are also commonly accepted.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currencies may be accepted.
Exchange Falklands currency outside the island is almost impossible, so exchange it before you leave the island.
Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, summer there coincides with winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common.
Winters can be extremely cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the number on the thermometer.
"There is no 'rainy' or 'dry' season: the amount of rainfall is almost always the same throughout the year".
Although most of the animals in the park have become accustomed to human contact, the wildlife remains wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from other wildlife.
No matter how tame they may seem, bison, deer, elk, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping their distance, and these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so it's best to keep your distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on Upolu Island and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle led by the Mau movement, peaceful gatherings in the town resulted in the assassination of an important leader: Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's location which includes two harbours.
The North Shore beach (entering the North Harbour district area) is located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas, and most have shade obtained from rows of pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes family-friendly beaches with fine shops lining the shoreline.
"The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's fun and refreshing.
There are plenty of French wines to have, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for the trip.
Local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're afraid.
To Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is something of a novelty: black coffee is espresso, cappuccino comes with a high amount of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian standard, the fruit juice is expensive but delicious.
Many coral tours take place throughout the year, and accidents on coral reefs are very rare.
Nevertheless, listen to the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and heed the safety warnings carefully.
Box jellyfish appeared near the coast and near the mouth of rivers from October to April above 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans.
The saltwater crocodile is not active in the sea, its main habitat being at the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have a deal with a specific hotel, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camping lots, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to consider an offer or obtain other documents for your purpose (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be arranged through the travel agent in advance and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to camp on location, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the show, then you have to come early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there are parts of the festival that will continue playing music until late at night.
Some festivals have camping areas dedicated to families with young children.
If you are sailing in the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as the noise is incredible, especially for those most affected.
The Saint Petersburg cruise includes time in the city.
Casinos usually go to great lengths to optimize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offerings, to keep the mood of the guests, and to keep it on the spot.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness destroys clarity of mind, and all gamblers have come to appreciate the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will drive at high latitudes or across mountainous terrain needs to take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On slippery, snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive like on regular asphalt.
During a blizzard, you can get caught in the rapidly falling snow.
The view may also be limited by snow falling or blown, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are normal in many countries and traffic continues uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and is a highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari is used to refer to a land trip to see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals like elephants and giraffes tend to get close to cars, so standard equipment already allows for good observations.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes prefer to remain hidden and are better seen with binoculars.
"Walking safaris (also called "shrub walks", "hike safaris", or go "walks") include hikes, either over several hours or several days".
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, after the first in 1964.
If you book flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay is announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics had been scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets will be worth about ¥7,000.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if they are not available in the room.
If ironing is not available or you do not want to wear ironing socks, you can use a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric become overheated (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are a variety of ways to purify water, some more effective at fighting specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is considered sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unfamiliar to them in their homeland.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with their power, are not usually included in the pest category.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are duty-free and duty-free in a number of locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save money on such products as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through remote interior areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: there are many steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The speed limit is lower than the previous and subsequent sections - generally 35-40 mpj (56-64 km/h) - and it is important to adhere to it more strictly than the other way around.
Although, oddly enough, mobile phone service is stronger here than anywhere else along this route, say in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite tasty, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbor, Austria.
Dried fruit cakes are common, with apples being cooked into dry cakes all year round, and then there are cherries and plums that are present in summer.
Many German baked goods also serve almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want a small but rich cake, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region you are in.
Curry is a dish consisting of spices and seasonings, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
"Caries can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid".
In the interior of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry cuisine.
There are 17,000 islands to choose from, and Indonesian food is a general term that represents a variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term tends to mean foods originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, serving a variety of simple spicy dishes.
The sanggurdi is a support for the driver's legs that hang on either side of any saddle.
It provides greater stability for the rider, but potentially poses safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in it.
If a rider falls from a horse but his leg gets caught in the sanggurdi, he may be dragged if the horse runs.
First, most drivers wear boots with smooth, narrow heels and soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially British saddles, have safety bars that allow the sanggurdi skin to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Nicknamed South America's Yosemite, Chile's premier hiking destination, the CochamÃ3 Valley has a variety of cliffs and massive granite walls.
The top offers a spectacular view from the summit, and climbers from all over the world continue to make new routes through its limitless walls.
Snow sport downhill, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skiing on snow-covered terrain with a ski or snowboard attached to your feet.
"Skiing became a major travel activity with many enthusiasts sometimes dubbed "ski bums", people who planned their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing dates back to about the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called inland skiing, ski touring, or ski climbing.
It is related to but usually unrelated to ski touring or alpine style climbing, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much sturdier boots and ski boots.
Think of the ski trail as a familiar hiking trail.
When conditions are good, you can travel further than you can walk - but you can rarely go as fast as cross-country skiing without carrying a heavy backpack on a neat track.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it has many independent countries, and under normal circumstances, traveling to some of these countries requires you to apply for a visa and go through the passport control process more than once.
The Schengen zone, however, works much like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each Schengen member state separately, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax authorities define antiques as being over 100 years old.
Definitions vary geographically, when the age limit is shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
A handicraft product can be defined as an antique even if it is younger than a mass-produced similar item.
Deer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and its trade culture is also important to many people and many professions.
Although traditionally, not all Sami have bred deer on a large scale, they live off the harvest of fishing, hunting and similar activities, and use deer primarily as working animals.
Today many Sami work in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in Sami, Sami region.
"Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because of its association with negative prejudices and inaccurate perceptions about the Romani people".
If the country you are going to is the subject of a travel warning, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to seek advice from other governments besides your own, but their advice is designed for its citizens.
For example, Americans in the Middle East are likely to face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views given are usually brief, general, and overly simplistic when compared with more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a general term for dangerous weather phenomena that have the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it varies in type, depending on geographic, topographical, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of bad weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, tornadoes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include snowstorms, cold storms, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of bad weather affecting their area, as this can affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a war zone would need to receive professional training.
"An internet search for "Environmentally Damaging Courses" may yield an address for a local company".
Lessons will generally cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually accompanied by practical experience.
Lessons last for 2-5 days and will involve role playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but publications on the battlefield are few in number.
People planning to have sex-change surgery abroad should make sure that they have brought valid documents for their return trip.
