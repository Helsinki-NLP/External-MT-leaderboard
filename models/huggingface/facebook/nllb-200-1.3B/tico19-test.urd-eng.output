The overall spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) increased rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The overall spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is showing similar trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, while the global COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating at different stages in all countries, depending on the country.
Based on the experience of Italy, hospitals and ICU in several countries should increase their preparedness due to the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients as they will require care in a particularly intensive setting.
On December 31, 2019, a large number of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent was novel coronavirus now known as acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
However, the disease resulting from infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been named as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild respiratory infections, with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
About 14% of cases of COVID-19 are of a more severe nature, requiring hospitalization, while 6% of cases involve those with severe illness requiring intensive care.
The hospitalization rate due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we will assess trends in the overall spread of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 spread further geographically, and the dynamics of the global COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently consistent with that country.
The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of EuroSurveillance, Spiritory et al reported the first European confirmed cases of COVID-19 as defined by the WHO case definition.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported by three French individuals returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were reported in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported since 31 December 2019, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths occurred in Italy alone.
Collecting aggregate data on COVID-19 cases and overall spread
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) only receives COVID-19 case data in every country worldwide from official sources, country health ministries, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to Italy.
As for the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day intermittent total spread of COVID-19 taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We presented the total number of reported cases for each country as of 8:00 am on 15 March 2020 compared to Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day intermittent overall spread of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK in general is as of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall spread of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then accelerated on 28 February 2020 (Content).
This was largely due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the overall spread of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK has shown similar rising trends.
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared to Italy, during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It highlighted that, as of 8:00 a.m. on 15 March, only three weeks earlier or less, the total number of cases in the other 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK had been reported earlier than in Italy.
Our findings indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK is increasing rapidly.
The trends observed in the overall spread of COVID-19 indicate that the global pandemic is growing at a comparable pace in all countries.
Although countries are at different stages, variations in national public health responses and countries may have different definitions of cases and different protocols for patient selection that require testing for COVID-19 confirmation, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors from the affected areas of Italy reported a situation where ca 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on COVID-19 admissions to any hospital and/or ICU are available at EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (figures not shown).
However, recent surveillance data, including the number of reported cases and deaths, must be collected in a systematic manner to complement them.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that in Europe, the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds has changed significantly from 29.2 per 100,000 population in Germany and 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that these countries will have resources more or less like Italy (11 per 100,000 population in 2010 there are 12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds).
Modelling scenarios for healthcare capacity increase, estimates of COVID-19 hospitalizations in each EU/EEA country and UK associated with >90% concern of exceeding ICU bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
As there are so far case clusters in EU/EEA countries and UK-specific regions, and hospitals and ICUs generally define the population of the regional region, priority data on cases and ICUs provides a numbering system for the regional units of NUTS-2 available.
The situation in Italy and current trends in other countries show that the global COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and ICU should prepare themselves for the continued community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the surge in COVID-19 cases, such as in affected areas of Italy, requires health care to be particularly intensive.
As the recent ECDC Rapid Concern Assessment, I identified a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2, which should be accompanied by a shift in approaches from prevention to mitigation, if not implemented early, the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with enough time to understand, recognize and adapt their response.
The Rapid Alert Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries are likely to further increase their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare providers.
Failing this, it is likely that healthcare providers in EU/EEA countries will face an increased need for urgent care in the coming days or weeks due to the increase in cases.
The outbreak of the most serious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 people infected in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in devastating human outcomes.
Like its homologous virus SARS-Cov, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can be spread by bats and causes the same symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS but it affects older people more than young people and women more than men.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this review will help us understand and eradicate this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020, became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people due to the outbreak of the novel viral disease, all the holidays and the urge to stay at home for several weeks.
It is highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the related disease CoV disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to some 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 40,000 patients recovering and 3,000 dying as a result of the virus.
WHO warned that COVID-19 is "public enemy number one" and is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, causes, treatment and diagnosis since the first report on January 7, 2020, and which has been determined to isolate multiple patients.
This review attempts to summarize the creative progress in the new and rapidly developing subject area.
Wherever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to the disease caused by SARS and another CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012).
We will discuss what we have learned so far about diagnosis and prevention of the disease, as well as some of the key questions that remain.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, primarily causing about 15% of common strains 4.
However, in this century, we have two very deadly CoVs, SARS CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the epidemic in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon this terrible disease spread to many other countries with its mortality rate.
So the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus pandemic in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1,1, a pneumonia cluster of unknown origin was first reported to the China National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later the CoV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death occurred in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, infection was reported in health care workers, meaning it could be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, Wuhan was closed to all public transportation and was placed under lockdown.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is believed to be the site of the infection's origin from an unknown source of animals.
On January 30, the WHO declared the pandemic a global health emergency.
By the time this report was published, the disease had already spread throughout China and to nearly 50 countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation is developing rapidly, the final extent and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multivariate study on 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, described another updated description of the epidemic in the table below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but especially those aged 65-30.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread mainly in Hubei and surrounding areas.
The average time of diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 (9-2) days from onset.
The average growth period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The mean time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
According to the mass transit time before the Spring Festival in China, the number of infected people increased rapidly before June 23, 2020.
The patient mortality rate of confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% Cl:1.10-1.86%) and the all-patient adjusted mortality rate was 3.06% (95% Cl: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and complex viruses, which contain a complex of sensory RNA.
They are divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The mulfo spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the peptidylpeptide 4 (DPP4) from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral genes are released into the cytoplasm, then after viral genes are replicated, the genes are enveloped with RNA to form glycocytes and neocortex, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
Over 99.98% of the 10 samples collected from the outbreak site associated with the Wuhan seafood market in Wuhan were genetically identified as SARS-CoV-2, a new beta strain.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Thanks to electron microscopy transfer, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found on the most delicate part of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-cell of SARS-CoV-2 is more weakly associated with human ACE2 than SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV causes less infection than SARS-COV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form novel short-strand encoded by orf3b and secreted by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenesis and may express itself in IFNB, however, there is no known active domain or form of orf8.
On February 18, 2020, Zhao et al., reported complex resolution in the structure of EM at full length of human ACE2 at 2.9 Å particles with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that complexes, in which open and closed mutations were combined as a dimer and ACE2-B0AT1 complexes, can bind two S enzymes, which provide evidence for CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may be a treatment for drug screening in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
and the original intermediate
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both originating in bats, have been transmitted to humans via seated cats and camels.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be local representatives of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs of bats, Bet-SL-CoVZX45 and Bet-SL-COVZX21.
However, it is not yet known which intermediate agent helped to break through the barriers to infecting humans, and the route of transmission is still unclear.
G, Yt, Al, suggested that snakes were a vector of virus pathogens from bats to humans, including homologous rearrangements within S proteins.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that according to a study, the long-snouted pangolins, ant-eating mammals, and 99% of the pangolins detected in SARS-CoV-2 often used in traditional Chinese medicine may be potential intermediates for SARS-CoV-2 based on their genetic homology.
However, the 1% difference in the spread between the two genomes is still a huge difference, so we are waiting for the final results of the comprehensive evidence.
Most physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which can survive for up to 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days in temperatures below 20°C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to UV rays, and to heat of 56°C for 30 minutes, or 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, parasitic acid, chloroform, and other fatty disinfectants, but chloroxidine cannot effectively inactivate the virus.
The general human population lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported.
Thus, we can refer to past studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Typically when a virus attacks a representative, the immune system recognizes that representative through first type receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, T-type receptors (TLRs), NAD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through various methods, viral inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and stimulate its viral antigenetics, accelerating micro-phase fugasetivism.
However, SARS-CoV's N-type leukemia may help to prevent an immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphomas including +CD4 and +CD8 play an important role in cell defense.
T cells of +CD4 stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus and T cells of +CD8 directly kill cells infected by the virus.
Helper T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support the immune cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell functions by causing T cells to apoptosis.
Hormonal immunity including C3a and C5a and antibody supplements are essential to fight viral infections.
For example, MERS-CoV is neutralized by antibodies isolated from a recovering patient.
On the other hand, overuse of the immune system causes a lot of locally produced free radicals that can damage the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst case scenario, many organs stop working and even die.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is characteristic of early clustering, and is more likely to affect older and pregnant women.
It is common in people who have a large number of viruses or who have weak immune systems, and are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the first 425 case studies in Wuhan, the growth period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be an average of 14-1 days, with a maximum of 7-3 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases found that the average growth period ranged from 3 days and 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study showed that the growth period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on 8,866 cases.
It is critical for health authorities to establish effective quarantine times based on the most appropriate growth period to prevent people from transmitting the virus to those who are infected but have not shown symptoms.
Generally, people who have the virus or are infected need to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Often the main and early symptom in COVID-19 is fever, with no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat itching, knee pain, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience respiratory arrest and/ or convulsions within a week of onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients have immediate improvement in acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidity, and freezing.
Patients should be evaluated for early diagnosis with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even with unusual pulmonary imaging.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 found that 98% of patients with fever, 76% with dry cough, 55% with respiratory arrest and 3% with diarrhea require ventilation assistance.
Two recent studies, one of a family cluster and one of an asymptomatic individual, have found similar results about the cause of a cluster.
In comparison, a 2012 study found that MERS-CoV patients also had the primary symptoms of fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of these required ventilation assistance, much higher than COVID-19 patients and MERS was more lethal than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and strep throat (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
It has been shown that fever (100-99%), dry cough (75-29%), shortness of breath (42-40%), diarrhea (25-20%) and sore throat (25-13%) are the main symptoms in SARS patients, and about 20-14 percent of patients require ventilation assistance.
As of 14 February, the global death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, when the number of confirmed cases reached 66,576.
By comparison, as of November 2002, 8,096 confirmed cases of SARS had a mortality rate of 10%.
Based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate for 2,494 confirmed cases of MERS was 37%.
A previous study reported that the R0 reproduction rate of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 reproduction range of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
This Table 1.1 presents a comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and reproduction.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher potential for spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two viruses.
So, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
Often, a cluster begins with a single family or a single gathering or ride, such as a boat.
Most patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients, in the last two weeks before onset.
However, it has been reported that people can retain the virus for up to two weeks without showing symptoms, and patients who recover and leave the hospital may re-infect, which rings a bell to extend the quarantine period.
These patients had low or equal levels of white blood cells at baseline (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphonia with a white blood cell count < 4×109/L including lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and spiritis amnio-transferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had elevated liver and muscle enzymes and blood myoglobin levels, and most patients had elevated C-inactivated leukemia and atherosclerotic leukemia.
In severe cases, the D-dimer, the deficient pharyngoblastoma, was increased, so the number of lymph sites gradually decreased.
The unusual features in chest radiography of COVID-19 patients are marked dimness on the two-way complex shadow or ground glass in the lungs.
Most patients develop into common pneumonia, severe lung pain, and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Respiratory distress syndrome, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and increased fibrosis largely compromise gas exchange.
Inactivation of pneumotitis of type I and type II reduces the level of head factor and increases surface tension, thus reducing the risk of lung proliferation and failure.
So, the worst chest X-ray results are parallel to the extreme stage of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 as per the pathology of SARS and MERS patients and ARDS and viral infections revealed pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation, and medial lymphocyte penetration, and multi-cell sinus cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease.
The use of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
In China, on 13 February 2020, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, the use of medical data for diagnosis (which is no longer entirely dependent on RT-PCR) was started.
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
So, for an effective diagnosis, the history of the disease, the medical records, the lab tests, the radiological results all need to be there.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for the use of CRISPR-based Sherlock technique for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which would use a wide range of dipsticks in less than an hour to detect artificial SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments from 20x10-18 micrlitres/liter to 200x10-18 micrlitres/liter (100-10 copies per micrlitres for input) without the need for equipment.
It is hoped that if confirmed in clinical samples, the new technique will dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with novel CoVs, primary therapists can provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while also trying different therapies that were previously recommended or used to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include recent and potential antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychosocial support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients was suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
Initially SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs, and possibly other organs that express small amounts of ACE2, such as the stomach and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and lung failure are the leading risk factors and the leading cause of death for the patient.
Therefore, to help relieve symptoms and save lives, breathing includes general oxygen, fast flow oxygen, uninterrupted ventilation and mechanically intervened ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory distress may be assisted by the use of modified cardiopulmonary bypass techniques to treat the risk of fatal heart attack or respiratory failure through excess corporeal oxygen membrane (ECMO).
Additionally, for electro-light care, treatment and prevention of secondary infection and septic shock is essential to protect vital organ function in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is said that in patients with SARS and MERS, the immune system overload results in a cytokine stream.
A cytokine stream is a type of systemic inflammatory response that is triggered by a series of cytokine releases including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines engage immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which are a major cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and various organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine strains, especially in severely ill patients.
Cortico-Sterons and two Cesizumab anti-IL6 molecular antibodies have been used to treat cytokine stromal.
Other immunosuppressant treatments for the cytokine stream include; blocking IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibiting JAK; kinetic cell suppression 4; and inhibiting HADC, directed modification of the immune response's T cell.
Steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial in lung disease in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis affecting diagnosis dramatically.
Nevertheless, the use of short courses of multiple doses of corticosteroids in severely ill patients with COVID-19 is recommended with caution.
However, no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, with the intravenous injection of remitisevir in a US patient with COVID-19, the nucleotide enabled anaesthesia was found to be effective.
Remitovir is a novel antiviral drug, initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, Remitovir was also identified as a potential blocker for other single-trapped RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead provided China with a combination of its compounds for a couple of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, with results far exceeding expectations.
In addition, baricetin, interferon-a, lupinavir/retonavir, and ribavirin are recommended as potential treatments for patients with symptoms of severe respiratory distress.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur when treated with lupinavir/retonavir in combination.
The compatibility of this treatment with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from the infectious disease to treat other patients with the disease or to prevent the disease from infecting healthy people.
In fact, most recovering patients have relatively high levels of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) that helps fight pathogenesis and other foreign objects through B lymphocytes and identify and directly neutralize unique molecules on the pathogen.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of recovering COVID-19 patients and was administered to 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms such as inflammation and viral load and blood oxygen deficiency improve within 24 hours.
However, no specific treatment has been developed, so it is necessary to confirm and explain it before suggesting its widespread use.
In addition, as we look at the effects of treatment, some of the risks associated with plasma should also be considered.
For example, antibodies increase the immune response, and can cause cytokine release syndrome, a potentially lethal poison.
Normally, the number of antibodies in the blood is low, and the demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop specific antibodies to fight a global pandemic so quickly.
Identifying the genetic code to isolate B cells from recovering patients and encoding effective antibodies to screen effective antibodies against the virus's essential enzyme is a delicate and challenging process.
So we can speed up the process of making antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various ailments.
However, its effects depend largely on the combination of multiple ingredients in a formula, which is based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine for the diagnosis of a disease.
Many of the active ingredients are unknown or obscure because it is difficult to identify and verify such ingredients or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become a major alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Zhou Feng Ji Lu capsules and Li Huang Cheng Wen capsules have been proven effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
Several provinces in China, including Gansu (63.7 percent), Ningxia (50 percent), and Hunan (50 percent), saw the highest rate of improvement in their patients using traditional Chinese medicine (87 percent), while Hubei province, which used traditional Chinese medicine in only 30 percent of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13 percent).
However, this is a fairly tough comparison, as the effects of this analysis must also take into account many other factors such as the number of patients and the severity.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zheng and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicine (WM) treatments.
They found that the Western medicine plus traditional Chinese medicine group had an abnormally short time to maintain body temperature, relieve symptoms, and stay in the hospital, compared to the Western medicine group alone.
Highly impressive, symptomatically increased symptom (mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality rate (8.8% versus 39%) was unusually low compared to the WM+TCM group.
However, traditional Chinese medicine is still awaiting more thorough and controlled trials of its efficacy and safety on a large scale and in more centers.
It would be interesting to highlight the methods of traditional Chinese medicine healing processes, to explain their effective ingredients or if possible their combination.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients often have a fear of highly contagious and even fatal disease, and those in quarantine experience boredom, isolation and anger.
Moreover, infection symptoms such as fever, convulsions, and coughing, as well as corticosteroids, can cause adverse treatment effects such as insomnia, increased anxiety, and mental stress.
In the early stages of SARS, a series of psychiatric patients have reported persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic arousal, psychotic symptoms, depression, and suicide.
Contact tracing and quarantine as part of public health related to the COVID-19 pandemic can make people more anxious and guilty about the impact of conflict, quarantine, and stigma on their families and friends.
Similarly, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons, those in contact with them, and to the general public who may need it.
Psychosocial support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and its treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are needed to stop the spread of infection in animal enclosures, and susceptible representatives of infected humans, and antiviral therapy is often needed to control emerging virus epidemics.
Efforts have been made to develop an S-hepatitis-based vaccine to produce long-term and vital neutralizing antibodies and/or immunity against SARS.
A vaccine with direct effect was analyzed in animal samples for SARS.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in protecting against viral infection in elderly, lethal challenge specimens, and animals cannot be determined until clinical studies begin.
This is because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported.
In contrast, MERS clusters are still being detected in areas other than the Middle East where there are constant sources of animal viruses.
Vaccine strategies for MERS prevention using virus inactivation, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recovered membrane subunits have been developed, and some of these have been tested on animal samples.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is a challenge due to the long time period (average 18 months) required for vaccine development and dynamic variants of CoVs.
COVID-19 has begun to show its clinical course in thousands of patients as a novel disease.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without any complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is important for health care agencies to design disease diagnostics models to prioritize their services in low-resource areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may be associated with the diagnosis or infection of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33)).
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is now also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily affected people aged 65-30, with 47.7% of the 8,866 patients in the study described above being over 50 years of age.
Patients with a higher risk of underlying autoimmune complications are more likely to require intensive care, and are older than those without complications (average age 66 years instead of 51 years), which is the age of COVID-19 patients as a diagnostic factor.
Gender: As noted above, SARS-CoV-2 affects men more than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000).
Inhibition and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are at risk of severe cardiovascular and respiratory attacks.
Heart attacks are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It's interesting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory results: Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and have been suggested as a potential analytical response to treatment and eventual recovery of the disease.
C-reactivated beta-level correlation is recommended for the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19.
Additionally, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspirin aminotransferase (AST), ALA-nine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase may also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are expressed in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and they are released through tissue damage.
So, they're the traditional targets of heart or liver failure.
Critical clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and temporary improvement in clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other tissues to predict outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, immunosuppression of steroids is commonly used to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage as an adjuvant treatment in infectious disease.
Because high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors experienced avascular osteoncerosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, very low doses of steroids should be used for short-term use in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients experienced unusual stress due to enduring prolonged quarantines and witnessing the unreasonable deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support are essential to relieve these patients of stress and return them to normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, it appears that the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 are different from SARS.
In addition to wrapping in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also wrap in the upper respiratory tract, causing mild to no symptoms like the common cold caused by other CoVs in the early stages of infection.
Therefore, in the early stages or during the developmental period, infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when the patient is severely ill, while transmission is not common in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 pandemic is much more severe than the SARS pandemic and is difficult to control.
At present, in China, efforts are underway to disrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by locking down Wuhan and surrounding cities and by keeping the entire population in continuous quarantine.
While these measures are damaging the economy and other sectors of the country dramatically, it is also reducing the number of new cases, indicating a slowdown in the pandemic.
The most welcome thing is that the pandemic will end in March and its double-swing phase will be in three to four months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which is more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longhi et al., establishing a model for predicting the outcome of a global pandemic, suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that mid-turbine and throat monitors of patients who had recovered from hospital two weeks earlier showed that they were infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the newly identified virus could be the influenza vector.
However, based on the decline in the number of new cases, there are promising indicators in China, indicating that the current strategy is working.
In fact, Ebola was predicted to be a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will become vulnerable to infectious disease transmission and eventually become extinct or remain with humans as a less disease-causing virus.
The following figure provides a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (55).
SARS-COV-2 is transmitted by coughing or sneezing and by direct contact with potentially virus-contaminated material.
The virus is also found in the bowel, which gives it a new possibility of being transmitted from the bowel to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were due to possible non-neuronal infections, including 17 patients and 40 health care providers with pre-existing conditions.
Therefore, humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even those in contact with patients or infected people, should be extremely careful.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is wearing a face mask; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series # 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent droplets from a potentially infected person from traveling through the air or sticking to surfaces of objects, from where they can reach others.
However, only N95 (serial #1860) masks can prevent the absorption of small viral particles from 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of the viral particles can be fully absorbed, SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, both approximately 85 nm.
Even five surgical masks are put together, and the particles can still penetrate them, so healthcare workers who have direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear isolation gowns to reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus probably entered through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare workers should wear transparent face shields or glasses when working with patients.
It is highly recommended for people in affected or potentially affected areas to wash their hands more often than usual with disinfectant soap, to try to quarantine themselves inside the home, and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet from the patient is considered appropriate.
These functions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus in the human world, it is the highest homologous SARS-CoV reported on January 7, 2020, and should be a cause for high alert for China based on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens by saying that the novel virus is less contagious and has limited human-to-human reproduction and that there is no problem in preventing and controlling the disease.
This message significantly calmed the alarm of the public, especially as they were preparing for the Spring Festival, and wasted time in Wuhan to minimise the spread of the disease.
Disease control agencies in China may have learned from this difficulty and made significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be careful when making public announcements as every word matters to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) be sensitive to and react to clinical information rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) restrict control of a potential epidemic, rather than providing relief to the public, in its early stages; and (4) frequently increase public awareness of pandemics and use targeted and influential exercises to periodically test and improve society's response system.
The COVID-19 epidemic began in December 2019 with the novel virus SARS-CoV-2.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of re-emergence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for containment of the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older adults and men more than women and has a higher severity and mortality rate among older adults than among young people.
SARS has a higher death rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, whereas SARS patients do so when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to stop the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads relatively faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
Otherwise, the virus may re-positively infect recovered patients.
These findings dramatically increase the concern about the spread of the virus.
In view of the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several key issues remain to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96 percent genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
Who was the original representative, from bats, of the intermediate species for the transmission of the virus to humans?
Without knowing the answer to # 1 and # 2, we can't effectively slow down the transition process and it could re-emerge at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, how does the virus enter respiratory tract cells and what pathological changes result?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2 expressing cells in other organs?
Without the right answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically engineered during transmission to humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, end like SARS, or continue to be a periodic flu?
This is important, but it may take some time to find the answers to the above and some other questions.
However, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
Animal sources of human coronaviruses
For thousands of years, mutation and adaptation, including humans, have driven the co-evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and their host organisms.
Before 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses such as the common cold.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have tossed a coin to show how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 once again highlighted CoVs and surprised us with its faster transmission and reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an infection that is transmitted from animals to humans and serves to understand the animal origin of HCoVs.
Most HCoVs originated in bats where they are non-pathogenic.
Some HCoVs are also known to be intermediate host organisms of reservoirs.
Identifying host animals that have a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigation of CoV-host organisms in animals provides important insight into the pathogenesis of CoVs in humans.
In this review, we offer an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history, as well as their animal origin and mixed-species transmission.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate between different HCoVs from the perspective of evolution of different viruses and their genetic repair.
In this context, the current outbreak of CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be discussed.
In addition, the implications of antiviral protection on the requirements of successful host organism mutations and disease severity have been highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belong to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of enveloped, positive-sensory, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which use large genetics such as 26 to 32 kBs between RNA viruses, were called "CoVs" because of their crown-like morphology when viewed through an electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have undifferentiated genes that share a similar organization.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into the polymorphic mappings of pp1a and pp1ab.
This polymorphism is followed by 16 more non-structural polymorphism, designated nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome includes ORFs for structural fibrils, including the nodal (S), membrane (E), membrane (M), and neocellular (N).
A large number of specific strain helper proteins are also encoded by different strain CoVs.
Based on differences in the sequence of the strain, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), with the beta-CoV genus comprising most HCoVs and further divided into sub-genera (A,B,C and D).
Phylo-genetic evidence showed that, for the most part, bats and mice form the genetic source of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while the largest stocks of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs are birds.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed the species barrier and some of them have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
Typically HCoV-229, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 cause mild cold and/or diarrhea-like symptoms.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, which may cause lower respiratory tract infections with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations in a relatively higher number of patients.
In the mid-1960s a strain of HCoV-229E, B814, isolated nasal discharge from patients with the common cold.
Since then, more and more information has been gathered through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, before the SARS outbreak, the notion that infection with HCoVs was generally harmless was widely accepted.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is the most devastating in recent history, with the epidemic affecting more than 8,000 people with a mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East outbreak of respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula that spread around the world.
2019 novel (HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19) from 2019, which has claimed over 3,120 lives and infected over 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is sounding and the world needs to prepare for the coming global pandemic SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs originated in animals such as bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence support that all HCoVs have an evolutionary origin in bats, where the viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but exhibit high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented countless medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Animal source tracing of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the factors of natural history, spread strength, and restriction of transmission across species.
It may also assist or guide in the search for SARA-CoV-2 reservoirs, intermediates, and breeding hosts with important implications in preventing future recurrence.
In this review, we will present an overview of the pathogenesis of the source animals, the mixed-species transmission and the HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common idea that the parent viruses of HCoVs are usually non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir host organisms and become pathogenic after migration to their new host organism.
We also study the evolutionary patterns of HCoVs, which often increase transmission with decreased pathogenicity.
The outcomes of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak were also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolated, nasal secretions of mild cold patients of the HCoV-229E strain B814, various CoVs were isolated from various animals including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoVs discovery in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections, and later adapted to grow into WI-38 lung cell lines.
In 10 to 20 percent of cases of patients infected with HCoV-229E, mild cold symptoms including headache, sneezing, discomfort, and inflammation of the throat with fever and cough were reported.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and then inserted into the serial pathway of the brain of small mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of those who have had HCoV-229E, which are not symptomatically different from influenza A viruses and other respiratory tract pathogens such as rhabdomyositis.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were globally distributed, and they are more prevalent in temperate climates during winter.
Typically, both of these viruses have a growth time of less than a week, followed by about two weeks of disease.
According to a volunteer study in humans, infection with HCoV-229E in healthy individuals causes mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have severe infections of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "a common pneumonia", was the first well-documented HCoV-caused global pandemic in human history and is the SARS-CoV etiological agent, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Zhuangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic, which spread across many countries and continents, resulted in 8,096 cases with 774 deaths.
In addition to rapid spread, it was estimated that each case, with a growth period of 4 to 7 days and a viral load limit of 10 days, could increase the incidence of about two secondary cases.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have symptoms of muscle pain, headache, fever, restlessness, and cold, followed by shortness of breath, cough, and breathing difficulties with delayed onset.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function and some elevated creatinine kinases are common in laboratory tests for SARS.
Allular dispersal damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe cases, the lower respiratory tract as well as several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, can be affected, usually with cytokine stroma, which can be especially fatal in patients with low immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the index patient, who had traveled to Hong Kong from Zhuangzhou.
Since then, considerable effort has been devoted to HCoV research.
HCov-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands during late 2004.
It is initially found in young children, the elderly, and patients with low immune function with respiratory disease.
Disease caused by HCoV-BL63 is characterized by inflammation of the nasal mucosa, cataracts, fever, and inflammation of the nasal passages.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a nasal sample of an eight-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was first identified in the Netherlands, it actually spread globally.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of the common respiratory illness, and symptoms are most severe in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with whooping cough, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man in Hong Kong who was hospitalized with pneumonia and inflammation of the urinary tract.
HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with severe asthma, with community-acquired pneumonia and inflammation of the nasal passages.
Similarly, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, which cause mild respiratory illness, have been found worldwide.
These four community-derived HCoVs are highly sympathetic to humans and are generally unlikely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic disease, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons, such as rare cases of a more severe subtype of HCoV-NL63 that caused severe infections in the lower respiratory tract, recently reported in China.
Typically, when these HCoVs have the ability to transmit and persist within humans, they become low-level pathogens or pathogens.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia who suffered from severe pneumonia and kidney failure.
Whereas most laboratory-confirmed cases are in the Middle East, and imported cases are found in European countries and Tunisia with occasional close contacts with secondary spread.
In 2015, a secondary epidemic broke out in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, which has characteristics of advanced severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients develop severe renal failure, which is very unique from MERS in HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30 percent of patients have symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, over 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases accounted for 34.4% of deaths, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses ever found in humans.
During mid-to-late December 2019, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 to be of global concern, a public health emergency, and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 3.4% of those treated dying.
Specifically, in Hubei, China, the death rate is 4.2%, while outside of Hubei, it's 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections and is expressed as fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea has also been seen in some patients.
One of the most severe symptoms is pneumonia, which can exacerbate acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar due to the 82% continuous similarity in high nucleotide, it is a cluster of different branches of the pathology tree.
Apparently the SARS-CoV-2 virus is less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Symptoms of asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 were reported which may have contributed to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparisons and contrasts of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal many interesting similarities and differences.
First, there are very similarities in the duration and duration of disease growth of HCoVs.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the common trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the other four community-acquired (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, it has been commonly observed that SARS-CoV-2 displays its infectious characteristics during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including with nonspecific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as SARS-CoV infection, although this proportion is somewhat lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 shows interesting characteristics similar to community-derived HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the minimum transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the community received from HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed that, as with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced after entry into humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in waste samples.
Although at least in some circumstances that have yet to be clarified in future studies, whether SARS-CoV-2 plays a role in oral waste transfer, as in the case of SARS-CoV.
It will also be of particular interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 will show up seasonally, as will community-derived HCoVs.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 upon entry into humans including transmissibility, pathogenesis and sustained spread will affect the eventual outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
While well adapted in humans, all four community-acquired HCoVs cause mild symptoms.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to all four HCoVs.
In other words, both strains may be the survivors of a global pandemic of primitive HCoVs.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans that are susceptible to severe HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs that collect the desired mutation must replicate in humans to resist host organism restriction to a sufficient extent.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic lasts and the more people it affects, the more likely it is that humans will fully adopt it.
If it is well-adapted, then it will be difficult to prevent transmission to humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, four community-derived CoVs have been circulating in the population, causing the common cold in immunocompromised individuals.
These viruses don't need animal stocks.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs have not adapted well to humans and their transmission to humans cannot be sustained.
They need to grow and breed in their animal stocks, and potentially seek out the opportunity to spread to sensitive human targets through one or more intermediate and expansive host organisms.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-derived HCoVs.
At least for now, it has a greater potential to transmit like community-derived HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-derived HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether humans will fully adopt it and it will circulate in humans without any reservoirs or intermediate host animals.
Before discussing the origin of organisms of HCoVs, it is best to discuss the evolution, nature, stocks, intermediate and extensive determination and characteristics of the animal hosts of HCoVs.
An animal, if it has a closely related racial association, acts as an evolutionary host organism for HCoVs, sharing a high degree of similarity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ethno-virus usually communicates well in the host organism and is non-pathogenic.
Similarly, the host organism harbours HCoVs continuously and for long periods of time.
In both cases, the host organism is naturally infected and is a natural host of the HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if an HCoV is introduced to an intermediate host organism at or before introduction to humans, it cannot adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host organism can serve as an animal source of human infection and then serve as a large-scale rapidly propagating host for human infection in humans.
If HCoVs cannot sustain transmission within the intermediate host organism, it will go into a closed pathway of infection.
Conversely, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate host organisms and even establish long-term nutrition.
In this case, the intermediate host organism becomes the host organism of the natural reserve.
Epidemiological data have disappointingly revealed that SARS index cases have a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent non-proliferation investigations reported that animal traders had higher rates of antagonistic SARS-CoV lgG than the general population.
The first masked palm seated cats (Pygoma larvata) and a recovering dog were identified to have SARS-CoV-like viruses that are similar to SARS-CoV in the live animal market.
This indirectly supports the fact that no SARS was reported after killing all the Seat cats in the markets.
However, it has been reported that masked palm-seat cats from forests or farms were largely negative for SARS-CoV without appearance in the live animal market, suggesting that masked palm-seat cats may only be acting as expansive intermediate host organisms but not as natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV.
In particular, since 80% of the different animals in the markets of Zhangzhou contain antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that several small mammals could act as extensive intermediate host organisms for SARS-CoV.
These all appear to be closed pathway hosts of SARS.
The search for a natural host animal for SARS-CoV resulted in the exposure of a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related Rhinoleaf CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3), which is present in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibody and the genetic sequence of SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other batch CoVs share a 92-88% nucleotide sequence similarity to SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the groundwork for the new idea that bats are the host organisms of human pathogenesis.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none other than a designated WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 obtained from bat waste samples was demonstrated to be used as a receptor for bat, coyote and human ACE2 entry cells.
Interestingly, the recovered SARS patients in Sierra were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest SARS-CoV to the bat genus, sharing a 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
However, despite the extreme similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not directly a parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the host organisms of the immediate storage of SARS-CoV.
Clusters of MERS-CoVs of the same group were phylogenetically analysed as Bet CoV-HKU4 and Bet CoV-HKU5.
Both CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same representative receptor, dipopytel peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA-dependent RNA polymers sequences of MERS identified from Europe and Africa are polygeneally closer to counterparts in Beta-Ta-CoV.
So far, no live MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closely related bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Thus, bats cannot be the host organism for the immediate deposition of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East showed that in several African countries, like the Middle Eastern camels, a cube camel was seropositive for a MERS-CoV-specific inactivating antibody.
MERS-CoVs similar to viruses found in humans were isolated from the nose of a camel with a conch, further indicating that camels serve as the true host organism reservoir for MERS-CoVs.
It is noteworthy that experimentally, camels infected with MERS-CoV generally showed mild symptoms but a large viral outbreak.
In particular, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the oral waste, which is also the primary route of virus flow from bats.
However, questions remain as there is no history of multiple confirmed cases of MERS prior to onset of symptoms being associated with camels, including human-to-human transmission or unidentified animal species, which harbor MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Ranulops beta shares 96.2% nucleotide similarity with the CoV RaT13 beta.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, it is very good to assign paternal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.
I mean, bats cannot be a direct host organism for SARS-CoV-2 unless a near-match bat CoV is found in the future.
Most likely, Hunan's seafood wholesale market, which has many early cases of COVID-19 associated with and potentially indicative of animal-to-human transmission, will be the intermediate host animal for the wildlife species of SARS-CoV-2 to be sold and killed.
Several recent studies based on meta-genetic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered mammalian microorganisms known as pangolins (Mans javanetica) may also harbor SARS-CoV-2 related paternal Beta CoVs.
These novel pangulin CoVs share 85-92% nuclear tissue sequence similarity with the SARS-CoV-2 gene.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with approximately 90% identification at the nucleotide sequence level.
These phylogenies are clusters of sub-lineages similar to SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the genetic tree, with one of the 97.4% amino acids sharing a continuous identifier, as well as a receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, despite a high degree of consistent genetic range, are more diverse.
Previous studies of diseased pigolins have reported the presence of post-viral, similar to the related SARS-CoV-2, in lung samples.
This study used partial genetic sequencing, which is about 86.3% of full-length viral genetics, different assembly methods and manual protection.
We cannot rule out the possibility that penguins are one of the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support direct SARS-CoV-2 from the source of pangolin due to sequence differences between the beta CoVs of SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related beta CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, penguins, and other mammals has yet to be established.
While, the best sequence similarity has been found in the receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARA-CoV-2 related beta CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the best broad genetic sequence similarity.
It is highly speculative that selective mediation between the high degree of similarity in receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and Pegolin SARS-CoV-2 related B-CoVs is driven by careful evolution.
A third wildlife variant, Penguin SARA-CoV-2, was counter-proposed in favour of recombination between Beta CoVs and RaTG13.
The widespread spread of the B-CoVs is present as a driving force in evolution.
The direct animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be determined.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, animal sources of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have been the original source of bat CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
It has been reported that a bat CoV in the North American Triangle Bat, termed ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge Cov), has shown close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another variant CoV, the so-called hepospondrosis/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana/Ghana
For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origin of identified HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylo-genetic analysis has provided evidence of historical incidents of mixed-species transmission of HCoVs.
When the domesticated live stock HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans around 1890, a global epidemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E's mixed-species transmission is less clear.
Beta-alpha-CoVs have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpha-CoV.
Multiple evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, the common ecological niche could be human-bat interaction, not volcanic.
Instead, humans are closely related to algae.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bat, while alpaca alpha CoV is caused by respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha CoV was not found in pets.
Thus the possibility that alpacases acquire HCoV-229E-related alpha CoVs from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenetic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Napa, and Handra viruses.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where beta-alpha CoVs serve as a gene pool for an HCoV-229E, alpacas and camels may serve as intermediates, much like MERS-CoV cases, which transmit the virus to humans.
MERS-CoVs serve as the best example of mixed-species transmission from bats to one-horned camels and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats is known as its early identification and is also reinforced by subsequent findings.
Apparently, genetic fragments and international transfers and exchanges provide a rich pool of bat-like viruses.
Longevity, dense colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly, are favorable conditions for bats to become an ideal 'virus-spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into a camel for decades.
It has adapted well in camels that have evolved from direct host organisms to stable and nature reserve host organisms.
MERS-CoV maintains a very mild morbidity and relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its occasional transmission to humans is accidental and humans are closed path host organisms of MERS-CoV as they cannot sustain its transmission.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, pangolin B-CoVs are highly pathogenic to pangolins.
They may be a barrier host organism for SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV, which is similar to the seated cats in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies may include or rule out multiple possibilities of animal-to-human mixed-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
First, bats may be the source of the SARS-CoV-2 host organism, which is almost identical to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Humans share an ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be one of the fastest intermediate host organisms, with the SARS-CoV-2 related virus being newly introduced.
Humans transmit the virus through butchering and hunting.
It is possible that several mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies are guaranteed in domestic and wild animal surveys.
Third, as described above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in third species that interact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal sources of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of host animals, CoVs are important in facilitating three major factors by the virus in crossing a variety of barriers.
First, they have relatively high rates of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the determined mutation rate of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average mutation rate per year at each site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of the novel host organisms to CoV, as 10-4 mutations.
CoVs have proof-reading external bony cells, whose deletion results in better mutability, attention, and even inactivity.
Interestingly, the new cleotide analog remedy is known to suppress the replication of CoVs through its external bonuclease and inhibition of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Remdesivir is the most intelligent agent tested as an antagonist of SARA-CoV-2 in clinical practice.
However, the rate of mutation of CoVs is a million times higher than that of their host organisms.
In addition, often times when CoVs cannot adapt well to the host organism, there is a high rate of mutation.
Compared to the highest rate of SARS-CoV mutation, the apparently well-adapted SARA-CoV-2 has a low rate of mutation in humans.
It's probably already adapted to another host near humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, which adapts well in a camel, is also applied.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that enhanced genetics will render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 immediately ineffective.
Second, the genetics in CoVs demonstrate the use of additional modulation in genetic modification for large RNA changes and recombination, thus increasing the probability of cross-evolution of mixed variants, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by the decoding of multiple unique reading frames and Behmia functions towards the 3' end of the genome.
Third, through the unique mechanism of "copy selection", CoVs often switch randomly to RNA moulds.
During replication of CoV RNA, the host organism, which acts as a mixer, frequently changes its spine.
A full-length rearrangement of ultra-homologous and subgenetic RNAs may be used to produce new CoVs.
Evidence of natural phylogenetic cross-linking has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
The transmission of the virus is mediated by the host organism's communication
In addition to the above three viral factors, viral interaction with the host organism receiver is an important factor in effective and mixed-species transmission.
With this, the SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example, which gave evidence of positive selectivity during mixed-species transmission.
In addition to comparative analysis of human and mouse isolates of SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoVs are thought to be rapidly adapting to different host organisms, particularly with a mutation of the S-hemisphere receptor-binding domain.
In general, the receptor-binding domain in the S-hemisphere of CoVs interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host organism's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain on the S1 fragment is the 318th to 510th amino acid, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its co-receptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV receptor is able to identify the ACE2 receptor for the binding domain that allows the mixed-species transmission of the virus to various animals, including bats, seahorses, rats and raccoons.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues in the receptor-binding domain were found to be different in human and cats isolated viruses, 4 of which are found in the form of receptor-binding to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations, which may enhance the interaction of the pituitary gland with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids may be important sub-substitutes for viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy, however, that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S-cell indicates that the essential affinity of its S-cell to human ACE2 may be altered.
Indeed, a pulsed electron microscope study is suggesting that the association between human ACE2 and the S-cell of SARS-CoV is -10 to -20 times greater than the association between human ACE2 and the S-cell of SARS-CoV.
It will also be interesting to determine whether any other subreceptor is needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetyl sialtic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can account for successful adaptation of these CoVs after mixed-species transmission from their host animal to humans.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of HCoV mixed-species transmission is monitored, depending on another host organism and via binding factors.
The spread of these host vectors between humans and natural reservoirs of HCoVs, such as bats, a camel and mice, may hinder mixed-species transmission.
HCoVs have both antagonist host-dependent factors and disruptive host-binding factors for successful mixed-species transmission.
In this regard, the molecular characteristics of this critical part of the virus's interaction with the host organism have yet to be identified and determined.
Neutral wide-ranging genetic testing of host organism dependence and binding factors for SARS-CoV-2 could be beneficial using the latest technology in CRISPR.
Emission of novel HCoVs: back to zero ground
Bat CoV diversity provides ample opportunities for the release of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also accelerate the evolution of HCoVs and serve as two important steps in the process.
Acquisition or loss of the novel lymphocyte coding gene, for example, has the potential to rapidly change the phenotype of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV helper enzyme, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but found to have different ORF8 enzyme encodings.
In strains isolated early in the human epidemic, the 29 nucleotide-deadening properties of SARS-CoV were identified.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is a favorable mutation that promotes migration in host organisms.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with sequences of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where RNA-dependent RNA polymerases were identified in large numbers with small regions of recombination.
The sites of recombination were identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has also been observed that the MERS-CoV outbreak, which occurred in a camel in Saudi Arabia, experienced incidents of cross-strain recombination.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, re-synthesis events have also been observed in other CoVs, in which HCoVs re-synthesize with their non-structural genetics with CoVs from other animals.
It should also be warned that artificial selection may contribute to unreported changes in viral genetics, potentially avoiding selective stress, such as the host organism's immune system, resulting from getting rid of the virus.
An example of this effect is the loss of the full length of ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229 E, which results in the deletion of two nucleotides.
Although ORF4 persistence can be observed in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses, Alpaca shows a single neocloid entry of alpha-CoV, resulting in frame shift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by selective stress in their reservoir host organisms.
When bats are infected with CoVs, one is symptomless or mildly symptomatic, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appears that bats are anatomically and physically well adapted to CoVs.
For example, defects in activating the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology induced by CoVs.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed by low levels of expression of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the large histocompatibility complex class I salts.
Furthermore, reactivating high levels of the bat's high metabolism-generated oxygen species (ROS) by suppressing replication of both CoVs, and influencing proof-reading by exorbitant bonuclease to form highly pathogenic virus strains, provides selective stress when a new host organism is introduced.
More pathogenic CoV strains may be produced through recombination, which can cause the novel organism to grow to acquire biomechanical or biomechanical properties for adaptation to the host organism.
So, it's no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their host organisms such as bats and camels.
They replicate robustly without the immune response of a powerful host organism.
In it, the secrets of why the asymptomatic pathogens are shown and what causes the severe cases in human infections are hidden.
Severe symptoms are primarily due to the hyperactivity of the immune response and the cytokine stream, which is a strong immune response, causing more severe lung damage.
In contrast, in an asymptomatic vector, the immune response has been de-coupled from the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy of immune response inhibition has a beneficial effect in the treatment of antagonist SARA-CoV-2.
The interferon reaction is particularly powerful in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon should be beneficial, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the inflammatory activity of NLRP3 in bats is defective.
Therefore, NLRP3 anti-inflammatory therapy with MCC950 may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak follows the common belief that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have emerged.
Where a bat Bta CoV has been found to share 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, there is a bat-CoV that is sharing 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While seals and other animals in the market have been found to harbor SARS-CoV-like viruses, the direct intermediate host organism of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Penguin B-CoVs have been found to be surprisingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, meaning that either the penguins are acting as one of the intermediate host organisms or the penguin B-CoVs may contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2 through genetic fragmentation.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
CoVs have resurfaced due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studies of CoVs in bats and other animals have radically changed our ideas about animal sources and animal stocks of HCoVs in human transmission.
Extensive evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via an intermediate host organism.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is caused by human-seed contact in markets, the SARS epidemic can be effectively eliminated by closing meat markets and killing seeds.
Therefore, given the discovery of multiple strains of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from meat markets to prevent transmission from animals.
However, future investigations have yet to clarify when and where SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in a camel for a long time.
For the local people, these camels are the primary source of meat, milk, leather, and wool, as well as an important means of transportation.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
So just like what was done in Chinese markets to stop the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS.
To stop the recent spread of MERS, along with other infection control measures, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop an effective vaccine against MERS for camels.
Since we can't kill these viruses, they can cause new genetic variants to emerge.
Different species of animal CoVs are circulating in the forest.
In particular, bat CoVs with variation in animals are highly diverse.
As a result of the emission of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal in humans in the future, there are many opportunities for animal CoVs to evolve and reproduce.
In some parts of China, wildlife eating should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 trials, better preparedness and response plans must be in place.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reserves until they have a chance to grow.
Although bats have many characteristics that cause the spread of viruses, if people are educated, the chances of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for a better understanding of CoV and its natural hosts, which will be effective in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future spread of the epidemic.
Consequently, by keeping humans away from the environmental niche of natural reserves of animal-to-human viruses, the transmission of animal-to-human viruses can be prevented more effectively.
Several pieces of the puzzle of animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if a bat transmits an ethnic virus of SARS-CoV-2 to a penguin, it would be interesting to see under what conditions the bat and penguin might share the same environmental power.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, then how humans come into contact with bats must be determined.
Third, if the third mammal acts as a true intermediate, it would have to explain how it interacts with other species, including humans, bats and penguins.
Finally, because many other mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, they should be both monitored and tested for infection.
If bats, penguins or any other mammals are present, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 and its almost identical parent virus will be identified in its natural representatives.
Continued research in this field will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans as well as explain the evolutionary journey of SARS-Cov-2 in animals.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published the Rapid Advisory Guidance for Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection.This guideline provides our experience and is a good reference for fighting the global pandemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and is gradually increasing in our awareness and knowledge based on the results of ongoing research and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guidelines, issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, stating that we provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspect case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (version 7).
In December 2019, an outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), occurred and the virus was renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid advisory guide and it was published online on February 06, 2020 in Military Medical Research.
It has received a lot of attention since its publication.
Note however that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued a Diagnosis and Treatment Guide for COVID-19, with a total of seven issues released from January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, with some fundamental changes in the context.
Now our guide has received a comment from Zhao et al., who suggested a simple score based on his medical experience.
Their work added new evidence to our guide and is a valuable reference for the global pandemic.
We acknowledge and thank them for their outstanding work.
However, their work also needs to be updated to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh issue (March 3, 2020), confirming a suspected case requires a comprehensive analysis combining one feature of the epidemic history with two items of medical evidence, or combining three items of medical evidence without a clear history of the epidemic:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel or residence history in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) Wuhan city and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms; (4) history of contact with clusters of confirmed cases (with fever and/or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks in a small area such as home office, school classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with conceptual characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) indicates normal, decreasing, or low lymphocyte count in early onset.
Pathogenetic or serological evidence should include a confirmed case diagnosis on a suspected case with one of the following items: (1) being positive on real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of whole viral genetics of known novel coronaviruses showing high sequence; (3) being positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific lgM antibody and lgG antibody in serum testing; or being negative to positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific lgG antibody or ≥4 times higher than the recovery phase in severe stage of TYR.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) issues.
Pathogen detection in blood samples was included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issues; and serological evidence was included in the seventh issue.
Investigator-based modifications are underway to find the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis in the verified standard, as well as to take respiratory tract including blood samples that increase the availability of different samples, and help bring positive results for specific antibodies.
In addition, there is a lot of other evidence that reminds us to be cautious about traditional symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
So, the flow chart of Zoo et al. should be updated, because they classified the person without the symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be validated in further clinical practice and studies.
As a result, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their own feedback.
For the diagnosis of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend that they track and follow the latest guidelines in their home countries.
Our team updates our guide in a timely manner to offer assistance.
Bangladesh has reported five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths caused by the virus in a single day.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of recorded infected cases includes 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
Citing details in an online news, IEDCR director Dr. Mirjidi Sabrina Flora said that the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mir Jade, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60, and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saif al-Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Defamation, who was treated at the Mitra Hospital in Kuwait.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Ubeid al-Qadir, said that under the initial plan, public transport would be closed for a long time from this coming week.
The suspension of public transport initially started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturdays on April 4.
Essential goods -- medical supplies, fuel and food -- are still allowed to be transported.
On March 8, the first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections globally.
On Thursday, data from Johns Hopkins University indicated that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection globally has exceeded one million.
About 52,000 deaths are related to COVID-19, the disease that is transmitted by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first coronavirus-related death.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few countries that is free of coronavirus infections so far.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases as of 0800 UTC Central European Time on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded in the United States, linked to 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported that, as of Wednesday, more than 1,000 Americans had died from coronavirus infection, citing data from Johns Hopkins University.
Worldwide, countries have announced tough measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that payments to Russians without work would continue until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted in favor of extending the national emergency for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favour, 10 against, and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended a full-day curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina-Manu'ra: previously, the curfew was effective from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand will impose a curfew from 10pm to 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended its stay-at-home order through May 1.
The limit of toilet paper in Australian stores has been reduced in every transaction
On Sunday and Saturday, Australian retail chains Walworth and Coils reduced the purchase restrictions on toilet tissue paper to two and one packs per transaction at all stores nationwide, respectively.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack range on Monday.
These boundaries were posted as messages on the check-outs, and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
There were reports of customers storing it in case people needed self-isolation due to the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworth also limited the purchase of toilet tissue paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
The changes follow the four-pack restrictions on each transaction previously introduced by Woolworth and Coils on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Quills, in a media release on March 8, said that with the ban on four packs in one place, "many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery", and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unprecedented".
According to a spokesperson for Woolworth, sales last week were "very strong".
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the number of permitted packs to two last week.
To reduce shortages, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery sequence, Woolworth ordered additional stock, while ADLI planned to stock on Wednesdays for special early availability.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers try to increase inventory, but the local council's restriction on delivery truck time has made it difficult.
They're also increasing production costs, because the suppliers are trying to meet demand and do something special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the stock reduction, some stores will not be able to operate on specific Wednesdays.
Dr Gary Martimer, a retail specialist at the Queensland University of Technology, said in a report for News.com.au that stores are filling up at night every day.
He said that toilet tissue paper is a big thing, which means it has a small amount of storage, and, when it's sold, it leaves a lot of shelf space empty, which creates a sense of severe scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman said on ABC News, Coles and Woolworth review [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if there's a lot of stuff like toilets and sanitation products that can be [purchased] and if there's a lot of it, maybe you can reduce the panic.
A creepy recycled toilet tissue paper manufacturer said last Wednesday it would run out of storage.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly Clark, who makes Clintons toilet tissue, and Solaris, who makes Sorbent, insisted they are working 24/7 to maintain supply.
Domain.com, a property buying and selling site, reported that some Melbourne property sellers offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions, with some auctions taking place when buyers had time due to the long weekend on International Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of the newspaper Darwin, NT News, included eight pages of inserted pages meant to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, the stores were actually reluctant to impose these restrictions, which they said they had no plans to introduce a ban on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said that demand for other products including masks, sanitary towels, dryers, hand washers and flour is also high.
Similarly, on Sunday evening, outside Australia, British supermarket shopping was observed to be limited to packs of two to 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing spread of COVID-19 - the coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 - a global pandemic.
While the term "pandemic" refers to the rapid spread of a disease, not to how dangerous a particular case is, the WHO stressed the need for action by governments".
All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic.
If countries in response detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people.
We are very concerned about both dimensions of this disease because of the speed and severity of its spread and the alarming extent of the action taken against it.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this global pandemic is "extraordinary".
He said in a February CNN commentary, "Apart from influenza, no other respiratory virus has had this kind of sequence since the onset of the pandemic".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar sentiment when he said, "We have not seen a global pandemic that started with the coronavirus".
He went on to say, "And we've never seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".
The new global pandemic status follows the announcement in January of the World Health Organization's decision to declare the pandemic a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fosse, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "The bottom line is, it is heading for further devastation".
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, the number of COVID-19 cases abroad had reached 126,000, resulting in 4,600 deaths.
The current ongoing global pandemic of 2019-20 coronavirus is a variant of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is a variant of the acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and was declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and was identified as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been cured.
China's death rate is estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.8% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, nausea, and difficulty breathing.
Complications may include symptoms of pneumonia and severe breathing difficulties.
The time from onset to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive - recommended precautions include hand-smoking, covering the face when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and private isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world have advocated travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard control and closures.
The pandemic has disrupted many global socio-economic, religious, political and cultural events and led to widespread shortages of goods due to shopping in distress.
Schools and universities in 193 countries were closed either nationally or locally, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misconceptions about the virus spread online and there were incidents of prejudice and discrimination against Chinese people, East and Southeast Asians of other races, and those who were more affected by the virus.
The slowdown in traffic and the closure of major industries has reduced air density and carbon emissions.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most of these cases were linked to the Hunan seafood wholesale market and therefore it is believed that the virus is of the animal disease lineage.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronavirus, penguin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The first person to show symptoms of the disease was diagnosed on December 1, 2019, and the person had no apparent connection to the male skull.
Two-thirds of the initial cases reported in December 2019 were related to markets.
On 13 March 2020, the South China Morning Post, in an unconfirmed report, suggested that the case of a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province on 17 November 2019 may be the first. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that while cases in China were declining, due to a sudden spike in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded new cases within China for the first time.
It may also be possible to underestimate the number of cases, especially in people with normal symptoms of the disease.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people aged 19 and under, bringing the global incidence rate to 2.4%. UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Valance estimated that 60% of the UK population would be affected before effective mass vaccination could be achieved.
According to official protocol, cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have been confirmed to be positive.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, and several countries had a government policy of not testing only those with mild symptoms, as in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases went undetected and that unregistered cases were the source of infection in 79% of registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the baseline reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people who have COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from onset to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60 years of age and 75% were in people with pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic is usually composed of those who tested positive for COVID according to official protocol.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, because these deaths do not include those who die without testing - at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic was four to five times higher than the official number of deaths from COVID.
A spokesperson for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is underreported", a statement that confirms reports of underreported deaths in the United States. Such underreporting is common during pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
The first death outside China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths have occurred in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and regions have reported deaths from every continent except the Southern Ocean. Several joint measures are used to determine deaths.
The number varies across regions and time, and is influenced by testing, the quality of the treatment system, treatment options, the time after the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The incidence and mortality ratio is obtained by dividing the number of deaths over a given period by the number of diagnosed events.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death and incidence ratio as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The number varies by region.
The incidence-to-mortality ratio (for individuals from onset of symptoms to January 1 to 10, 2020) has decreased from 17.3% to 0.7% (for individuals from onset of disease to February 1, 2020). Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with the disease who die, and the infection-to-mortality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These numbers are not for a specific time period and are for a specific population from infection to the final resolution of the case.
Several experts have tried to count this number for a specific population.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall mortality rate from infection in this global pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
This upper estimate is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 tests conducted in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the effects of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the global pandemic is manageable.
The onset and final duration of the epidemic vary and are uncertain by location.
Mackay Bonney of Penn State University said, "Unchecked, multiple outbreaks generally increase as the plateau rises and then begin to decline when the disease no longer finds hosts.
But it's impossible to make a reasonable plan right now about when it's going to happen".
"It could be over by June", insisted Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government's top medical adviser, if all countries were encouraged to follow the World Health Organization's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Charski told Adam of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably continue to circulate for one or two years".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, social distancing and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or longer)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I don't think it's likely that this coronavirus will be completely eradicated because it's so infectious", and it "will become a seasonal disease, and it will come back every year".
The death toll of the withdrawal will depend on the extent of the reduction of the African population and its variability.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively uncontrollable and people who are infected may be asymptomatic.
Two common symptoms were fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include dizziness, a sore throat (sore throat), sleeplessness, shortness of breath, joint and joint pain, a sore throat, headache, cold, nausea, bloating, diarrhea, or bluish-yellow rash. The World Health Organization reports that nearly one in four people become seriously ill and have little difficulty in breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists the following as emergency symptoms: shortness of breath, chronic chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking and bluing of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical attention is recommended - further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, body mold, blood clot, and death.
Some of these infected individuals may be asymptomatic, they may be confirmed by uncommon test results, so researchers have recommended that people who have been in close contact with confirmed patients should be closely monitored and tested to avoid infection.
China's asymptomatic disease rate is measured in a few figures to 44%.
The incubation period (median time between infection and onset of symptoms) usually ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. As an example of the uncertainty scenario, the loss of olfaction in people infected with COVID-19+ was initially 30% of those who were later reduced to 15% of those who were infected.
The exact course of the disease is still being worked out.
It is thought to be initially spread by close contact and by tiny droplets that form when coughing, sneezing, or talking; where close contact is 1 or 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) apart.
Studies have shown that a person can drop from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) without a hammer.
Some have suggested that the virus can also be spread by tiny droplets that remain in the air for too long, which are formed during speech. Breathing droplets can also be formed during exhalation, including during conversation, although the virus is not normally airborne.
These droplets can enter the mouth or nose of nearby people or possibly enter the lungs when breathing.
Certain medical procedures such as a tube infusion and a mouth-to-mouth respiration (CPR) can remove respiratory fluids and thus disperse them into the air.
It can also be spread when someone touches the affected surface and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
While there are concerns that it could spread to faces, the risk is underestimated.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through faecal secretions. The virus is highly contagious for up to three days before the onset of symptoms, although it is also possible to spread before symptoms and in the late stages of the disease.
Since people can test positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, it is believed that transmission is possible before effective symptoms appear.
The laboratory has reported only a few confirmed cases where there were no symptoms of the disease but asymptomatic transmission was revealed during investigations into the links in some countries.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease can spread, one person can typically infect two to three people - the virus can survive at varying levels for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was detectable on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, on cardboard for one day, and on copper for four hours.
However, this period varies in humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, and British authorities recommend that animals be washed after contact, as they do when touching other surfaces that have been touched by infected people.
Severe Respiratory Symptoms Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia in the severe respiratory illness group in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the corresponding physiological coronavirus - outside the human body, the virus can be eliminated with household soap, which dissolves its protective shell.
It is believed to be of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus belongs to the B family of tacoronavirus, along with the B strain of the subfamily of the two strains of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of the subfamily of subfamily of subfamily of subfamily of the subfamily of subfamily of subfamily of subfamily of subfamily of subfamily B.
At the total genome level, it is 96% similar to the other bat coronavirus specimen (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that human and penguin viruses differ only in one amino acid at a few parts of the genome sequence.
Comparisons of the complete genome to date have revealed that most 92% of the genetic material is shared in the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is enough to prove that the pangolin virus is a moderate host.
Temporary diagnosis of infection with the virus may be based on symptoms of disease, although confirmation from infected fluid or an ICT X-ray is ultimately done by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan reported that although less specific than PCR, CT is significantly more sensitive, although its imaging properties dominate the processes of other pneumonias and diseases.
Also, as of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test simultaneously uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is done on a sample of the respiratory tract or blood.
Results are usually available in a matter of hours to days.
This test is usually done with a human antibody, although throat rubbing can also be used - several laboratories and companies have developed a spurious test, which detects antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been proven to be accurate enough to be approved for mass use.
A serological test developed by CELEX in the United States has been approved for emergency use only in authorized laboratories.
The characteristics of imaging on radiography and computed tomography (CT) of those with symptoms of the disease include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opsitis and absent overflow.
The Italian Radiological Society is creating an international online database of imaging results of confirmed events.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging detection of COVID-19 without PCR validation is of limited significance.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR, which showed that although the imaging for infection is less specific, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it should be considered as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks were developed to detect the image properties of the virus, both through radiography and CT.
Strategies for preventing transmission include maintaining good overall personal hygiene, chewing hands, chewing eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and chewing and chewing tissue and dumping tissue directly in the trash.
People who are already infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Social distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission - many countries have restricted travel or avoided non-essential travel to other countries or to areas affected by the pandemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in much of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community and some people in the community don't know how or where they have been infected - healthcare providers who are suspected of being infected are advised to take standard precautions about contact and eye protection - contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to find the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
Privacy concerns have been raised by governments using mobile phone data for this purpose, with Amnesty International and 100 other organisations issuing a statement calling for this type of surveillance to be limited.
As of April 7, 2020, various mobile apps have implemented or recommended voluntary use, and more than a dozen groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to access the user's event hall from another mobile.
The user then receives a message if they have been in close proximity to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are circulating about infection prevention, such as that nasal spraying and mouthwashing are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, however several institutions are working on developing one.
It is recommended to breathe to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC often advises people to soak their hands with soap for up to 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands appear to be dry; before bathing; and when someone is cleaning, coughing, or sneezing.
That's because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap once it hits its protective shell.
The CDC further recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol by volume, when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces should also be cleaned in several ways (the stainless steel surface is exposed to a disinfectant for one minute), including 62-71 percent ethanol, 50-100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2 to 7.5 percent pavedon-iodine.
Other methods, such as benzalkonium chloride and crohexagonal gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a suspected or confirmed COVID case occurs in a location, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as offices, toilets, shared cigarettes, shared electrical equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, ATM machines, which are used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths with their curved elbows or tissue when coughing and sneezing and dispose of such tissue immediately.
Wearing surgical masks is recommended for those who may be infected, because wearing masks limits both the volume of droplets the infected person emits and the distance they can travel when they talk, sneeze and sneeze.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing masks can reduce the likelihood of people [touching] their faces, which is a major source of infection if touched without proper hand hygiene". Masks are also recommended for people who are in contact with an infected person.
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people only wear masks if there is a serious health risk, such as when they are seeing a COVID-19 patient, although it acknowledges that wearing masks prevents people from touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage people to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical fabric face masks - China specifically recommends that healthy people in the public use disposable medical masks, especially when likely to be in close proximity to other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends that surgical masks be worn when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make cloth masks at home and apply them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without wearing masks or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear face masks when going out in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has mandated that everyone must wear a mask when entering the selfies stores.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks when going out in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, also requires passengers to wear masks on trains and buses that operate between cities from April 1.
In Panama, wearing a face mask is mandatory when going out, while in homes, it is also advised to prepare masks for those who cannot afford to buy them.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes disease control actions aimed at reducing the spread of infection by limiting close contact between individuals.
These measures include quarantines, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas or shopping malls.
Individuals can implement social distancing practices by staying at home, avoiding crowds, not receiving greetings, and maintaining physical distance from each other.
Many governments are enforcing social distancing or advising in areas affected by the pandemic.
The maximum number of people recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (where the area map had no known COVID-19 cases) to 50 people, later reduced to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and a weakened immune system may face severe illness and complications, and they have been advised by the CDC to stay at home longer due to the outbreak of the epidemic in the community. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health organizations began to replace the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that it is intended to limit social contact while maintaining physical distancing, either practically or by maintaining physical distancing.
The term social distancing has led people to assume that they should be completely isolated from the world, rather than encouraged to connect with others in alternative ways. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health during the pandemic.
They also recommend that you only have sex with someone who lives with you and who has no symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who suspect they are infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed guidelines for adequate self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in an affected area.
The strictest self-quarantine guidelines have been issued for those in high-risk groups.
People who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread migration are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an epidemic include prevention, control, or suppression and mitigation.
Control strategies are developed in the early stages of an epidemic and aim to identify and isolate those affected, while introducing other infection control measures and vaccinations to prevent the disease from spreading to other populations.
When it is not possible to prevent the disease from spreading further, the first step is to enter the mitigation phase: measures are taken to reduce its spread and to reduce its impact on health care systems and society.
Prevention and mitigation measures, both should be taken jointly at the same time.
More drastic measures are needed to contain the global pandemic to bring the original outbreak rate back down to less than 1. Part of the infectious disease outbreak management is to try to reduce the outbreak's spread, which is called flattening outbreaks.
This reduces concern for health services, which are increasingly overwhelmed, and provides more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical measures that can manage the spread of the epidemic include precautions, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; social measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling mass gatherings; engaging the community to encourage people to accept and participate in such interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning up the surface - the most severe measures taken in China to contain the epidemic once it has become apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel restrictions.
Other countries have taken a number of different measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has imposed mass screening and local quarantine and issued warnings on the movement of affected people.
Singapore provided financial support to those affected who quarantined themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased production of face masks and authorized stockpiling of medical supplies. Similarities between the United Kingdom and the United States show that mitigation (reducing the spread of the epidemic but not ending it) and stress (increasing the global epidemic) are major challenges.
Excessive mitigation policies can bring the demand for health care to two-thirds of its peak and the death rate to half, but it could still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelm the health system.
Stress can be preferred as a transmission but must continue as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if earlier) or it will quickly return to health when measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to contain pandemics have been socially and economically costly.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop it, including trials on existing drugs.
Taking cold medications, drinking plenty of water, and resting may help to alleviate the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, oxygenation, intravenous injection, and respiratory assistance may be needed.
Steroid use can worsen the results.
Many compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also said that "some traditional and home remedies" can alleviate SARS-CoV-19 infections.
Increasing the capacity and adaptability of healthcare providers to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as a key step in the pandemic response.
The CDC and the World Health Organization Regional EU Office have issued guidelines for resource transition at various stages for hospitals and primary health centres, including focusing on laboratory services on COVID-19 testing capacity, responding to optional procedures where possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients and enhancing intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are many theories about where the first case started.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei began to gradually increase.
The majority of these cases are attributed to the Hunan wholesale seafood market, where live animals are also sold, and there is a theory that the virus originated from such animals; in other words, it is a strain of animal disease. A wave of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported it to Wuhan Xi'an CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about "a SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors and another, Ai Fan, was reprimanded by his superiors for spreading flattery.
Later, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
By early January, Wuhan health authorities had reported enough cases of unknown pneumonia to order an investigation. The number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days in the early stages of the outbreak.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, with transportation for Chinese New Year playing a key role as Wuhan became a major interchange for transportation and rail.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in just one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later, official data showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms of the disease. As of March 26, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases globally, overtaking China and Italy. As of April 9, 2020, there were more than 1.61 million cases reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people had died and more than 364,000 were infected.
There has been at least one case in about 200 countries and regions.
Due to this globalization in Europe, several countries in the Schengen area have restricted movement and put in place border control systems.
The national response includes containment measures such as quarantines (called stay-at-home orders, shelter orders, or lockdowns) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people in the United States, or about 90% of the population, are under some form of lockdown, more than 50 million people are under lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people in the world were under some form of lockdown, rising to 2.6 billion after a day of judo, which is almost a third of the world's population.

On 27 December 2019, preliminary genetic samples from patients were tested to indicate the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public alert on December 31.
The WHO was notified the same day.
When these reports were received, the police in Wuhan warned doctors about "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that this was not "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched an extremist campaign that Communist Party of China Secretary General Xi Jinping later dubbed "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
Described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a sweeping clean-up campaign was announced on January 23 that banned travel from Wuhan, extending to 15 cities in Hubei, and affecting a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Then another hospital, the Leishanshan Hospital, was built to take care of the extra patients.
In addition to newly constructed hospitals, China also converted 14 other buildings in Wuhan into temporary hospitals, such as convention centers and stadiums. On January 26, the government took further measures to control the spread of COVID-19, including issuing health notices for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holidays.
Universities and schools abroad were also closed.
Hong Kong and Macau regions have also taken several initiatives, especially with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work has been introduced in many areas of China.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and out of Hubei.
Public transportation was changed and museums were temporarily closed across China.
Several cities imposed restrictions on public movement, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) were subjected to some form of restrictions outside their homes. When the pandemic spread globally in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from foreign countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all international travellers arriving in the city. On March 23, there was only one case of local transmission in central China, which occurred in a traveller arriving in Guangzhou from Istanbul five days earlier.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the path of local transmission incidents had been essentially closed and the epidemic in China was under control.
On the same day, two months after the implementation of the lockdown, travel restrictions in Hubei were eased in addition to Wuhan, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on March 26, 2020 that applications for visas and residence permits would be suspended from March 28, and no final date was given for the end of the policy.
People who want to enter China must apply to the Chinese embassy or consulate for visas.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to open on March 30 and provided financial incentives to companies. The State Council announced a day of mourning that will begin at 10:00 am on April 4 with a three-minute silence across the country, coinciding with the Qinzheng celebration, although the central government has asked all families to show their respect online in the face of physical distancing to prevent the re-spread of COVID-19.
The transmission of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed on 20 January 2020.
The National Health Agency reported a number of confirmed cases of rape on February 20, mostly related to a new religious movement called Shinchongi Church of the Jews in Daegu.
Shenchongzi's followers from Wuhan who traveled to Daegu were suspected of being the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 of the church's 9,336 followers, or about 13%, had reported symptoms. South Korea declared its highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers were confirmed to have the virus.
The airline's schedule was also affected, so they had to change. South Korea introduced the largest and best-managed donation program to monitor the virus in the population, and to isolate those who had been infected, as well as to track and quarantine those who had come into contact with them.
The screening process includes testing international travellers through mobile applications, by having the virus tested in the car with results coming out the next day, mandatory self-reporting of disease symptoms, and the ability to test 20,000 people a day.
South Korea's outbreak containment program is considered a success despite not quarantining all cities. South Korean society was initially critical of President Moon Jae-in's response to the outbreak.
Several Koreans have signed petitions either praising Moon's response to the pandemic or impeaching him for the government's, they claim, inadequate response to the pandemic.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had its lowest total daily cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that all foreign travellers arriving from April 1 would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports, on April 1, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries for cooperation in testing for the virus.

Iran allocated five billion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on 26 February 2020 that there are no plans to quarantine affected areas and only individuals will be quarantined.
In March, travel between cities was announced to be restricted, although vehicles continued to run until before the celebration of Navruz.
Shiite shrines remained in Qom until 16 March 2020. Iran became the center of the virus after China in February.
Amid accusations of Iran covering up the extent of the outbreak, the source of their cases in ten countries as of February 28 was linked to Iran, indicating that the outbreak would be much higher than the 388 cases the Iranian government had reported to date.
The Iranian parliament was shut down after 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful dissent and to temporarily release all prisoners.
It noted that closed institutions such as detention centers are at higher risk of spreading the virus because they also lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest number of deaths in one day since the outbreak.
As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials have died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran had 50 new cases every hour and one death from coronavirus every 10 minutes.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times as many cases as reported in Iran.
It was also suggested that US sanctions on Iran could affect the country's financial capacity against the viral spread.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for easing economic sanctions on countries severely affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The spread of the pandemic to Italy was confirmed on 31 January when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
The cases began to rise rapidly, forcing the Italian government to cancel all flights from China and to impose a state of emergency in the country.
An unrelated cluster of COVID-19 infections was later detected, with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February - a new legal order to contain the disease was announced by the Council of Ministers on 22 February, which included quarantining 50,000 people in 11 different cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Guiuspi Conti said "it will be a stopover to travel to the outbreak areas".

As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, most of them in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report suggested that Italy's high mortality rate may be due to an aging population and the inability to test all those infected with the virus to date.
The UK's initial response to the virus was the most relaxed of all the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government has not imposed any social distancing or total quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has been criticized for its slow response to the public's difficulties and for underestimating its severity. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising people to avoid all unnecessary travel and social contact, and suggested working from home as much as possible and avoiding places such as bars, restaurants and cinemas.
On 20 March, the government announced that all entertainment venues such as pubs and gyms would be closed as soon as possible and promised to pay 80% of workers who were paid up to £2,500 a month to reduce unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced strict social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people, restricting travel and banning activities outside the home except for essential activities.
Unlike previous measures, these measures were implemented by the police in a manner that imposed fines and forcibly dispersed crowds.
Most businesses were ordered to close, but those that were declared "essential" were exempted including supermarket chains, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and car warehouses.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control - the leading agency for health in the US government - announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Despite this, the United States began testing slowly, which obscured the true extent of the pandemic at the time.
The testing capacity was damaged by the poor test kits that the central government created in February, a failure by the central government to approve non-governmental test kits (experts, companies and hospitals) by the end of February, and the restriction criteria (i.e. a doctor's order was required afterwards) for people to qualify for a test by early March.
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been performed in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been performed.

May also shipped medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concerns about Chinese-made masks and test kits.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus test kits with an accuracy ratio of only 30%, while the Netherlands returned 600,000 Chinese masks that were damaged.
Belgium returned 100,000 unused masks, thought to be from China, but they were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, China's aid was welcomed in Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched an emergency assistance operation for developing countries.
WHO praised the efforts of Chinese authorities to contain and manage the pandemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic, where Chinese authorities were accused of covering up the matter which disrupted prevention and control efforts, and the current crisis where the central government has "provided regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays".
In response to the decision by central authorities to impose a travel ban in Wuhan on January 23, WHO spokesperson Gaudin Galia said that while there was "no recommendation from the WHO" about it, he added that "it was an important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it has spread most", calling it an "unusual event in the history of public health". After the confirmation of human-to-human transmission of the disease outside China on January 30, and due to the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the epidemic a Public Health Emergency of Concern (PHEIC), a variant of the 2009 PHEIC that began during the global influenza pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was "a global pandemic risk, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems".
Responding to the travel restrictions, Tedros said that "there is no need for measures that unduly interfere with global travel and trade" and that the World Health Organization advises "restricted trade and movement".
On February 5, the World Health Organization appealed to the international community for $675 million to help low-income countries develop strategies for the pandemic, citing the need for emergency aid to countries that do not have systems in place to track people who are infected with the virus, even if it spreads".
Tedros further stated that "we are only as strong as our connections are weak" and urged the global community to invest today or pay more later". On February 11, the World Health Organization held a press conference on COVID-19, as the disease is called.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had agreed to use "the power of the entire UN system" to respond to the pandemic.
As a result, a UN Crisis Group was activated, which was allowed to coordinate all UN responses, which according to the WHO, would allow them to focus on health responses while other agencies could provide their expert opinions on the social, economic and development factors of the pandemic at large.
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO was activated with China to assist international and WHO experts in domestic organization on the Chinese mainland and to assess "the severity and transmission of the disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions and "touring these areas to assess the impact of response activities at the provincial and district level, including urban and rural areas". On 25 February, the World Health Organization announced that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", saying that although it would still be too early to call the disease an epidemic, countries should still be in the "preparatory phase".
In light of the growing epidemic in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission to Tehran to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said the global coronavirus risk would be increased from "high" to "extremely high", the highest level of risk identification and alert.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Emergency Plan, warned in a statement that "this is the place for every government on the planet to really think: Wake up.
The virus may be on the way and you need to be prepared", stressing that the right response can help save the world from "its worst".
Ryan added that current data does not allow public health officials to declare the disease a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean "we fundamentally recognize that every human being on the planet will be exposed to this virus".
On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic.
The Director-General said the WHO was "deeply concerned at both the dangerous level of spread and severity of the disease and the lack of adequate response" - the WHO has faced considerable criticism for its apparent inadequate response to the global pandemic, including the delayed declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a global pandemic.
The response included a petition to resign WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, which had 733,000 signatures as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts called for respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts said that everyone has the right to intervene to save lives and the government has the responsibility.
The group stressed that there should be no justification for discrimination against any one group on the basis of lack of resources or health insurance.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including people with disabilities, people belonging to minority groups, older people, internally displaced persons, homeless people, people living in extreme poverty, people in correctional facilities, and also refugees and other non-essential groups eligible for government assistance.
International governments are addressing the economic and social drivers of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as comments and advice.
From strengthening health systems and the global economy through policies to mitigating the impact of lockdowns and travel restrictions, this digital hub includes a country policy tracker, and aims to enable all countries to learn from each other and contribute to a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized for its handling of the global pandemic, which started in the Chinese province of Hubei, by the United States, the United Kingdom's Cabinet Secretary Michael Guava, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Edward Bocelli.
Several provincial organizers of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were removed from their posts for dealing with quarantine measures in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political institutions in those regions to the epidemic.
Some commentators believe that the move may be to protect the Communist Party of China's General Secretary Xi Jinping from public outcry over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected earlier admissions of a coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories of COVID-19 originating in the United States or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that China's censorship made a virus so powerful that it has now become a global pandemic, which was criticized by some critics in response as a pretext for bias and "a distraction from administrative negligence in disease prevention".
The Best newspaper received a cable from the US government in which a letter, apparently in conversation with a person from the National Security Council, discussed the wisdom of Ali that "it's all about China".
We are told that this message should be conveyed in every possible way, including press conferences and television. Channels such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's aid deliveries to the virus-afflicted countries are merely propaganda for apparent global influence.
The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, warned that there is a "geopolitical element, including the spin for influence and 'politics of generosity.'"
Borel also said that "China is pushing a strong message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China has also demanded that the US lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while the latter has reportedly sent aid to the two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by the United States on April 3.
US officials were also accused of diverting aid to other countries.
And there are also problems with masks among other countries, like Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of ventilators exported to Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of solidarity with Italy during the coronavirus.
Italy's ambassador to the EU, Maurizio Massari, said: "Only China has reacted correctly bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of EU solidarity.'
On March 22, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military medical supplies, special disinfectant vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa, citing an unnamed "high-level political source", reported that 80% of Russian aid was "useless or not of use to Italy".
Zaya accused Russia of "geopolitical and diplomatic" aggression.
Lombardy's President Ittilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media reports and thanked them.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "while providing support to American colleagues, [Putin] believes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials catch up, they will be able to make bilateral payments when needed".
The proposed NATO military exercises in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, "Master 2020", will be the largest NATO war games since the Cold War, and will be held on a smaller scale.
Kate Hudson, Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticized the Safeguard 2020 exercises: "In the current health crisis, it puts at risk not only the lives of the US military and many European countries, but also the lives of the residents of the countries where it will be held". The Iranian government is heavily affected by the virus, with some two dozen MPs as well as fifteen current or former political figures having been affected.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020, asking for help, saying his country is struggling to fight the pandemic due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The pandemic has warned the US to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including universal health care, universal childcare, increased family pay, and overfunding for public health.
Political analysts predict this will have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have been strained by the global pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "impractical and ineffective quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that it would quarantine people arriving from South Korea at a government-designated place for two weeks.
Initially, South Korean society was unilaterally critical of President Moon Jae-in's response to the virus crisis.
Several Koreans have signed petitions either praising Moon's response to the pandemic or indicting the government for what they claim is an inadequate response to the pandemic.
Some observers have expressed concern that it could allow the government to consolidate its grip on power.
In Hungary, parliament authorized Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections, and punish those who spread misinformation about the government's response to the virus and the crisis.
Coronavirus was blamed for food shortages, which were caused by increased global use of epidemic prevention supplies, panic buying and disruption of factory and logistics processes.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical supplies that were triggered by rising consumer demand and disruption to supply.
Shopping in Gujarat was seen in many areas, which led to empty closets of essential items such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, leading to shortages.
The technology industry in particular issued a warning of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to a twentyfold increase in the normal price and a delay in delivery of medical supplies of four to six months.
This has also led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, which the WHO has warned could put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has given Digo shoppers a new opportunity to sell Australian products in China.
These activities led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets, which was immediately banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the growing demand for food items, both areas have avoided severe food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against the stockpiling and illicit trade of essential commodities have been successful, as they have prevented the severe food shortages expected in North America and Europe.
Northern Italy, which is very important for agricultural production, has not seen any significant decline in production, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Food shelves have been temporarily opened, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials have released pork stockpiles to ensure an abundant food supply to the population.
A similar law exists in Italy, where food manufacturers are required to store food for emergencies.
The damage to the global economy has been felt in China: According to a media report dated March 16, the Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to contain the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub, this viral outbreak is being seen as a major threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demaris of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that until a clear picture of the possible outcomes emerges, markets will remain volatile.
In January 2020, some analysts speculated that the economic impact of the pandemic on global growth could overtake the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated a $300 billion impact on the global supply chain that could last for two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) dissolved "presumably" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to very low demand from China.
Global stock markets tumbled on February 24 after a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, amid growing concerns about the coronavirus, several U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, saw their fastest decline since 2008, with the Dow dropping 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three indices saw a fall of more than 10% over the weekend.
On February 28, Scoop Rating GmbH confirmed China's self-assessed credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The coronavirus scare caused the stock markets to fall again, the biggest fall occurring on March 16.
Many people believe that a recession is possible.
Economist Mohamed El Ereen praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are responding more quickly than they did in the 2008 financial crash.
Tourism is one of the most affected by travel restrictions, closures of public places including tourist centers, and travel restrictions by governments globally.
As a result, several airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas cancelled flights due to low demand, while British flag carrier Flyby also crashed from the rooftops.
The impact on the maritime tourism industry was unprecedented.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The outbreak came at the same time as the Chong'an, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holidays.
Several events, which were expected to draw large crowds, were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year celebration, in which the state-owned companies even closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several Lunar Year events and tourist attractions, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional dome fairs, were closed to avoid crowds.
Municipal and regional officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces extended New Year's holidays until February 10, and instructed most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong reached the highest level of response to the pandemic and declared a state of emergency, which closed schools until March and cancelled New Year celebrations. The global retail sector was affected by the shortening of store hours or temporary closure.
Access to retail stores in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% drop.
This reduced the number of pedestrians to shopping centres in March by 33-43% compared to February.
The world's mall operators have implemented additional measures, such as extra cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the global pandemic-induced recession could have pushed 14 to 22 million more people into extreme poverty in Latin America than they would have been without a global pandemic.
In January and February 2020, when the epidemic was at its peak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China had lost their jobs.
About 300 million rural migrants in China were trapped in homes in remote areas of the provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans became unemployed and applied for government assistance.
An estimate by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis suggests that the coronavirus disease could cost 47 million in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. Millions of federal workers (daily wage earners) have been laid off in India since the lockdown. A survey by the Angus Reader Institute found that 44% of household Canadians have become unemployed in some way.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for the Universal Credit Scheme. In Germany, almost half a million companies paid their workers a premium on a government-backed short-term work scheme called the Corserbit.
Germany's short-term work compensation scheme has also been adopted by France and the United Kingdom.
The arts and heritage sectors globally have been hit hard by the pandemic, which has also affected the operations of institutions and individuals, including both employment and self-employment.
The arts and culture sector organizations tried to maintain their mission (which is often publicly supported) to provide access to cultural heritage to society, to maintain the protection of their employees and the public, and to support artists where possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, art venues and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events and programs were cancelled or postponed.
In response, considerable efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and most rapid failure of the pandemic is the cancellation of religious services, key events in Kahil and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a setback. The Vatican announced that Holy Week in Rome, which falls on the last week of the Christian Lent season, had been canceled.
Many pastors advised elderly Christians to stay at home instead of attending Sunday worship; some churches began broadcasting church services over the radio, live TV, or online while others were sitting in their cars.
As the Roman Catholic clergy of Rome closed their churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square became empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious institutions also stopped their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, convents, temples, and churches.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the pandemic and closed shrines, while Saudi Arabia closed the entry of foreign pilgrims and similarly closed the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic, since World War II, has significantly disrupted the world's sports calendar.
The most important major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the activity "will be rescheduled for a date beyond 2020 but not held after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other sports venues have been closed and live poker tournaments postponed or canceled.
This has led to a surge in online gambling, and a significant increase in new signups to many online gambling sites. The entertainment industry has also been hit hard, with many music groups postponing or cancelling their concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as those on Broadway, have also suspended all performances.
Many artists have found ways to work online as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming events, and to communicate, or to create web-based "fairs" where artists can perform, spread, and promote their work.
Online, many memes based on the coronavirus idea have spread as many turn to humor and distraction in this uncertain situation.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, Chinese and East Asian people, Europe, the United States and other countries where the epidemic has intensified, have seen a lot of prejudice, xenophobia, fear of strangers and racism.
There have been cases of fear, suspicion and opposition, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
According to February reports (while most cases were confined to China), Chinese people have been subjected to racist sentiments in various groups around the world that deserve the virus to be justified in return.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has also been seen in some African countries.
Many residents in Wuhan and Hubei reported being treated differently on a regional basis.
For the Chinese, both online and offline, and those in the affected areas, support has been provided.
After the outbreak and spread to other countries, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a COVID-19 outbreak, may be suspicious and fearful of strangers. In an effort to contain the disease, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed petitions seeking to ban Chinese people from entering their countries.
The hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become a trending topic on Twitter in Japan.
Chinese people, as well as other Asian residents in the UK and US, have reported incidents of racism-based abuse and humiliation.
US President Donald Trump has faced heavy criticism for calling the coronavirus "Chinese virus", with critics calling the term racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying evacuees from Ukraine and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sad.
Students coming from northern India, which borders China, and studying in major cities in India have faced the shock of being harassed over the spread of coronavirus.
Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal state unit president Dilip Ghosh stated that China has destroyed nature and "that is why God has taken revenge on them".
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese ambassador in Calcutta, calling it "misleading". In China, since the pandemic, the fear of strangers has been fueled by racist sentiments towards non-Chinese residents, with foreigners being called "foreign trash" to be "picked up".
Many paywall newspapers have removed them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many publishers of scientific material have made scientific papers about the outbreak available to the public.
Many scientists quickly sent their results to servers, like bioRixiv, before publishing them.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that produce antibodies as a result of infection.
RT-PCR samples confirm the presence of the virus, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm a very recent or active infection.
Antibodies (seriology) can also be used to diagnose and monitor the population.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including those with symptoms too minor to report or who showed no symptoms.
The results of these tests can be used to determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity present in a population.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has documented data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is also a large variation in how much testing is done between countries.
This variation has led to a large discrepancy in the reported death rates, which is likely to be higher than estimated in some countries.
Tests on breath samples using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) can be obtained in a variety of ways, including nasopharyngeal mucus or stool samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The PT-PCR test performed on the throat is reliable only in the first week of illness.
Later, when it starts to grow in the lungs, the virus disappears in the throat.
For infected individuals to be tested in the second week, alternatively, the sample material may be used from the deep airways via a suction catheter or cough-up material (throat).
The first PCR tests were developed at the Charity site in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) which formed the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the UK had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
It detects the "E" gene that is spread by the Bta coronavirus, and the RdRp gene is specific to SARS-CoV-2. BGI Group in China was among the first companies to receive emergency use approval of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit from China's National Medical Products Administration. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to public health laboratories through the International Regent Resource.
One in three tests in the older version of Test Kitten failed due to poor chemical interactions, and testing at the CDC in Atlanta was hampered by less than 100 samples per day during February 2020.
As of February 28, 2020, two-component tests were not considered reliable, and this was until state and local laboratories were allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. US business laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
LabCorp also announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 across the country as of 5th March 2020.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics has also made COVID-19 testing available nationwide as of 9th March 2020.
Quantity limits were not announced; collection of samples and further processing must be in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was designed and developed by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reported that it had developed a test for detecting COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the test, which could be performed in large numbers in 3.5 hours, meaning that a machine could perform approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abott Laboratories on Abott's m2000 system; the FDA previously granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp and Themo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid similarly obtained EUA from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because it doesn't require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method allows positive results to be obtained in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott expects to increase the number of these machines to 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses monoclonal antibodies specifically restricted to the nucleopeptide protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to a rapid influenza test.
A review of the written material in March 2020 concluded that "no significance of chest radiography assessment at the initial stage, however the presence of [CT computed tomography] before symptoms appear is possible".
Common features of CT are two-way multi-lobed ground glass blurring including asymmetric and backward-dividing envelope.
It grows as the disease, complete dominance, crazy smooth and stable development.
In Wuhan, where the pandemic first originated, a study comparing PCR and CT suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its features similar to pneumonia and disease stages.
Also as of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as the first priority for diagnosis of COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
Immunity to infection including IgM and IgG partial response to antibodies.
They can be used to detect infection in people who have had symptoms for seven days, to determine immunity, and for people who are under close surveillance. Testing can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or a security testing center (PoCT).
Many clinical laboratories will have high-yield automated systems capable of these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
A single blood sample is usually used for CLT, although multiple samples can be used to detect immunity.
For PoCT, a blood sample is usually obtained by drilling through the skin.
Unlike PCR procedures, no prior testing of the emission is required.On March 26, 2020, the FDA listed 29 entities that provide notification to the agency and are therefore now able to distribute their own antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples in a few hours, so it's faster than traditional PCR for detecting RNA viruses.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection begins. In early April, the UK found that none of the test kits purchased were sufficiently valid for use.
Hong Kong has introduced a scheme whereby suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", they will spit in it, return it and get the result shortly after. The UK NHS has announced that it is launching a scheme on an experimental basis to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of the patient passing the infection to others or if they are taken to hospital.
South Korea has more tests than any other country, faster and more, thanks to drive-through centers. The National Association of State Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that it has a capacity to do 12,000 tests per day in normal settings and will do 10,700 tests last week.
When the physician says test, the cost is covered by the health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to test 160,000 per week.
Drive-in tests were also offered in several major cities by March 19.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests performed in Germany was not known, as only positive results are reported.
According to the first lab survey, 483,295 samples were tested by calendar week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) came back positive for 2-SARS-CoV this week. Researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and adopted a procedure to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, in which all samples are collected and only further tested if the sample turns positive. A temporary laboratory with an emergency detection capacity of 2,000 square meters called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English) was set up in Wuhan, which was launched by the BGI on 5 February 2020 with a capacity of more than 10,000 days of sampling.
{NS} What is it?
The Wuhan lab's method was quickly adopted by the Hu-Yin laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Shanghai, thus a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, the capacity of 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays has released an open-source multi-element design that can test 1,122 COVID-19 patients with just 93 attempts. These balanced designs can be deployed in small laboratories without a robotic fluid handler.
As of March, shortages and inadequate quantities of the reagent have become an obstacle to mass testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has led some authors to investigate the protocol for sample preparation that heats samples to 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes or chromosomes for further testing. As announced on 31 March, the UAE is now testing more of its population for coronavirus than any other country, and is working on plans to reach its entire population.
Such drive-through capability and benefits from both Grooup 42 and BGI (based on their "HUO-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China) developed for large populations.
The lab, which was set up in 14 days, performed 1000 high-throughput RT-PCR tests per day, making it the first lab outside China to operate on such a large scale.
Various testing techniques were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States to target different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
The WHO used the German recipe for low-income countries, which don't have the resources to make the kit.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020, and protocols made in the United States to control the disease were not available until January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the United States due to concerns over the quality of test kits in China and the United States in the early days of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide the kits despite recommendations and demand from health experts.
In contrast, experts say that South Korea's large supply of testing has reduced the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has been boosting testing capacity in private sector laboratories over the past few years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization urged strengthening testing programs to slow the spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The virus's massive spread led to increased testing demand and tens of millions of tests stalled in U.S. private laboratories, and pressures on the supply of wound cleansing soaps and chemical interactions.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the validity of its test kits.
In the US, the CDC developed kits that were "defective", and the government then removed the official barriers that prevented private testing. Spain purchased kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be incorrect.
The firm explained that the incorrect results were due to errors in the collection of samples or incorrect use of the cuts.
The Spanish ministry said that the kits giving false results would be removed and replaced with testing kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the kits purchased from China by the Czech state gave false results. 1.2 million test kits purchased from China by Slovakia did not come out correct.
Prime Minister Matovik suggested that they be dumped in the Danube. Ataskara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the kits that Turkey purchased from China had a "very high error rate" and were "not put into use". The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
Efforts to identify individuals who were quarantined and those who were in contact with SARS-CoV-2 patients in case of testing positive showed positive results.
In the Italian town of Vo, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, researchers working with the entire population, which was about 3,400 people, were tested twice for at least 10 days.
Almost half of the people tested had no symptoms, and all of the detected cases were quarantined.
Restricting travel to specific human groups led to the complete elimination of new infections.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic, thanks to extensive contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, had far less impact on Singapore than developed countries around the world, where there were no strict restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retailers.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising citizens to stay at home on March 28, but reopened schools in time for the holidays on March 23.
Many other countries have already contained the pandemic through strict measures such as contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but not more stringent lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
One statistic shows that countries that have more tests, in terms of death rates, have lower death rates, probably because they are able to detect people with little or no symptoms.
WHO recommended that countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories to handle COVID-19 send their first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of these 16 reference labs, seven are in Asia, five are in Europe, two are in Africa, one is in North America, and one is in Australia.
The column "% of positive tests" in the chart below relates to a country's testing policy.
A country that only tests hospitalized patients will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests all its citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, will take everyone equally.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning one's hands of dirt, grease, germs, or other unnecessary substances.
Washing hands with soap several times a day on certain "necessary occasions" prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and the germs from the menstrual cycle entering the mouth.
People can also get respiratory diseases such as influenza or whooping cough, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five essential times of the day when washing hands with soap is essential: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating and preparing food, and after touching raw meat, fish, or chicken.
If soap and water are not available, washing hands with ash is also recommended. The World Health Organization recommends the following:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after the patient's diagnosis.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child's toilet.
After forcefully cleaning your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food or animal waste.
Medical hygiene refers to the practice of medical procedures in accordance with hygienic principles.
Washing hands or taking medical care before taking medication can stop or reduce the spread of disease.
The main purpose of medical handwashing is to keep hands free of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that cause disease) and chemicals that can damage or spread disease.
This is especially true for people in the food or medical fields, but it's also a good habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many medical benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the causes of diarrheal disease; reducing respiratory infections;
And the mortality rate of the children born at home is going to be lower.
A 2013 study found that improving hand-washing habits slightly improved the height of children under five.
In developing countries, simple changes in habits can reduce infant deaths from respiratory and diarrheal diseases, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple process can reduce deaths from these diseases by up to 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce diarrhea deaths by a third, and that's comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Diarrhoea death rates can be reduced by up to 48% by handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive means of preventing diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). It is an automated practice that can be practiced in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
In children under five, pneumonia, a major ARI, is the leading cause of death, claiming the lives of about 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia both cause the deaths of about 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, a natural change to hand washing before and after meals could save more lives than the use of a vaccine or medical intervention, i.e. halving deaths from diarrhea and a quarter reducing deaths from severe respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually part of other hygiene activities, such as water, sewage and sanitation (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against diseases that are directly transmitted by the urine.
One minor disadvantage of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin by drying it out.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy skin, or inflammation of the skin, which is common among medical professionals.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times in a day when hand washing with soap is essential to reduce the spread of disease through faeces and mouth: after using the bathroom (urination or cooking), after cleaning the baby's bottom (diaper change), before feeding the baby, before and after eating, and before and after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish, or chicken.
Other times when hands should be washed properly to prevent transmission include: before and after handling a wound; after sneezing, coughing, or cleaning the nose; after handling animal waste or animal waste; and after touching garbage.
Many countries have low rates of hand washing with soap.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%, the United States was in the middle at 77%, and China had the lowest rate at 23%. Many behaviors change current practices to increase hand washing with soap at critical times.
The mandatory "Health Security Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a massive promotion of children's health and education.
The national program includes pest control twice a year, daily hand washing with soap, daily fluoride tooth brushing.
It has also been successfully applied in Indonesia.
The process of skin disinfection has been improved by adding soap and detergents to the water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the dissolving barrier and increase the solubility.
Water alone is not enough to cleanse the skin because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not dissolve easily in water.
Cleaning, however, is aided by proper water flow.
Soap solids, when reused, can have bacteria from past use.
Some studies that have studied bacterial transmission from solid contaminated soap say that this cannot be the case because the bacteria are released with the foam.
The CDC still says "liquid soap without hand control is a good choice".
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted among health-conscious public.
There is no evidence yet that using recommended disinfectants produces antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which is resistant to organic organisms.
So if antibacterial soaps don't choose antibiotic resistance, they won't be as effective as they're said to be.
In addition to moisturizers and skin protectors, the more refined formulas may contain benzoic acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, and skin conditioner (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant ethers). A detailed analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that simple soaps are as effective for consumers as antibacterial soaps that contain triclosan, which protects from diseases and removes bacteria from the hands.
The hot water that I'm comfortable with isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow more rapidly at body temperature (37°C).
However, semi-heated, soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water at removing natural oils, which absorb soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that semi-heated water is not effective in decontaminating hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand sanitizer.
In the 1990s and early 21st century, water-free alcohol-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectant hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol which is mixed in a thick agent, such as Carbomer (a polysaccharide of multiple acids) in a jelly-like substance or in a moist substance such as glycerin in a liquid or foamed for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
Adding oxide to the dissolved hydrogen increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of 60 to 95% are effective disinfectants.
Alcoholic sanitizers kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhino viruses, vaccinia, influenza, hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcoholic sanitizers with 70% alcohol (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibels reduction) kill 99.97% of bacteria 30 seconds after use and 99.99 to 99.999% (a reduction of 4 to 5 logs) after 1 minute of use. Hand sanitizers are very effective for bacteria and less effective for a few other viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective for Norwalk, the most common cause of infectious small intestinal infections. Disinfectant or alcohol-containing materials should be used extensively on both hands.
The front and back of both hands and the middle and back of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until the material, foam or gel is dry.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand-washing with a chest-sniffing device, especially if the hands are visibly contaminated.
The reason for the rapid use of such materials is their ease of use and ability to kill germs quickly; however, they should not be considered as an alternative to formal hand washing, and should be used when soap and water are not available.
Excessive use of alcohol-based sanitizers can cause rapid drying, unless cream and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
Glycerin and/or other creams may be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying effect of the alcohol.
Clinical trials have shown that alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing creams reduce skin irritation and dryness compared to soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergies can sometimes be caused by early illness or by excessive sensitivity to alcohol or to the addition of intoxicating substances to alcohol.
It is preferred over hand washing with soap and water because it is less prone to burning and more prone to diseases.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents cannot purify organic matter, they only disinfect it.
That's why many hand sanitizers are less effective than soap and water at controlling the spread of germs, because germs live on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends largely on ingredients and composition, and historically they have not been very effective.
Recent formulations that have used benzyl chloride, unlike alcohol, have seen overall antimicrobial activity after use, and after repeated use, perhaps due to a skin reaction, its effectiveness has decreased.
In many low-income societies, people cannot afford to buy soap and instead use ashes or clay.
Ash and soil may be more efficient than just water, but less than soap.
There is a risk that if soil or ash is contaminated by germs, it may increase the risk of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes into contact with water.
WHO recommends ash or soil if soap is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended proper handwashing practices to prevent the spread of disease include:
Wet your hands with running, semi-hot or cold water.
Flowing water is recommended because standing water can be polluted, whereas water temperature doesn't matter.
Rub your hands with a reasonable amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the middle of your fingers, and the bottom of your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research has shown that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of just water.
Meet for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing together creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin faster, and rubbing for longer periods of time removes more germs.
Clean thoroughly with running water.
Washing your hands in a sink can re-contaminate them.
Clean with a dry towel or let air dry.
Wet and damp hands can easily become re-contaminated. Commonly left untouched areas include the fingers, wrists, the space between the toes, and the edges of the nails.
Artificial nails and semi-abrasive nail polishes can be a hotbed for germs.
Moisturizing lotions are commonly prescribed to protect hands from dryness; dry skin can damage the skin, increasing the risk of infection transmission.
If tap water and/or soap are not available, many low-cost facilities can be provided, such as draining water from a hanging canister or a loci-shaped vegetable with suitable holes, and/or using ash when needed in developing countries. In situations where water supply is scarce (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-taps" or other low-cost methods.
Tippy-tap is a simple technique that consists of a jug that is hung from a rope and a leg-moving lever that drips a small amount of water on the hands and a soap pad.
Effective hand drying is part of hand hygiene, but there is debate about what is the most effective way to dry in public toilets.
Most studies suggest that paper towels are better than electric dryers, which are often found in latrines.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium, which included paper towels, hot air hand dryers and modern jet air-hinned dryers, on the hygiene standards of the industry.
After washing and drying with a hot air dryer, the bacteria rate on the fingertips increased by an average of 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Jet air dryer drying resulted in a 42% increase in bacteria on the fingertips and a 15% increase on the palms.
After washing hands and drying them with tissue paper, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips decreased by an average of 76 percent and on the palms by 77 percent. Scientists also tested whether each type of drying process had the potential to spread contamination to other washroom users and the environment.
The jet air dryer, which discharges air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing germs from hands and the unit and can contaminate other users of the toilet and the environment of the toilet up to a distance of 2 meters.
A hot-air hand dryer can spread germs up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
No specific germs spread from the tissue. A 2005 study by TUV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria occurred after hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and they've been compared to paper towels.
In the absence of soap and water, hand washing with sandpaper is an alternative during travel.
Alcohol-based sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing has been a medical requirement since Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its efficacy in hospital settings (1846).
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to hospital staff to remind them to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that their use reduced the rate of infection.
Clinical hand washing is for at least 15 seconds, using a specific amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hand.
Rub the fingers together.
If there is any mildew in the fingernails, a hard-haired brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can linger in the water on your hands, it is important to wash them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, a paper towel should be used to close the water (and, if necessary, to open the back door).
It will not contaminate your hands again after touching these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare settings is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that even in medical settings, handwashing rates are unacceptably low, with a large number of doctors and nurses who normally forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus becoming a source of germ transmission.
One study found that proper handwashing and other simple practices reduce the rate of urinary tract infections by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a paper outlining the proper way to wash and shake hands in the health sector.
The agency's draft hand hygiene guidelines can be viewed on their website for public comment.
A related review was done by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can test and validate hand hygiene, if this is mandatory.
The World Health Organization has identified "five reasons" for hand washing:
When exposed to blood/body moisture
Before the sterilization, and
After the patient is taken care of, the hand washing agent is given the task of disinfecting the soap with the addition of a disinfectant chemical.
This is especially true where antibiotic-resistant bacteria are present before surgery or where the need for sterilization is high. To "rub" your hands for surgery, you need a tap that can be opened and closed without touching, washed with chlorhexidine or iodine, a disinfected towel to dry your hands after washing, a disinfected brush for rubbing, and a second disinfecting tool for cleaning your fingernails.
Remove all the jewelry.
This involves washing hands from wrist to elbow, usually for 6 to 2 minutes.
Long-term rubbing (10 minutes) is not required.
When the water is poured over the middle of the arm, care should be taken not to allow it to return to the hands.
When the hand washing is complete, the hands are dried with a disinfected cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands before and after seeing a patient or apply hand sanitizer.
In controlling staphylococcal infections in hospitals, research has found that the greatest benefits of hand hygiene came from the first 20% washing, and that when this rate was increased to 35%, there was little additional benefit.
The use of plain soap was three times more effective than antibacterial soap in the transmission of bacterial infectious disease into the diet. Comparing alcohol-based solution and antibacterial soap to 30 seconds of hand rubbing each, it was found that alcohol-based hand rubbing reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based solutions at removing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from hands. If hand hygiene is improved in healthcare settings, it will require staff training for hand washing, availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and written and verbal reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine which measures are most effective in different health settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered a cheap way to get better health, and even better nutrition.
However, the lack of a steady supply of water, soap and handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes the adoption of universal handwashing a major challenge.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, it is very rare to have a hand washing faucet near a private or public toilet, although many low-cost ways of building hand washing facilities are possible.
However, the decline in hand washing rates may also be due to the maturation of the habit rather than the lack of soap and water.
Soap-based handwashing promotion and advertising can influence decision-making, raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing, and create far-reaching changes in population behavior.
Monitoring and testing are essential to make this work.
A formal study of 70 students found that working in a particular community in LMICs is more effective, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One way to promote hand washing in schools is the "three-star approach" by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and low-cost measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap in addition to other hygiene principles.
When they reach the minimum standards, schools can reach second and then third stars.
The creation of handwashing facilities could be part of a handwashing campaign, which aims to reduce childhood disease and death.
World Handwashing Day is the second example of this awareness campaign, which aims to change behaviour. In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of handwashing emoji.
Some studies have found handwashing to be less costly overall, ignoring DALYs in developing countries.
However, one study found that it is much cheaper to promote handwashing with soap than with water and sanitation.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for those in vulnerable situations, such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in the hospital - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two of the world's leading hygienists: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, who is "the founder of modern nursing".
At the time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by a bad odor.
In 1980, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention further promoted hand hygiene as a key means of preventing the spread of infection due to foodborne illness and public health infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries that hand washing with soap is essential to prevent such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "proper handwashing techniques" were hung outside public toilets, in office buildings toilets, and at airports in Germany.
The saying "washing one's hands of" means that a person declares not to take responsibility for something or to say nothing.
The proverb originates in the Bible in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate expressed disagreement with Jesus' execution, but it later became a proverb in English-speaking society.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth finds herself forced to keep washing her hands in an attempt to clean up a fictional stain, which reveals her remorse for the crime of murdering her husband.
It also turns out that people wash their hands more often than others after remembering or contemplating immoral acts, and they place a high value on hand washing dishes.
What's more, people who wash their hands after such thoughts are less likely to engage in other "cleaning" activities, such as volunteering.
Religions also recommend hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, that is, the use of soapy water to wash hands without soap, is a feature of many religions: for example, the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Torah in Judaism, Nithila Yaddam, Lawu in Christianity, and Wushu in Islam. Religions recommend hand washing according to hygiene, especially after certain tasks.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, washing hands after using the toilet is mandatory.
And in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam, it's mandatory to wash your hands before and after every meal.
Manage workplace risks for COVID-19
Workplace risk management for COVID-19 refers to the implementation of occupational safety and health measures to prevent the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk management depends on the workplace and the nature of the work, the risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of illness in the community, and the workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are those with minimal occupational exposure to the public and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, breathing etiquette, and keeping the work environment clean and disinfected.
Medium exposure risks are jobs that are in contact with people who have no known COVID-19 infection, but may be affected by social migration and international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the public, such as in schools, in densely populated workplaces and in more retail locations.
In addition to basic infection prevention precautions for this node, risk management includes high-performance air filters for air traffic, protection against sneezing, and personal protective equipment if encountered by an infected person with COVID-19.
OSHA has identified exposure of health care and mortuary workers to a person with or suspected of COVID-19 as a higher risk, with a very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures or collect or handle samples from a known or suspected person with COVID-19.
These workers will need to take appropriate measures to control the risks, such as negative air circulation pressure rooms, and personal protective equipment that is appropriate to the nature of the work.
The COVID-19 outbreak in the workplace has many possible impacts.
Workers may be absent because of the risk of illness, the safety of others, or the fear of exposure to illness.
The patterns of trade can change, both in terms of demand for goods and in terms of the supply of those goods (such as shopping at low peak hours, or delivery or drive-through facilities).
Finally, geographically disrupted supply from areas severely affected by COVID-19 may lead to disruption of supply. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used to guide preventive actions.
The plans identify the risk levels associated with different workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community setting, and risk factors for individual workers such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the control practices and contingency plans for the outbreak situation that are necessary to deal with these threats.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional proposals.
The goals of an epidemic response include reducing transmissions among staff, protecting those at risk from adverse health complications, and reducing adverse impacts on business operations and supply chains.
The severity of the disease affects the response in the community where the business is located.
The hazard management classification framework is widely used in occupational safety and health, to effectively manage group hazards.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are those that are put in place, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
The controls that are being developed are to isolate employees from work-related risks, regardless of their behavior, and this may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Management control refers to changes in work policies and procedures, which require action from the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some emergencies.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risks to workers, be properly installed, if applicable (e.g., salination device), be worn consistently and properly, be regularly maintained and replaced, whatever is needed, if properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-disclosure jobs are those with minimal professional contact with the public and other colleagues.
The basic measures recommended for infection prevention in all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing etiquette including covering the face when coughing and sneezing, providing tissue and litter, arranging for phone conversations or alternate attendance if needed, encouraging workers to use other people's tools and equipment, and routine cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Identifying and isolating potentially infected individuals is a worrying step to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until the fever, fever, or other symptoms subside for at least 24 hours without the use of fever or other symptom-reducing medications, and that sick leave policies are flexible, allowing employees to care for a sick family member, and that employees are aware of these policies.
Medium risk of exposure, according to OSHA, are jobs that require close or continuous contact at a distance of six feet (1.8 meters) from people who are not known to have suspected or infected with COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission around the business, or because the individual has recently traveled internationally where there has been mass transmission of COVID-19.
This includes the installation of high-performance air filters, increasing air flow rates, plastic guards to prevent material obstacles such as sneezing, and installing drive-through windows for customer service. Administrative controls for this and high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual conversations, coming to work, cancelling travel to places where COVID outbreaks may occur, and talking to customers in a post-workplace, providing access to personal protective equipment, including hand-washing or hand-washing, training and training, and providing access to health and safety equipment to reduce the risks of COVID-19, and providing training and training to those who need to work on a regular basis, including the use of masks and protective equipment to reduce the risks of COVID-19.
Workers in this risk group rarely use respirators.
If someone gets sick on an airplane, it refers to adequate controls to protect crew and other passengers, keeping the sick person at a distance of 6 feet from others, assigning a staff member to the patient, and offering the sick person a face mask or telling the patient to cover his or her mouth and hands with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
When contacting a sick passenger or touching bodily fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, the crew should wear disposable gloves and potentially additional personal protective equipment, if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in purpose-made bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial ships, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk management includes postponing travel in the event of illness, self-isolation, and immediately notifying the onboard medical center if fever or other symptoms appear.
The CDC recommends that schools and child care centers be closed for short periods of time so that if an infected person has been in the school building, even if he or she has not spread the virus, it is cleaned or disinfected.
When there is a small to moderate transmission of the virus, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as outdoor activities, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or music classes, or cancelling meals in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, limiting arrival and departure times, avoiding unnecessary visitors, and using separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a substantial amount of migration in the local community, in addition to social distancing policies, long-term school closures may be considered. Law enforcement personnel who are carrying out their daily activities are considered to be at a low immediate health risk, according to the CDC.
It is recommended that law enforcement officers who have had contact with people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 follow the same guidelines as emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during the panic, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belts and gear using household cleaning sprays or wipes before reuse, and follow standard enforcement procedures for the use and disposal of used PPE and laundry.
According to OSHA, some health care workers and mortuaries are at high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk jobs include health delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who have been exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
They become highly exposed when workers take aerosol-making action, or collect or administer samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
In the process of making an aerosol, a duct is inserted, a cough procedure is performed, a throat duct is inspected, some dental procedures and examinations are performed, or a collection of malignant samples is performed.
High-risk exposures in morgue jobs include workers who prepare cadavers of people who had known or suspected COVID-19 at the time of death; these risk groups include additional controls, including rooms reserved for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol preparation procedures are followed.
Special negative pressure air circulation devices may be appropriate in some health centers and mortuaries.
Samples must be handled under Biosafety Level 3 protective measures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in designated waiting rooms depending on whether they are suspected COVID-19 cases. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of a known patient or suspected SARS-CoV-2 person, and those who perform aerosol-making procedures.
In light of a comprehensive and documented safety respiratory program in the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filtering respirators or better should be used, including appropriate testing, training, and clinical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend full coverings, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only surgical masks for staff at the entry screen site.
For those who are collecting respiratory samples, caring for or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, eyeglasses, or face shields, gowns, and gloves.
If an aerosol-forming procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Recognizing that global delivery of PPE is inadequate, WHO telemedicine, material barriers such as clean windows, allowing only those who are directly caring for a COVID-19 patient to enter the room, the use of PPE is essential for specific tasks, using the same respirator without a drain while caring for multiple patients with the same disease, monitoring and managing the supply chain of PPE, and discouraging the use of masks for people without symptoms.

We're experiencing some unusual things this month.
The global pandemic of COVID-19 is what has made it clear that humans are universally connected and have responsibilities to each other.
We have no precedent for this challenge, but we know that our best response is global empathy, cooperation, and community building, which is the spirit of this organization.
The sense of friendship and attention that we've seen in all of our colleagues through email, phone calls and chat, all of this is a testament to how lucky we are to be working with amazing people.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud that you are all my colleagues.
Last week, someone complimented me on our work.
He reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol it is for this fragile resource that is available to everyone online.
Your work makes it possible, whether you're with the sites or our colleagues who are funded or our communities are safe.
The world needs information and Wikipedia provides it, now more than ever.
This is the moment when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to make some important changes this week in how we work together.
Changes in our work and schedule
As Robyn previously expressed, we had a c-team meeting last night to discuss our vision and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we thought about what would be the most appropriate response to what we're facing and how to get the organization back on its feet at that time.
We wanted to break the long-term tension and advance our mission.
If you want to dial, fine.
All staff, contractors and workers:
Our daily work expectations will be about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week, in reverse order.
We're not announcing a vacation - if you can work on your regular hours, the mission can put you to use.
However, there's nothing to say about the world at this time, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, buy a grocery, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
Do not work if you are sick.
It doesn't have to be said, but we're saying it.
No sick days or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team reset the calendar and schedule, making sure all aspects of the job are done.
(If you are tested positive for COVID-19, notify Bryan within T&C Ops, so T&C can help with support and make sure your situation is properly addressed by management.)
Friends who work by the hour will be paid in full.
We've said this before, and we're repeating it to our contractors and our hourly staff as we pass our responsibilities.
Each person will be paid according to the hours they meet during normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people work in the world around them to change their stress.
What we can do is incredibly useful, especially on days like this.
Again, this is all for your own safety.
We're just saying that you talk to your manager, and we'll figure out what to expect from you and then we'll make things right.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we need to keep going.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising teams (among others) do hard work, which may require additional support.
We're going to review current goals with all departments and shift our focus to support what's essential to our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we all just focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt us later.
We're not planning that once this pandemic is over, we'll "get it done".
You're not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines, which is unrealistic right now.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and where appropriate, we will work to set new goals and timelines.
What is the APP?
To align our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to establish our 2020-2021 annual plan.
We intend to expand our 2019-2020 plan, which takes more time to create a budget where workers will be able to shift their work priorities, and look after their loved ones while accommodating those in need who want to work less.
This extension of time will greatly reduce the current planning work and pressure across the institution.
We will present our plan to the board next week and as soon as we get confirmation, we will inform the delegation and the teams about the next step.
Thank you for leading the APP team in this.
Office status, appearance, and cleanliness
Last week, we heard that a friend of ours in SF may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, with extreme caution, we hired an anti-virus team at our San Francisco office to clean all surfaces.
They used a hospital-grade disinfectant to clean every surface, including the rafters and the arms of the stairs that lead to our roofs.
This building is using its own look-alike protocol products that take the safety of its tenants into account.
We feel reassured that the office will be fully ready by the time we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in Warwick, which has shared its COVID-19 protocols with all DC office staff members and us.
And just last week, our D.C. office moved to a remote location that meets the shared guidelines of San Francisco.
As many of us in NYC know, we're also renting a place in Brooklyn.
These talks are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our friends are working remotely for the first time.
Our old-timers know that this can be a little bit of an adjustment and they want to give you some advice.
The length of the meetings can be increased to one or two hours at most.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to divide them up over different days.
Set the agenda for each meeting, and send the reading material first.
Make video the default, using features like Google Docs and Zoom for live collaboration and interaction.
Take the lead in providing support for each meeting, with someone supervising the discussion for questions and keeping track of the list of speakers and someone helping to take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
If you need a comfortable headset, email technical support.
Use your welfare payments for snacks.
Join the #RemoteZ channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about shared work.
The HR Operations Team is considering webinar-based ergonomics guidance to collaborate on distributed car throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all social funders to cancel Wikimedia-sponsored public events, such as Eid-ul-Adha, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
They should know that we believe that our cancellation request and other restrictions may make it possible for them to complete their agreed cooperation activities and that there will be no penalty for modifying or slowing down these targets.
Over the coming week, we will be following up on additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic social conferences.
The general feeling of the entire global community is saddened by this disruption but satisfied by the clear ability to focus on their own communities, Wikipedia, etc.
Moving forward, CRT is working on a web page on MetaWiki to provide the community with opportunities to track their interactions and monitor their impact.
Stay in touch with COVID-19 related issues.
We will be sending out an invitation to your calendar for a special meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We'll use that time to share updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we're going to help each other as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive information from this email and other important information about COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
The CRT will put this page together with all the updates and other information in one place.
We are working on maintaining regular contact with staff members currently residing in the most affected countries.
If you have a trip, an event, an important work schedule, or a coverage challenge or anything else that you need help with, please do not hesitate to work with CRT and get updates.
We are here to provide support and communication when needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive matters, please email Brian Judd, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a departure from our duties and responsibilities.
They're an opportunity, and our work and our responsibilities will need to be blended in a way that we've never seen before.
These are the steps that we believe are essential to help each other so that we can keep working, give our movement the support it needs and the service to the world it depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be there waiting for us.
From now on, it's about helping each other out and taking time off for the important work that will come in the next few weeks, maybe months.
To do that, we need all of you, and that's why it's important for you all to take care of yourselves and your families so that you're in the best shape when it comes.
Now, please, keep your hands to yourself and don't touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J. Dorian D, Gregory V, Jim V, Joel L, Lent L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the team leadership (Grant I, Heather W), Jim V, Jenni U, Lisa S, Rubin A, Ryan M, and Toby N.)
B-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ACE2 counters the action of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing the amount of angiotensin (1-7), making it a reliable drug for the treatment of heart disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry point for coronavirus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme is a type of zinc-2 containing methanol enzyme found on the surface of the endothelium and in the rest of the cell.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, with its enzyme-activated domain expressed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other fibers.
Outside cells the domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called shadesis, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream which is eventually excreted through the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is primarily associated with lung type II spider cells, small intestinal enteroids, arterial and virulent endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the outer membrane of the brain, the corpus callosum, from the little finger down to the elbow, and in the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an antagonist of ACE.
ACE supplies the hormone angiotensin I to the closed blood vessels of angiotensin II.
In turn, the ACE2 carboxyl terminal isolates the amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also isolate a number of other peptides including [des-org9]-bradycyanin, apylin, neurotensin, denorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the transport of natural amino acid-carrying SLC6A19 membranes and is implicated in brain disease.
As a protein translocator, ACE2 acts as the central intron in the cells of a few coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the fluctuating binding of the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the cell surface of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein causes the membrane contents of a cell to be ingested inward and both the virus and the enzyme to migrate within the cell.
This process of intervention also requires the initiation of the S protein by the representative serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is under ongoing investigation as a potential treatment. This has led some to conclude that, with decreased ACE2 levels in cells, it may be easier to fight disease.
However, several professional societies and organizations have advised against continuing with the common ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of an ACE inhibitor was associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Moreover, the risk of pneumonia B, which was at high risk for pneumonia, particularly in those with stroke and cardiac arrest, was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors.
ACE inhibitors were also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related deaths, although their effects were less pronounced than the overall risk of pneumonia".
Human transplants of ACE2 (rhACE2) are being promoted as an innovative treatment for severe lung injury, and it has been shown to improve hemodynamics and oxygen delivery with a lipopolysaccharide mixture with symptoms of severe respiratory distress.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes with a 24-hour effect (duration).
Several results suggest that rhACE2 may be an optimal drug for those with intolerance to the classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or in diseases where angiotensin II circulates excessively - elevated rhACE2 uptake has been diagnosed during clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress.
B'COVID-19 apps are mobile applications that help keep in touch during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, for example, identifying people ("contacts") who have been in contact with an infected person.
With the support of the government, several such applications were developed or proposed in several regions and jurisdictions.
Several application frameworks have been developed to find the connection.
Privacy concerns were raised, particularly regarding the system that allows the app's user to locate a palace.
A less intrusive alternative involves using Bluetooth signals to transfer the user's location to another mobile phone.
Google and Apple jointly announced on April 10, 2020, that they would collaborate on integrating this type of Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to track whether they have been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19.
They're used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, they're using an app called TraceTogether.
The app was created by a local IT community, released as open source and will be referred to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called "Stop Corona!" that can track the proximity of potential victims and provide immediate response to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Information and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
The government said on 12 April that the contact tracing app is in the next stage of development and will be available for launch within a week - similar applications ("Stop Covid") are planned in Ireland and France.
Australia and New Zealand are both considering applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and the Bluetress protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for diagnosed COVID-19 patients based in Moscow, to ensure people do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has identified a number of potential practical challenges to app-based systems, including the possibility of false positives and low effectiveness if the app is used by only a small segment of the population.
Eliminating concerns about the spread of fake or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to their App Store, limiting them to "official" or otherwise well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy pioneers have expressed concerns about the countless surveillance restrictions on the coronavirus app, especially whether the surveillance arrangements set up to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be lifted once the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance arrangements.
These agencies have announced eight conditions on government projects:
supervision should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
The extension of surveillance and observation should be for a certain period:
The use of data will be limited to the purpose of COVID-19 only;
Data security and anonymity shall be protected and evidence-based security shall be demonstrated;
Digital surveillance must avoid excessive discrimination and disregard for the importance of the data;
The data to be shared with a third party must be disclosed under the law;
Precautions against abuse must be taken and citizens have the right to respond to abuse;
The deliberate participation of all "relevant stakeholders" will be required, including public health experts and non-significant groups. The German Caucious Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter Oehn Grenz (RSF) also released watchlists.
The proposed Google/Apple project aims to solve the problem of constant surveillance from its operating system device, by eliminating the monitoring mechanism when it is no longer needed.
Some countries used network-based location monitoring systems instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and the ability to avoid surveillance.
Network-based surveillance was adopted in Israel.
Network-based solutions, which access the raw data of the opportunity palace, are likely to cause significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems connected to central servers require access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems have been created that use only central servers for mutual updates (see below).
In South Korea, an app-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a perfect application, the system would collect surveillance information from various sources including surveillance data in a mobile device and card data exchange, and then collect all of this to generate a notification via text messages for potentially affected individuals.
In addition to using this information, the government has made the information available to the public to alert potential contacts, something that has been allowed due to far-reaching changes in privacy laws when the MERS outbreak hit the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites - countries like Germany have also considered both centralized and privacy protection systems.
Details were not released until April 6, 2020.
Privacy-protected contact monitoring is an improved concept, with a substantial history of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth's weak energy (BLE) to enable the user to enter the premises from another mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is an integrated effort that consists of both centralized and decentralized methods, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include: decentralized privacy protection location monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), contact temporary numbers (TCN,fka event contact number, CEN), sensitive privacy protocols and procedures for keeping mobile connected (PACT), and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device and is transferred to all matching devices.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing Secure Paths, a platform to use privacy-protection techniques when collecting and using location or intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research by Qartus Abyss, "Apps GonRog: Maintaining Personal Privacy in a Pandemic", released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology developer originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was founded by a number of groups that came together for the purpose of sharing a vision and a widely-accepted protocol, to reduce the scattered spread so that monitoring and monitoring apps can be activated globally as a mutual capability, which is a key aspect of achieving mass adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the Bluetress application, an application used by their government, open source.
On April 10, 2020, the companies controlling the Android and iOS mobile platforms, Google and Apple, announced a move to contact tracing, which they claimed would protect privacy based on a combination of weak Bluetooth energy technology and privacy encryption.
They also published specifications of the actual technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be implemented in three phases:
Implementation of these protocols will enable governments to issue official privacy protection applications for coronavirus detection.
Google and Apple intend to address this constant monitoring problem by integrating its functionality directly into iOS and Android - first distributing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way once the threat is resolved.
Drug reverse-engineering (also called drug target reengineering, re-profiling, function reversal, or treatment reversal) is the modification or use of a drug approved to treat one disease to alter the clinical status of another disease rather than the drug being used for the disease for which it was originally developed.
This is an online scientific research that is currently underway to investigate an effective and safe treatment for COVID-19.
Other directions of research include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfer of plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 pharmacologically active proteins, each of which has multiple sequestering sites.
Analysis of these clustering sites provides a proper plan for developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most prominent target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papine-like, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helices, S proteins, and ADP ribosphate, proteins.
Hussein A. et al studied several candidate compounds which were then modified and analyzed with the highest approved drugs for structural similarity in order to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in preclinical studies, to be prescribed in clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used for some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and its synonym hydrochloric acid would be among the four drugs to be studied in cohesive clinical trials.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York's official trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, F. Dreh authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
The FDA has not approved this treatment in clinical trial procedures and it is only authorized for emergency use under its EUA for patients who are hospitalized but not able to undergo a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 disease has not yet been determined".
Doctors say they use it when "there is no other option".
A research group in Istanbul, Turkey, is conducting a short study on the use of chlorokin in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting an experiment on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydrochloric acid.
Experiments by China in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipravir was "clearly" effective.
In Shenzhen, an average of 35 patients tested negative in four days, while the 45 patients who did not take the medicine had a duration of 11 days.
In a study of 240 pneumonia patients in Wuhan, half were given favipiruvir and half were given youmifenir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the current evidence supporting the drug is limited and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its own storage, and use it by the military in university hospitals, where it will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has overwhelmed the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug - which may be less effective in cases of severe illness where the virus has already spread.
It may not be safe for use in pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
A study of lupinavir/retinavir (Cleitra), a combination of antiviral lupinavir and retinavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to the prosthesis.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that would bind to the proteases of SARS-CoV-2. There has been criticism in the scientific community for turning to drugs that regenerate resources, especially those developed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included lupinavir/retinavir in an international coordinated trial.
Remedicivir was developed and promoted by Glade Science for the prevention of Ebola virus disease and the treatment of Marburg virus diseases. Subsequent Glade Science quickly discovered that there was in vitro antiviral activity against several phyllo, fumo, paramexo and coronaviruses within Remedicivir.
One problem with antiviral therapy is the promotion of resistance by mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that there may be a high genetic barrier to resistance to remdesivir. Several such clinical trials, including two run by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with mild disease and one for people with severe disease, are included.
There are three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease; two sedative-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began a trial of the azithromycin antibiotic on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for taijin's alveolar (silsonide), a steroid-based hormone used to inhale asthma patients, to treat patients infected with the novel coronavirus who have not shown symptoms.
A form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is a phase II trial that will select 200 critically ill patients admitted to hospitals in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment in them.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called Colcorona, is selecting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, who had COVID-19 and who showed mild symptoms but did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or women who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight liver and bile acids are being widely used to treat patients, which has warned the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients investigating the use of inoxparin sodium in prophylaxis and treatment was announced in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, all scientific attention has been focused on reproducing approved antiviral drugs, such as those developed during the first emerging outbreaks of MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Rebavirin: Rebavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines.
Ufenvir: Rebovirine was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of China Guidelines.
Some antibiotics that were potentially re-usable for the treatment of COVID-19:
Toxizomba (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Trials also in Italy and China.
The BA COVID-19 vaccine is a dummy vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine to be developed for SARS-CoV-2, and that the vaccine for the causative virus would be available in less than 18 months.
As of April, five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety trials.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major pandemic broke out in the world in 2020, which led to a significant investment and research effort in developing a vaccine.
Several institutions are using advertised saline substances to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was stated that the necessary steps of the CEP to develop the vaccine are accelerated, the capacity of the manufacturers, the scale of deployment and global reach.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms are under research and development to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19 by early 2020.
The Phase I safety studies include several major platform targets:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (stage I developers and vaccine candidates: Conno-Sino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of vaccine development, 78 are confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 announced but few public information is available about them (thought to be in the planning phase or under design).
Phase I-II trials are preliminary safety and immunity testing, typically randomized, drug-controlled, and multi-site, while determining more precise, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and the efficacy of testing a vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse effects at higher doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet testable in humans (still in "preclinical" research).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that could enhance an immune response by genetically modifying viral proteins.
On or about January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada announced that it would begin work on a vaccine, with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.
Plans to develop a vaccine were announced by the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and by the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, headed by Heneke Schutemaker, announced that they had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a development partnership with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, Romania's Anco Gene Laboratory published an article on the design of a vaccine that resembled the technology used to treat cancer with the Novantgen vaccine.

On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 separate individuals and at a rapid pace that would take at least two and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the production of a coronavirus-like particle in partial collaboration with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered 'big money' to Kürrreich for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government had protested against.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop a joint mRNA-based vaccine.
The candidate RNA-based vaccine BNT 162 is currently in preclinical trials with clinical trials expected to begin by April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, an Italian company, Taxis Biotech, announced that it would undertake preclinical trials by April 2020 and begin human trials of its vaccine candidate by autumn.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemiological Innovation (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Consortium, comprising the Institut Pasteur, Thames Biosciences (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Other CEPI partners in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine include Moderna, CoreWalk, Inovio, Novavix, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of four different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-developing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
This vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on COVID-19 response medicine, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as MediCago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Government of Canada announced C$192 million specifically for the development of COVID-19 vaccines, with several new vaccines planned to be established as a national "vaccine bank" to be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Petersburg School of Medicine reported experiments on Petcovic, a possible COVID-19 virus in mice, saying that "MNA showed a strong antibody response to the antigen-related SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine [in mice] that was clearly evident 2 weeks after vaccination".
On April 16, 2020, in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced plans to design a vaccine based on DNA as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophysics, DNA will be engineered to replicate harmless virus-like particles within human bacteria, which will boost the immune system's antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities raised resources to gain access to IBM supercomputers, which will be bundled with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprises, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means they may have benefits beyond the disease they want to avoid.
In Australia, 4,170 healthcare workers are being enrolled for another randomized trial.
It is possible that vaccines may not be safe or effective in the developmental stages.
Early research to test the efficacy of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal samples, such as ACE2-containing rats, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, identified the need for international coordination to ensure biosecurity level 3 measures to deal directly with the virus, and standard protection mechanisms.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, no vaccine or treatment for SARS has been discovered that is safe and effective in humans.
According to a research paper published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs to treat SARS has been a priority of governments and public institutions around the world. There is no proven vaccine for the treatment of MERS.
When MERS was first discovered, it was thought that the current SARS research would be a useful model in the development of treatments and vaccines against MERS-CoV disease.
As of March 2020, one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were released, all vector-based viral vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 virus was known and its vaccine already available.
Patents appearing in various social media posts point to current patents for genetic sequences and vaccines and other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, nausea, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include dizziness, joint pain, menstrual diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from onset to onset of symptoms is usually five days, but can last from two to 14 days.
Although most cases are mild, some cases go as far as viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 countries and regions, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been infected - the virus is transmitted primarily through close contact in the public, often in the form of droplets from the mouth when coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets are similar to those that come out when you exhale, they often fall to the ground or floor, instead of spreading the disease over long distances.
People can also contract the disease by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands after touching the infected surface.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours on surfaces.
It is most contagious within three days before the onset of symptoms, although it can also spread in the pre- and post-symptomatic stages. The standard method of diagnosis is the temporal reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the kidney in the human embryo.
The use of masks is recommended for people who are suspected of having the virus and health care providers.
The proposal for masks for the general public is controversial, with some officials opposing their use, some recommending their use, and some calling it mandatory.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Most countries in all four WHO regions have recorded local transmission of the disease.
People infected with the virus may not have any symptoms or may experience cold-like symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, chronic chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and bluing of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, seeking immediate medical attention is advised.
Symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may also be seen in the upper respiratory tract.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal diseases such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
In China, a few cases were initially reported with only chest tightness and dizziness.
In some cases, it can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to four days but can be as long as two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of being infected.
The fever of these asymptomatic infected people is not fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may be contagious.
The proportion of people with the disease who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases during hospital stay were asymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began counting asymptomatic cases in its daily cases from 1 April; 130 (78%) of the 166 infected patients were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both Tewk and Belgaum may have a high viral load.
Speaking out loud produces more droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that droplets of the Khangsi go up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) without a tail.
Although the virus is not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioresonant transmission may be possible and positive viral RNA samples were found in air collectors in hallways outside people's rooms.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can aerosolise respiratory fluids and result in airborne release.
Now while there are concerns that it's spread through waste, the risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; and if it's possible to spread the virus before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three people. The virus can survive at varying levels for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be active on cardboard for one day, plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days, and 99% copper for four hours.
However, it does vary with humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are effective if used correctly; soap products inactivate the virus's protective oily layer, as well as cleaning the virus from skin and other surfaces.
Other solvents, such as benzconcium chloride and chlorohydrin gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In one Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken within an average of two days of admission to hospital.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load in the second day of testing.
Severe respiratory symptoms manifested by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe respiratory disease coronavirus, first detected in three people in Wuhan with pneumonia associated with severe respiratory illnesses.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in nature in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which ruptures its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 resembles the original SARS-CoV.
Monkeys are the organs most vulnerable to COVID-19 because the virus accesses these host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most commonly found in monkey type II mammalian cells.
The virus uses a special surface glucose called a "peplomer" to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
12% of those hospitalized in Wuhan, China, had severe heart injuries and are often found in severe illness.
Cardiovascular symptoms are associated with increased rates of inflammation and disease throughout the body due to immune system diseases, but severe cardiomyopathy in the heart may also be associated with ACE2 receptors.
2ACEs are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
Intensive care unit patients infected with COVID-19 had higher incidences of arterial blood clots (31%) and thromboembolism (25%) and may be related to poor diagnosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a bias for the appearance of ACE2 respiratory tract cytokines, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of more than normal inflammation affecting the body.
In particular, pathogenic SM-CSF-secreting T-cells were associated with inflammatory IL-6-producing monocytes utilization and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19-infected patients.
There were also reports of lymphatic cell intervention at the time of postmortem.
The WHO has published several diagnostic methods.
The standard method of testing is time-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
The test is usually done on breath moisture samples obtained from the nasal mucus; however, nasal mucus or saliva samples may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but it requires two samples every two weeks and the results are less important in the short term.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a variant of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect infectious disease caused by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which detect active infectious disease and whether someone has been infected in the past) were in development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test showed only 60% to 70% accuracy.
The FDA approved the first end-of-month care testing center for use in the United States on March 21, 2020. Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University issued diagnostic guidelines to detect the epidemic, taking into account clinical features and epidemic risk.
In early infectious disease, bipartite polychlorinated, ground glass opacytes with surrounding, inappropriate and subsequently fragmented haze are common.
As the disease progresses, complete overwhelm, crazy-pushing (thickness of the curved veil with variable sheath-like veils) and stability may appear.
Some data are available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main findings of the postmortem were:
Microscopy: inflammation of the pulmonary membrane, inflammation of the cortex, stability of the lungs and swelling of the lungs.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: swelling of the lungs, increased formation of pneumocytes, large abnormal pneumocytes, ruptured inflammation with lymphatic cell penetration and formation of polymorphic giant cells.
Severe pneumonia: decreased loss of appetite (DA) with decreased appetite sweating.
DA is associated with the onset of symptoms of acute respiratory distress (ARDS) and severe oxygen deprivation in the body.
Pneumonia: organization of excretions in the alveolar glands and pulmonary duct
Blood: Dissemination of blood clots in the veins (DIC); reaction of white and red blood.
Precautions to reduce the chance of disease include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and the use of an elbow-in-the-knee if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommended the use of face coverings in crowds, to limit the spread of the virus from people who do not show symptoms. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact with large groups of infected individuals by closing schools and offices, imposing travel restrictions, and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include keeping people at a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 meters).
No effective treatment has been discovered for COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until before 2021, a key point in managing COVID-19 is to reduce the peak of the epidemic known as "flattering the crow".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after cleaning their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
It further recommends that hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol be used, but only when soap and water are not readily available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO recommends two formulas for local production.
In these formations, antimicrobial activity is produced by ethanol and isopropanol.
Alcohol uses hydrogen peroxide to help kill bacterial spores; it is "not an active ingredient for hand defense".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are being managed with supportive care, including fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other critical organ support.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracortical membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory obstruction, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and better diet have been suggested to improve immunity.
Supplemental therapy may be used in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of an epidemic. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized people with COVID-19.
In the United States, pediatricians and pulmonologists have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical experts recommend paracetamol (methylamine) as the main drug to replace ibuprofen.
Precautions are necessary to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in medical settings where a medical procedure involving a faucet, such as an IV or manual ventilation, is being performed.
For medical personnel caring for individuals with COVID-19, the CDC also recommends that the person be kept in an airborne infection room (AIIR) in addition to general precautions, contact precautions, and precautions for airborne germs. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: PPE gown, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. When available, respirators are preferred (instead of face masks).
The N95 respirator has been approved for industrial use but the FDA has only authorized the mask for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particulate matter such as dust in the air but do not guarantee their effectiveness against any specific non-approved biological agent.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or homemade masks, as a last resort.
People with COVID-19 often do not get so badly that they need mechanical replacement or alternatives, but a small percentage of patients do.
The type of respiratory support is being actively studied in hospitalized individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure, with some evidence that inlet ducts with high-flow nasal cannulae or bi-directional positive airway pressure can be avoided.
It is not known whether either of these benefits the terminally ill.
Some doctors prefer aggressive mechanical catheters when available because this procedure limits the spread of airborne particles compared to high-flow nasal cannulae. Severe disease is more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years).
In developed countries, there is a lack of beds per capita, limiting the capacity of health systems to handle the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization.
One study found that in China, 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% had deaths.
30% of people infected with COVID-19 in China are eventually admitted to the intensive care unit.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as COVID-19 increases acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure-controlled mode and high PEEP-enabled ventilators are needed to maximize oxygen delivery and to minimize the risk of lung damage and chest air congestion associated with ventilators.
There may not be much PEEP available on old ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems the most promising.
Although it may take until 2021 for new drugs to be developed, several drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in the advanced trial phase.
Antiviral medications may be tried in people with severe illness.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials of potential treatment efficacy and safety. The FDA has authorized the experimental use of plasma from artificially recovered individuals when a person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been tested in clinical trials to prove its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to stop the spread of the disease.
The user will be asked to enter his name and ID number.
The app can detect "close contact" and therefore the potential risk of infection using surveillance data.
Each user can also see the status of three other users.
If a potential danger is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local medical officials. It uses mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking and big data analytics on artificial intelligence to track infected individuals and contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people who may have coronavirus.
The move was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who come into contact with the infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the data collected from mobile phone location with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to conduct research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deploys facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
The Italian regional health regulator said it had been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are still wandering around".
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with 42,000 candidates.
Estonia's President Kristi Kajolyd also raised the international voice to find creative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may have difficulties due to quarantine, travel restrictions, adverse effects of treatment, or fear of the pandemic itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Excessive social distancing, isolation, health anxiety, stress and economic hardship are a complete disaster for people's mental health and well-being".
Some or no symptoms may be mild, similar to other common respiratory illnesses such as fever.
Normal patients generally recover within two weeks, while severe or severe patients recover within three to six weeks.
Based on other viruses such as SARS and MERS data, pregnant women may also be at high risk of COVID-19, but data for COVID-19 is not available. In some people, COVID-19 infects the lungs causing pneumonia.
In severely infected individuals, COVID-19 can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) which can lead to respiratory failure, body decay or multiple organ failure.
COVID-19-related complications include body decay, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Abnormal blood clots, particularly in 6% of COVID-19 patients, were found to be associated with an increased blood clotting period, while renal dysfunction was observed in 4% of the patients in this group.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 had an elevated level of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same document, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were spent in the hospital.
However, the median time to death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
In one early-patient study, the median time from onset of early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full course of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
Postmortem lung examination showed extensive damage with injection of a family of fibromyoids into small oils for the presence of air in the lungs.
Biovirus cell disease-related changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The picture of the lungs is similar to symptoms of acute respiratory distress disorder (ARDC).
According to the National Health Commission of China, 11.8% of deaths were due to troponine or elevated heart rate.
According to United States data from March, 89% of hospitalized patients already had some form of disease. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomics of the region may also affect the mortality rate.
Estimates of mortality vary by region, but this can also be due to difficulties in procedures.
A low rate of normal cases could lead to an excessive death rate.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of diseases that were already present means that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers had 1.4 times the incidence of severe COVID-19 symptoms and 2.4 times the need for intensive care or mortality rate compared to nonsmokers. Concerns are being raised about the long-term effects of the disease.
Hong Kong hospital management saw a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some recovering patients, and lung examinations indicated organ damage.
This can lead to the development of severe post-convalescence symptoms.
As of March 2020, it was not known to have long-term immunity in people recovering from past pandemics.
Immunity is seen as a potential based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but there have been cases where recovering from COVID-19 has been shown to be positive for the coronavirus again.
These cases are believed to be aggravated by a long-term infectious disease rather than a re-infectious disease.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated as an animal-borne infectious disease.
The exact source is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the pandemic was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, shows that the first case of symptom onset occurred on 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the first date of onset of the disease as 8 December 2019.
Several steps are usually taken to determine sperm mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the start of the epidemic, and demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and U07.2 to clinical or epidemic deaths from COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death and incidence ratio is now 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths among confirmed individuals, and the epidemic mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths among infected individuals (confirmed and unconfirmed).
These statistics are not of a specific time and cover a specific population from disease to resolution.
Although not all infected individuals show antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people are infected.
At the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy is a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, Castellones d'Adda, where 80 (1.7%) of the population has already died.
In Gangot, the spread of disease was caused by Catholic Christian festivals, and spread to younger people, which led to a relatively low death rate, and not necessarily all deaths from COVID-19 were classified in this way.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of patients may have antibodies, as measured by blood donors.
69 (0.004%) people have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of pandemics and mortality rates are different for men and women.
Studies in China and Italy have shown that men have higher mortality rates.
Men are at highest risk after the age of 50, while the male-female gap ends at only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact causes of this sex difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Sex-based immunological variations, reduced smoking in women and men, and the incidence of other diseases in men than in women, such as high blood pressure at a young age, may increase mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking the gender-based statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A large percentage of medical staff, especially nurses, are women, and they are at higher risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO President Tetradros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to coronavirus, VI to virus, D to disease, and 19 refers to the day the first case occurred: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographic area (e.g. China), animal species, or group of people, taking into account international recommendations to prevent stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 has been named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public correspondence.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the early outbreak in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan virus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended nCoV-2019 and nCoV-2019 as the provisional names for viruses and diseases, in line with the 2015 directive against using place names in the name of diseases and viruses.
On 11 February 2020, the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released.
Due to the capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing medical devices such as nasal sprays and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needed ventilator valves, and the vendor couldn't deliver them in time, a local craftsman replicated it and made the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial spread of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misunderstandings about the disease's origin, duration, prevention, treatment and other initiatives emerged and quickly spread on the Internet.
Humans can spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral development in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
Research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is ongoing by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "collaborative trials" to evaluate the effects of treatment with the four most effective existing antiviral compounds.
No vaccine is available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the same means of ACE2 to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine for the entire virus.
Using such a virus, whether it is inactive or dead, it will create an immediate immune response in the human body against the new COVID-19 disease.
Another strategy, subcomponent vaccines, aims to develop a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subcomponents of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research is focused on the S-spike protein, which helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme portal.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, the novel method of vaccine production).
The experimental vaccines developed from these strategies will be tested for safety and efficacy - the first clinical trial of the vaccine began on March 16, 2020, in Seattle on four volunteers.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic code that was copied from the virus that transmits the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancers have been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials are testing a drug that's already approved for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The majority of Chinese research is on re-prescribed antiviral drugs, with nine Phase III trials on Remedicivir reported in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, dynamic evaluation for candidates for development and use of COVID-19 vaccines was underway. Several existing antiviral drugs are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lupinevir/retinoir, and lupinevir/retinoir, which are synthesized with interferon b-ta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence of efficacy from Remdesivir.
Patients treated with reduced use of Remdesivir saw clinical improvement.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, the research community is calling for a review.
The Korean and Chinese medical administrations recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice the dose can be extremely dangerous and deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorization for physicians who are treating patients with COVID-19 to use their discretionary prehydrochloronone and chloroquine.
Preliminary data suggest that higher doses of robavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 within the organism.
Nitrozaxane has been suggested for further vitro studies as it demonstrates low concentration in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early subcutaneous lymphatic priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for entry into SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major impediments that have prevented the medical community from accepting the treatment without further studies. Ozeltavir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of OVID-19.
Cytotoxin flow can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine has anti-cytocin characteristics. After completing a brief study, the National Health Commission of China added tuzelizoumab to the treatment guidelines.
Italy is undergoing a nationwide phase 2 randomized trial after positive results in severely ill patients.
The combined serum ferritin blood test to identify the causative kinase stream is intended to counteract such developments, which are thought to cause death in some infected individuals.
In 2017, the FDA approved musanthropicin 6 receptor antagonists based on past studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine-releasing disease that is susceptible to a different cause, namely CART cell therapy.
To date, there is no random, controlled evidence that tosilezomab is an effective treatment for CRS.
A clean and concentrated antibody produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19, transferred to those who need it, is being investigated as a passive immunization of a passive vaccine.
This strategy was tested for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is a potential mechanism by which passive antibody therapy may provide a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of induced monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of the hygienic fluid, which is the liquid part of the blood of recovering patients and contains antibodies specific to the virus, can be prepared for early use.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
A doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, Li Wenling, became infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
