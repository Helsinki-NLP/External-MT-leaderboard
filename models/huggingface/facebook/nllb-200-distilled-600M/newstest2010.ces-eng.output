Barack Obama is the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to take home the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US president in history.
Among other things, he will receive a diploma, medal and a check for $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief will be flying to the Norwegian capital this morning with his wife Michelle and he'll be busy.
He first visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with five committee members who in October elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple has a scheduled meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonya.
The afternoon will be followed by a ceremony to celebrate the award ceremony.
He's the fourth U.S. president to win the award, but only the third to win it directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will be speaking about the war in Afghanistan at the awards ceremony.
The president doesn't want to avoid this issue because he realizes he's taking the price as a president who's currently at war with two countries.
The war effort has been increased a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to emphasize any of its critics.
Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for 10 million Swedish kronor (about 24 million Czech kronor).
He's going to give it to charity, but he hasn't decided on a specific charity yet.
The President will then take the program to a banquet where, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests will be present.
Obama has been more restrained about the price from the beginning.
For example, he said that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that the price is not just for him, but for all who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said that he was "calling to action".
Nature Conservancy Accused of Blackmail
Litomerec police have accused the president of the Litomerec Society of Nature Conservancy of blackmail.
In several cases over the past year, he has appealed to some construction authorities, demanding money from investors to his advantage for withdrawing appeals, said the Litomero police spokeswoman Alena Romova.
The president of the Litomers Society of Nature Conservation is Lubomír Pozdnica.
He's now in custody and facing up to three years in prison.
Brno's grading containers don't smell very good.
In Prague, ordinary people can sort their packages of drinks, and in the South Moravian villages, you'll find sorting containers at every turn.
What about Brno?
There you can take a few minutes to find a suitable garbage dump.
I don't want to say that the garbage in Brno is not in order.
But I think that as the second largest city in the republic, the council is not interested enough in this problem.
The problem with the forestry waste sorting league is not only that we as citizens can still throw paper, glass and plastic into sorting containers, but above all the number of garbage cans for that sort of waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a PET bottle into a collector's basket in the center, for example?
It's a finished piece, but it takes time and a lot of nerve.
The only place I've ever been is Moravian Square across from the Meeting House.
I don't want Mr. Onderk and his colleagues to be mad at me, but I don't think it's gonna be much.
Not to mention that there's no honey in the waste sorting in other parts of the world.
A lot of my friends don't like to sort out the garbage.
It's just laziness.
They're far from garbage.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself after the party to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored garbage in the street.
Luckily, I came across the right place on the way to the party.
But the waste was running out.
It's still the centre of Brno, which the city represents most, right?!
But ecology and some aesthetics are probably not very much of a concern to Brno socialists.
They'd rather buy a hockey league that would embarrass the entire republic than buy a few extra containers and offer to sort out more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to confirm my guess with official statistics after a moment's internet browsing.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is the worst in the whole of South Moravia.
"Paroubkov" budget took money for pensions and sickness
After the left has added to the farmers or officials, despite the government's opinion, there is no need to have money in the budget for pensions, sickness or building savings.
But also interest on government debt or international litigation.
This will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for increases to certain groups, they relied on government to borrow extra for sensitive spending, pensions, or sickness. "It's just putting the problems behind us, laying mines", says Janot.
Interest on borrowed money is increasing and must be repaid at some point.
The state has no choice of where to take it.
If they do not reduce social security benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To everyone left now she's added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later on, their children.
The pension or sick leave, which has 1.8 billion missing from their accounts, people don't have to worry about, they get it.
But at the cost of getting more debt next year, not just 163 billion is missing in the treasury, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janot, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it, the interest costs.
The state will need money to pay it off and it will no longer be enough to raise VAT slightly or cut the VAT as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
The money transfer to several groups of voters will also mean that next year there will be a $5 billion shortfall for highways and railways.
These are mainly already challenged and dismantled sections which cannot be redesigned and possibly discounted.
Mostly reserved, which is not free.
This means 30 large buildings are being delayed or stopped, and European money is also being drawn, warns Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The CFSP proposed that the money loss be settled by the Czech Republic in the form of a dividend to the CZE, which is majority owned by the State, and that the transport fund should contribute to it.
The problem is that dividend payouts are never certain, and it's not a source of income at all.
Last year, 18 billion went to the budget of the CCE.
Each year, the dividend is used to pay environmental damage, supplement the pension account or serve as a reserve for the pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP under EU rules.
But that doesn't end the carnival of the relocation.
Nearly $3 billion was spent on various compensation to victims of communism and crime, on legal disputes, and even on building savings.
Whether we can get away with this money is uncertain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay anyway, says Janata.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, at worst, reach the government's budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing from the already launched $2 billion Treasury project, which aims to allow online monitoring of how individual agencies spend.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister can't find the money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped, sanctions will come, Janot warns.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems.
Americans are counting on a mobile phone in the future where a user can switch between different operating systems with the push of a button.
The plans revealed sound promising.
You just press one key and you'll be transferred from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This is exactly what VMware, an American company focused on developing virtualization software for computers, is aiming for.
We'll let you run two user profiles on your mobile at once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will be working at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware suggested in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first performed a few days ago.
It'll be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems to the press.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM running alongside the Windows Mobile and Android systems mentioned above.
The development of new mobile phone technology is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization and should be available to customers by 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains is a problem for hoteliers
The hollow slopes are not just a concern for the crocodile hunters.
The lack of snow is also discouraging people from ordering ski accommodations in hotels and boarding houses.
That is why there are still room vacancies available in the Krkonoše for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors to our site.
People go through the bids, find out the prices, but so far they're afraid to order seriously.
And when they call us, they ask if we think Christmas will be in the snow or in the mud this year", said Martin Jandura, the owner of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year's Eve at Spindler Mill exactly as you want, you shouldn't hesitate to order.
If you prefer to save money and stay in second place, you can wait a few days.
Spindler's hotel companies are offering only weekly New Year's holidays.
I think they'll try to turn them in for a while, but then they'll let me go for a little while.
And then the empty rooms will quickly fade away", Jandura estimated.
A bed free in all winter dates is still offered by the top travel agency Ingtours.
Now we're most interested in the Christmas week that hasn't sold out yet.
Half the seats on our offer are still vacant.
That's why we've already planned some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute", said Peter Schiefert, Managing Director of Ingtour.
New Year's Eve in the Krkonoše can still be offered by a top travel agency, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first 14 days of February are also selling well, with the rest of the winter months selling on average.
This year's interest in wintering is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if he attacks.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If snow slopes are snowed during the week, they will sell out at Christmas", says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it's a little better than last year to book rooms at the Horizon Hotel in the Snow Under Fence.
We're about five percent better.
We've got the last few seats for New Year's and Christmas.
There is a great interest in the Polish holidays in January and February is also selling well", said Karel Rada, director of the best bakery hotel.
Of the 80% of New Year's Eve stays, Omnia Hotel at the central parking lot in Janskys Lázny is also occupied.
On the contrary, at Christmas, half the beds remain vacant in the newest Janskoläse hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, which is already about 60% occupied.
February is a little weaker, but once the snow falls, interest in staying in the Krkonoše will certainly rise, Omnia Hotel's manager Erik Sporysch said.
But for the greater snow supply, hotel owners in Krkonoše must keep their appetite going.
It's supposed to be cool on Thursday, if there's any rain, then the mountains should be snowed.
But then the warming is to come again, said Jiri Jakubský from the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute's Castle Workshop.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It's funny how schoolboy-friendly Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor, who he considered the stupidest, in the Afghan issue.
When he finally swallowed his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had written it through a copy of Bush's Iraq script three years ago.
Not only does he use the word "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he didn't hesitate to even use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement as the title of his own declaration: "A New Road Forward".
Three years ago, he himself criticized Bush's idea to send fresh troops to civil war-torn Iraq as "irresponsible and consequently disastrous".
But the months that followed showed that Bush's strategy based on the recommendations of the field commanders was the only possible and successful one, so much so that no news reports today mention Iraq at all.
Bush's reputation was not enhanced, but he left his successor objectively a much more grateful starting position than might have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
The increase in the military contingent was again requested by field commanders, most notably the senior commander of the Afghan operations General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his subordinate habits, harshly criticized the heavy shooters in the White House.
He asked for 40,000 men to help him turn things around.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn't think of anything better, so at least he cut the general off by 10,000 troops.
He managed to keep the promise of another 5,000 from Europe, although he had originally counted on at least 10.
The most problematic aspect of Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete the process in three years.
Many doubt that a halved increase will bear the same fruit as the Iraq process.
Despite the fraternal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honoring agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is characterized by the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are being respected.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces are poorly prepared, accustomed to changing masters every day as they see fit.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain a post-tribal village, where patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is unusually difficult given the overlap in the relationship, which further complicates the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even building an "accessible state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, doesn't seem very realistic.
The timeline of Obama's strategy is going to be a bit of a mess with his volunteerism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only gotten worse and is now on the verge of explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent to warfare for the purpose of "a swift return home" will cause the miracle here performed, can only souls truly romantic, untouched by reality.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is a clear irresponsibility, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect recognition of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is down.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their constituents how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindukush hills.
Another factor that could have a radical impact on the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions against Iran are not affected, the United States will face a difficult question of whether to try to resolve the problem by military force.
The answer will be needed at a time when, according to Obama, America is moving toward a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also be a dramatic turning point in the Afghan situation.
The only glue for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential election is three years away, so there's still plenty of time left for him to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs managers will no longer receive cash rewards
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
The company announced the move, which was in response to a sharp criticism of its wage practices.
Instead of the money, the group of 30 senior executives will receive a share that can be sold within five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs is now leading the effort to combine Wall Street's rewards with long-term performance, Reuters reports.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former investment banker at JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has come under fire after it spent nearly $17 billion on rewards in the first three quarters of this year.
The company's total salary this year, according to Reuters, is expected to exceed $20 billion, despite the measures announced today.
High rewards in the banking sector became a hot political issue in many countries with the advent of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that it intends to tax bankers' bonuses in excess of £25,000 (about £712,000) at a one-time rate of 50%.
France is preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
A record five women today in Stockholm have taken this year's Nobel Prize in Literature and Science from the hands of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.
Among the four women scientists was the Romanian-born German writer Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their fellow American biologist Jack Szostak, for their research in chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to Israel's Ada Jonathan, along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last winner was the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was won by the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic governance.
The only subject that went without a title this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for their research in fiber optics and George Smith and Willard Boyle for their invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines, and astronomical telescopes.
Each recipient received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of the winning of the financial reward.
This amounted to 10 million Swedish kronor (about 25 million CZK) for each category.
If more than one of the winners is awarded, the prize is divided among them.
The most traditionally anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
He acknowledged in his speech the controversy of his award, as he is only at the beginning of his career and also leads a country that is fighting two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in defending his policy, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations to bring about peace, even if the price is high.
The Minister is considering resigning, and Klaus has invited him to the Castle.
President Václav Klaus is hosting Finance Minister Edward Janot on Friday morning, who is considering staying in government because he disagrees with the form of the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps Janot's stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meetings.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
He said the deficit was too high, which further exacerbated the public finances crisis.
The meeting was informed by the President's spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janata wants to discuss her continued tenure with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the budget bill that Klaus is now getting signed, the Czech Republic should handle a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But on Wednesday, the House approved the left's proposals to move money and raise money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democracy proposals for covertly increasing the budget deficit.
This has led to a sharp internal political dispute between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, leading to a questionnaire on the further functioning of Fischer's official cabinet, which was formed by the ODS, the CEDAW and the Green Party in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, essentially eliminates the package of austerity measures that the Fischer government imposed in the autumn and which it believes are intended to halt the debt of the state.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the state budget bill, said at a breakfast discussion with a businessman that politicians had long ignored a "serious problem" called the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He doesn't think there's a good solution today.
Only a strong government could improve, and it could rely on a wider consensus of political parties, the president said.
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, said the budget was scary and the government should consider further existence.
The Deputy Chairman of the ODS Petr Nečas told the Czech Republic that the concept of a cabinet of officials supported by the USSR, the ODS and the Greens no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer called the similar words "strong statements".
The head of the CSSD, Jiří Paroubek, responded to Topolánka by saying that the budget deficit that the former Topolánka government prepared for this year, which exceeds 200 billion crowns, is appalling.
On Wednesday, the CFSP declared the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The people were also satisfied.
Mandel was played by Morgan Freeman in the Clint Eastwood newspaper.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories despite some critics saying that the lead roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, age 90, asked him if he could play him in Eastwood's film.
Another major role in it is Matt Damon.
I said, 'If I'm gonna play you, I'm gonna have to have access to you.
The 70-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, has played the leader of the abolitionist movement, who eventually became a slave, the fictional president of the United States, and even a god in Divine Evan, but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many as Mandela.
A former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active work to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became the country's president for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is the Latin word for "unconquered" and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain François Pienaar to help unite the country.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team will eventually qualify for the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for years to get Mandel's story on the screen.
I had no other goal than to play this role in a way that brought it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was for me to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world's politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
Most importantly, he wanted to shake hands with Mandel.
I found that when I shake your hand, I take your energy, it's transferred, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important to me to try and be someone else.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby union team, in a film dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was finally meeting Pienaer at his home for the first time.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened it, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the marked differences in the cast's characters compared to their actual performances, Invictus: Undefeated received positive reviews and Oscar ambitions were also mentioned.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his review in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film".
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received a 76 percent positive rating.
The secrets of the glow over Norway uncovered: Russians test a missile
A strange light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry just yesterday admitted that it was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch was again unsuccessful and the missile, designated as the "Bulava" type, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a nightmare for Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in rocket tests had no effect on the success of test flights.
The bulva usually didn't take off or get damaged in the air.
The Russian newspapers already refer to "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights up
This is the 13th attempt in the series, and it was normal at first.
It wasn't until the end of the flight that the machine was technically damaged again.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, the "Bulava" was launched from the Dmitry Donsky nuclear submarine, which was swimming beneath the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows firing from a moving vessel while it is submerged.
So it's likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by a nearby unidentified flying object was actually disturbed by the "Bulava".
Besides, the Norwegians didn't doubt it was a Russian missile from the very beginning.
The generals are defending themselves this time, saying they can't talk about failure without a clear word.
The first two rocket levels have been successful, and the third has been hit.
In previous cases, the engines have been damaged in the first degree.
Although not a single test run was completely flawless, only six of the 13 are considered by the Department of Defense to be unsuccessful.
Almost 50 percent of the success rate, therefore, fills the generals with optimism, and they still claim that the Bulava will one day fly smoothly and that it will even carry up to 10 hypersonic nuclear warheads with a maximum total mass of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed a 51-year contract with CSKA Moscow
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will once again be playing in a professional hockey game at the age of 51.
Former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will help his team CSKA Moscow in need and will appear in the KHL's Friday match against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we need another defender.
Fetisov is a regular coach and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to get some formal details done, the AP quoted Moscow club coach Sergei Nemchinov as saying.
It's not clear if the return of the famous hockey player will be a one-game show.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of other players, said the German.
Fetisov will become the oldest Russian professional hockey player, according to the AP, if he returns to the ice.
In the NHL, at age 51, he played a full season for Hartford legendary forward Gordie Howe, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union's uniform, he won two Olympic golds, seven world titles, triumphed at the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
He also enjoyed success in the NHL in the latter part of his career, winning the Stanley Cup twice in Detroit.
He's been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has complied with the union's demands.
Hyundai's car rental management has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the often-ordered overtime that the unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai car company spokesman Petr Vaněk.
But the union is still trying to negotiate another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign our production plan, which is essential, so a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19th with two shifts, said Vanek.
Server Sedmička.cz wrote that the company of employees working Saturday shifts offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
People will get it back on Saturday, November 28.
According to Vanka, the company has decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime.
They can either get paid overtime or choose a replacement holiday on 28 December, thus extending the Christmas holidays by a day, Vanek said.
In addition, all Saturday shift workers will receive paid tickets and lunch.
Since overtime was the most pressing and painful point in terms of comments and complaints from both unionists and protest workers who stopped production last week, management decided yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtime for the month of December with immediate effect, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the car company's employees were forced to work two hours overtime on an eight-hour shift almost every day.
After the agreement is signed, the unions shall call off the strike emergency.
The next meeting between the car company and the union is scheduled for Friday morning.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike.
The situation at the car dealership escalated last Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay and alleged harassment.
The management objected that overtime was required for employees to meet the requirements for car deliveries.
The workers also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on workers who stopped production last Wednesday in their strike alert issued on Monday.
In the overtime sector, unions are demanding that the company minimize overtime.
Plus, they're willing to pay a reward of 5,000 crowns this year.
Hyundai carrier now employs 2,000 people.
The company launched the series production last November.
By September this year, it had produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: substance that can even catch 'hardening' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the enhanced product is that it also takes on viruses that have already gained immunity to medicines.
This is a fact that in some cases prevails over the fact that the compound on a common variant of the virus is not as effective as some medicines already available.
AIDS is still incurable.
However, a mixture of medicines that prevent the spread of HIV in the body can significantly extend the life of patients.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of the virus's propagation results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, the University of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to tackle resistance to the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalcarborates act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV.
Metalocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds prevent the spread of the virus unlike any drug used today, and therefore they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new, improved compounds prepared based on knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to a viral protein.
Metalocarbonates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-layer cages made up of boron, hydrogen, and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case, cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an HIV virus protein that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by the breakdown of HIV, no mature infectious virus particles would be produced.
By stopping HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cells (see table) are connected by a short organic chain that is then systematically altered.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effects of this series of substances against HIV protease have been tested in the test subject and against resistant (resistant) variants derived from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalcarborans on the normal enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinical medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which medicinal products are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical treatment of both metalcarborans, make them interesting compounds for further research into the design of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezecová, Head of the Structural Biology Laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
The budget debate, the ODS has gone to Fisher, he's defending himself.
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for next year "terrible" and said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS statement strong.
He says he's taking time to analyze.
The deputy chairman of the ODS, Petr Nečas, said that the concept of a cabinet of officials supported by the CZSSD, the ODS and the Green Party no longer works.
According to D'Time, the Prime Minister must decide whether to rely on the Parliamentary minority to fight the growing deficit or to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the SDGs and social democracy to public deficits is diametrically different, Nečas pointed out.
The House on Wednesday adopted the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments worth more than CZK 12 billion.
The House has raised money for public employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's burden on the Social Democracy proposals was that they were secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the House before the vote, meeting the government's wishes, so that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the budgetary interim.
Disappointment and Vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, and Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would assess the situation further.
Ne Zaman believes that if he had seriously threatened to remove Janota if the amendments were adopted, the situation might have looked different.
According to Czech TV, Janot has ordered a government order for the prime minister on Monday.
He also indicated that he was considering continuing his term.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer is to speak out for further fighting the budget deficit, according to the time in government, the nominees of the USSR, which has enacted the budget changes, have nothing to do.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House passes further deficit-increasing legislation, such as those relating to sickness, pensions or a new Labour Act.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have not been guilty
It's a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated for the ODS have done nothing wrong, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the US.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people in deputy positions who report to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Neither time stressed that if Fischer decided to resign from the principle of fighting the higher public deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he should rely on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House".
But then he says he can't count on the support and tolerance of the civic democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and when it's up to date, I'll do it", Defense Secretary Martin Barták told reporters in the House, who was nominated by the Citizen Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels this afternoon for the European Council meeting.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS withdrew
Neze stressed that the SDGs would likely vote against the amended budget in the House on Wednesday unless the PM, the civil democrats' MP, explicitly asked them to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not little children, he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was not undermined by the absence of the party's president in parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice was missing.
When I resigned, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about the Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
Under the new rules, fewer trains will run at almost the same fare.
The Czech Republic will cancel or limit some of the less heavily charged expressways and routes from 13 December, while strengthening others.
The total volume of transport will be reduced by 2% from the date of entry into force of the new rules of carriage.
Most fares, including basic and passenger fare, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of Ostrava will have more connectivity options to the capital, with tracks adding one set of pendulums to the route.
The speedway, on the other hand, will stop travelling to Bratislava.
The road Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will also run less fast, substantially limiting the direct connection between Prague and Letohrad.
The regions are planning the biggest reduction in traffic in the Královéhradec region, a total of eight percent, with Prague and the surrounding area expecting an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route are also cancelled and the operation of several express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route is limited to certain days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milović to Prague, today the Milović must move to Lysé nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko suburban system, which is possible by completing the electrification of the line from Lysé over Labem to Milovic.
The long-distance connections to the capital will end at the Prague Main Station.
The Czech Republic will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Schumperka/Jasenice will run at two-hour intervals.
The transit to Bratislava will be suspended from 13 December.
Regional railway accounts for this year: 200 million more
The Ministry of Transport orders and pays the expresses, giving the costs of the so-called demonstrable losses a total of 4 billion crowns next year, as this year.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
The tracks for both locomotives and expressways have a newly signed ten-year contract, so far it's always been a one-year contract.
The roads praise the system, and that's why they apparently didn't raise the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
Only one-day network tickets for ČD Net and cheap eLišk tickets will be subject to change.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of the Czech Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of the e-liquid will be re-developed from the distance taken, so far the cost of travel between any regional cities has been the same and amounted to 160 crowns.
The Philippine military still holds over 50 people, children released
Armed forces have abducted 75 people today in the southern Philippines, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 abductions.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 gunmen are said to be using hostages as a live shield to flee the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to reach an agreement on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police initially pursued the kidnappers for violence that required settlement of accounts between two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines, the province of Maguindanao has declared martial law in response to a recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Among the victims of the November 23 gubernatorial election massacre were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan dynasty, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of JAR is about everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film Invictus (official title in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated) will be released in the United States, capturing part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of a world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter was taken up by Morgan Freeman, who Mandela himself chose years ago for his role.
The male supporting role of legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaara has been played by Matt Damon.
The film's release comes from the critics' and the public's comments.
Nelson Mandela
His full name was Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, born on July 18, 1918, in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 he and de Klerk received the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The Commission's report on the implementation of the programme for the European Union's programme for the promotion of the sport of football (soccer) is a major concern, given that it is coming to the public at a time when preparations for the World Cup in South Africa are at an all-time high, but at the same time the media are shaking by disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black majority.
According to the AP, the reviews for the new film in JAR are all positive for now, despite numerous reservations about the casting of the lead roles by "professional" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of his new film, according to his own words.
I've dreamed of this role for years and I've been preparing for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela in person many times to - as they say - recharge his energy, he said in an interview after the film's Los Angeles premiere.
I think it's good if we can use the movie to remind us of Mandela's personality and message.
It's the story of South Africa, but it's about every human being, he added.
In the national rugby team dress
Based on the book introduction by British author John Carl, the film is a loose adaptation of the novel In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Brought the Nation, portraying a South African human rights activist during his first term as president.
Morgan Freeman, in the course of the film, tries to blend two racial and interdependent groups of people over the years and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the role of actor in the South African national rugby union team for the World Cup, which JAR won at the time.
For entering the lawn in a dress that is considered almost sacred in the JAR, Mandela gathered a large ovation from a predominantly white audience 14 years ago and gained recognition from the white population.
The World Cup may bring people back together as one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only black member of the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in the JAR will improve is yet to be seen.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as revealed in a recent interview with LN by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
A transformer burning in Lounsk costs tens of millions of crowns
A fire broke out this morning at Cheps's transformer in the distribution plant in the village of Vytkov in Lounsko.
According to local firefighter Luke Marvan, six units are involved in the fire.
Initially, the firefighters wanted the transformer to burn, but later they changed their mind and put out the fire with a mixture of water, foam, and special detergents.
The cause was a technical malfunction, an internal shortcut to the transformer.
No one was injured, the accident, according to company spokesman Pavla Mandatová, does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
Damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, to be calculated exactly after the fire is over.
The mandate says the damaged transformer will need to be replaced with a new one.
In the ten years of Cheps' existence, nothing like this has happened, and the defects of this type are unique, she added.
According to ČEZ's spokeswoman for Northern Czech Republic, Soni Holingerová Hendrychová, electricity supplies were not interrupted, the operation of households, offices or businesses was not affected by the fire.
A.s. Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the transmission system, 400 kV and 220 kV electrical lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 power plants with 67 transformers that transfer electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and a 4,339-kilometre pipeline.
Jančura is filing a criminal complaint for libel against three Czechs
Student Agency owner Radim Janchur is today filing a criminal complaint for libel against three social democratic heightmen.
And that's to Michael Hash from South Moravian County, Radko Martin from Pardubi County and the heightman of Olomouc County, Martin Tesařik.
Janchur reported it on the 20 Minutes Radio Journal.
The complaint concerns the company's efforts to operate regional rail transport in certain regions.
But all the regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Dragons.
All three of the thugs are attacking us and talking about picking the roses, while we've only offered what they want.
They say we're more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have nothing left to do but defend ourselves.
It's for slander against the Student Agency, said RadioJurnal Janchur.
It also stated that it had evidence from all regions that they had not taken action in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing a motion for a resolution for the European Commission.
Hashek considers the criminal complaint a continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertisement for his company and his own people.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my good name and my country and to call on other leaders to do the same.
I suppose it will be clear on this occasion that it is Mr. Janchur who is manipulating the public on regional rail transport and using false and false arguments, Hašek said.
Janchura announced last week that it was investing several million crowns in advertising to warn the regions of a disadvantageous move.
He told the radio station he's going to stop the Christmas campaign and he wants to continue it after New Year's.
He specified that the campaign would be against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched in Jančura after the countries agreed to operate regional railway links with the Czech Republic and did not tender for the contract of about 150 billion kroner.
According to Janczura, such an action is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of rail transport in the counties, he said that a member of parliament for the CFSP had already threatened Jančur.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus license.
He introduced himself as a member of the USSR, I know which man he is, I will not say his name, said today to RadioJurnal Janchur.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and non-compulsory
The pneumococcal vaccination since January has been a habit-breaking thing.
It's supposed to be the first thing that families get free and unconditional.
But there are already voices that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations to introduce free pneumococcal vaccination are on the rise.
The FDA already sets maximum vaccine prices that health insurers will pay.
Experts are also clear on the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for children in August
From January, children born on or after 2 August can be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease free of charge.
The condition is that they haven't received a single dose of the vaccine yet.
If you've been vaccinated for a year or so, you'll have to pay for another vaccination.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child' s age.
Already last year, a quarter of families voluntarily had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose or more.
Four doses are required for vaccination of youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurers spend between $300,000 and $450,000 a year on vaccines.
But it will save on the treatment that unvaccinated children would need.
So far, the state has been paying for all the vaccinations of children, about 500,000 a year.
The vaccine was introduced in a pack called Janot.
Pneumocoke causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain stem and blood poisoning.
According to a study in hospitals, up to 28 children under 10 will die of pneumonia each year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, a comprehensive vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, there are also suggestions that in the future, such vaccination may be mandatory.
It's been insured since January and is non-compulsory.
For example, the head of the civil society Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsky suggested that the mandatory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference that our association attended were not entirely satisfied that we had a voluntary vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we're glad we've managed to enforce at least this.
I think that's the road we need to take now, Kalovsky said.
But the health department doesn't want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
We're not even thinking about it right now, his spokesman Vlastimil Srsen said.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
The President of the Society of Pediatricians of Practice, Hana Cabrnoch, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
"In a situation where the vaccine costs so much, we understand the political decision to start the vaccination as voluntary", says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The pneumococcal vaccine is groundbreaking, too, as the first comprehensive vaccination of children is paid for by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving money on further treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy the drugs themselves.
But that is the concern of practicing pediatricians about buying vaccines.
The original plan was for vaccines to be bought by insurance companies and given to doctors in the same way that the state supplies them with other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, feared that the insurance companies could "draw money from health insurance".
So doctors will have to buy drugs and wait for the insurance company to pay them.
It is estimated that individual pediatricians will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It's not going to be easy, Cabrnoch says.
The son of an American artist 'steals from a museum'
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was charged with attempting to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
A man named Mr. Frazetta and another man used a bog in the Poconco Mountains to break into a museum.
Mr. Frazetta Sr., 81, is famous for creating the characters Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press reported.
The AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying Mr. Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated by long-running family disputes.
Mr. Frazetta, 52, has given a statement before police that he did so at the direction of his father "to get into the museum in any way possible and move the paintings to the reconciliation rooms", the agency said.
Mr. Frazetta Sr. has denied granting any such authorization, as the agency has stated.
Labour is fighting planned tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, the Tories "missed" the opportunity to show they were serious about postponing the deficit reduction decision until after the election.
The chancellor was also targeted for disabling low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, the main thing is a rise of 0,5 per cent in social security and a 1 per cent adjustment in public payments since 2011.
Difference in social security
Trade unions protested that low-income workers were being punished for a recession they did not blame and warned in advance of "problems".
Social security is rising - an increase of about £3 trillion a year - angering the business community, who said it was an employment tax while focusing on economic recovery.
This increase, limited to those revenues above £20000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
Social security will increase by an additional 0,5 % from April 2011
Economic situation worsened more than expected by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers' bonuses
Increase of 1% of corporate tax on small business depreciation
Tax reduction for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increasing pension allocation by 2,5 %
According to the State's financial administration, some revenues of £30000 will be reduced by £90 per annum and some revenues of £40,000 will be reduced by £190 while some revenues of £10,000 will increase by £110.
Ministers announced that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 means "complex decision-making" but insisted that 60% of special taxes should be paid to the top 5% of the income earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax increases and spending cuts would be a "drop in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers, which will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is an absolutely essential requirement for the next four years", the BBC reported.
Mr Timms said he was convinced that economic growth should take place at the turn of the year.
But the development of forecasts for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of loans needed and how quickly the deficit will be cut - must be taken into account after the Chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In that opinion, he stated that the economic downturn this year was 4.75%, far worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, as loans were £3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
A missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who launched a new campaign on Thursday warning of a "debt crisis" for Labour, called the planned £789 trillion loan over the next six years unbearable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to make up for it, they added, "cynically" postponing the decision until after the elections - which are due to take place by June 2010.
"They have not given anything significant that could be done", said Shadow Secretary of the Treasury Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they have wasted it".
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them "
Roger Bootle, from Deloitte
Labour insists schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts unlike the Tories' proposals, which would like to reduce the deficit faster and on a larger scale.
But the Liberal Democrats say the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts should be used to support spending next year, not to reduce the deficit, and argue that the plans are "built on sand".
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said that timing the announcement - for example, the inflation mentioned above will rise and there will be an inability to pay benefits next April - could lead to the Chancellor being blamed for the election campaign if the money was hard to recover a year later.
But Labour is insisting on providing special assistance if people are to be in dire need and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
Suspicious budget'
Although ministers did not disclose details of expenditure after 2011, economists stated that it was clear that reducing public expenditure would be only the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The acclaimed Institute for Budgetary Studies reported that the Chancellor's figures suggested substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defence in the building.
"It's really very painful so far", said its director Robert Chote.
"Every important statement will come after the election, if we win it", added Roger Bootle, Deloitte's economic adviser to the auditor.
"It was a report on a suspicious preliminary budget.
FBI is conducting an investigation into 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating five Americans in a Pakistani prison suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested for an attack on a house in Sargoda, East Punjab province, the US embassy in Pakistan reported.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month at their home in Virginia.
The US State Department said it was also looking to get information about these men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestry and the other is of Yemen.
"If they were U.S. citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were held there", said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was briefed on the arrest and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities here and whether they are actually missing students", she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house owned by one of their uncles.
It stated that the house was always the focus of local police and that no charges had been filed against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the United States must "work much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to uncover the infrastructure of terrorism that is rampant in recruiting and training people".
The disappearance of these five students from their home in Northern Virginia was reported by their families in late November.
Refusal of amnesty for Iranian victims.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the past 20 years, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The report details the "torture practices" of the regime before and after the disputed presidential election in June.
One man said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above criticism of the report on human rights.
Officials have described the criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were imprisoned and dozens were killed after the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of them were arrested and the last five were sentenced to death by the prosecutors.
BBC correspondent John Leyne, now in London, reported that in earlier protests, Supreme Leader Ajjatullah Ali Khomeini declared some forms of torture illegal and banned them from being carried out in the Karzak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the law has been tolerated, as our correspondent has said.
False Confessions'
Amnesty International cited a report by 26-year-old computer science student Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook" and protesting the election results.
"I was often beaten in the face", he said in a statement.
"They burned cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened to execute me and humiliated me".
Five days later, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the election after protests and tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Senior Iranian officials denied the rape charges, but admitted torture.
Amnesty also reported a case of a former prisoner who said he was held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognised that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-war unrest and government responses, but said the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said at least 90 people were detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
Over 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn the Bristol memorial into a race track.
The park's race track attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park ski slope was a short jump bridge over a 100-meter-long slope.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a beautiful view from the top of the ski slope, but that it was really daunting.
It was a beautiful view of the flashing lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talent", he added.
Prizes were awarded for the best pieces or the best manoeuvres on the ski slope.
After the race on Thursday night, the snow was left to melt.
Always them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on minaret construction and alarming reports were spreading about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and pondered whether Muslims could integrate - and if they could integrate - into one of the continent's most open secular societies.
Some readers have become admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French Don't Like Headgear" (2006), an elegant and discussed study of the controversial issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a wider and more ambitious picture.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media have said about Islam in France, but what actually happened underneath it.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutions that now care for the 5 to 6 million French Muslims, what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He's a good listener, he's a good reader of the debates between teachers and students about the issues that worry them the most.
Should a Muslim enter into a marriage in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about gay development and rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use an interest-based banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
These seemingly secular issues are being discussed, and they are part of everyday life rather than the political drama that the media is engaged in.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others, not to mention Tarik Ramadan, Arab, a Swiss-born Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have no argument for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the true idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen interviewed tend to believe that this is the opposite of Selafi's purist Sunni Islam supporters, who are based in Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adjustment requires compromise on both sides.
He questions how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite who so vehemently advocates secularism) are really committed to the idea of pluralism.
He believes that Muslims are likely to have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who have also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found "the tightening of the screws of values".
After reading this book, one may be inclined to say, "Yes, but not now".
The Most Discouraging Prospects in the World
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet's environment.
The boundary ice melts at alarming rates, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be directed to new natural water resources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their awakening.
In his book On Thin Ice, Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, describes the natural history of the North's icon, the polar bear.
Well-versed in the complex history and practices of whaling, he describes a long tradition of polar explorers trying to capture a white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a brave 14-year-old sailor who fought only with a musket jug is a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
In the early 20th century, 75 polar bears performed in one circus tent at once.
Even today, the zoo's hedges are typically a million times smaller than the area available to adult wildlife.

Mr. Ellis draws on the work of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopters and skiing Indians are hunted, all armed with powerful assault guns to shoot their prey.
The irony is that it's in the waters north of these two hunter nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "On Ice", Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and uncomfortable view of science's responsibility for the Arctic and a fascinating insight into how the future can change it.
Scientists don't have answers for everything.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have an adequate response to the rate of change.
That's for lack of exams.
Fridtjof Nansen's exploratory expeditions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first suggested how floating ice moves.
Cold War submarines then mapped the shifting tides as they sailed.
Satellite exploration and a vast field of probes in floating glaciers are useful additions, but much is still being done thanks to the safe individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into an extremely fragile world of falling ice within the Arctic ice created by the leakage of salt water that crumbles when it freezes.
But from the above-mentioned bear to the microscopic wonders of the past, all of this is doomed to extinction once the summer ice moves, which will happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... we could be us
6,000 Marines laid wreaths on the graves of Arlington
Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a blank wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months, when we board, it could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happens to us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, to show me the respect that I'm trying to show myself.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to lay their wreaths at the Veterans Cemetery in several departments at the Arlington Memorial.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Funeral Society in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington Funeral.
It's now an 18-year-old tradition that Mr. Morill and his wife Karen make this trip every year and stop in different cities along the way to honor the memory of military personnel and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for a profit, crowns across America that they're betting on in other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to the purchase and transportation of crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made a trip to Arlington to honor her late husband, a member of the armed forces.
Since her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way of returning what the victim did.
It's a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in warm cloth, volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding grasslands and hills.
Volunteers have gone to older graves from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War because they are not as frequented as newer graves.
The mood was positive as the children played and held hands together as they carried the young pine to the stony tombstones.
Each round crown was dark green with a small red dog arch at the top.
Near the 60th Ward, where most of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are buried, there's been a real silence.
The combined service organizations devoted 1,000 crowns to decorating the department, but the turbulent mood of the ongoing wars filled the area.
Some were crying sincerely, others were praying, and family and friends were holding each other in the cold air.
Some read the names carved into the stones aloud, while others leaned down to see the little black and white namescaps printed in wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped their tears from their eyes at their son's grave.
She was driving eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of Artillery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we're single. . . .my son paid for it, the rules.
"Even after I've been gone a long time, I want to be the one to remember him".
US government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government supplier who imported cell phones and laptops into the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The supplier, who has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, were seeking access to the detainee, who was detained on December 5.
Certain charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is classified as "dangerous".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical statuses, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchezova, who often writes about how she and her husband are being followed and harassed by government agents.
Mrs. Sánchez has repeatedly asked permission to leave the country to accept the prizes, but her permission has been denied.
The withholding of the US supplier may be a result of growing tensions between the Communist Brother Castro ruling Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seen as a "containment tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report the arrest in the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition, the United States would take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a civil servant is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; they are mostly used for text messaging because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's wages.
Internet access on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government facilities, such as universities.
Cubans who want to sign up often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in Cuba's prisons are behind bars for criminal offences such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berben, a press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide any further information about the prison.
The imprisonment and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's call it free cell phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. Human Rights Watch program, which recently released an unfavorable report on liberties in Cuba, called "New Castro, the same Cuba", as a reference to the installation of Raúl Castro as head of state and replacement for Fidel's moody older brother.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that any solution would be more political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States as the two countries moved toward a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are uncovering a plot to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered an alleged leader of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case could help uncover a vast network of terrorist recruits who are spying on the Internet and searching for radicalised young men.
Investigators said they were looking for a gray rebel figure known as Saifullah who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one of the men posted a comment approving the terrorist attacks on the YouTube video website.
Saifullah took the lead of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them get to a remote area of Pakistan in the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convict al-Qaeda leaders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were deployed for several days to the eastern suburbs of Sarghody, far from the menacing mountains in the northwest that have become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
The reason for their suspension was stated by the official, who spoke of anonymity given the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain permission to access al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested under Pakistani law.
The case of this five - who remained in Pakistan and was interrogated by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is credible.
Since the September 11, 2001, attacks, the U.S. intelligence community has given the highest priority to efforts to deploy human resources to al-Qaeda.
The recruits of the organization act as guards, eliminating those who are not serious enough about their commitment to the holy war and those who could be scouts.
The US counterfeit recruits have been subjected to a special investigation by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious in recent years in allowing access to them because US intelligence agencies have acquired experts in their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has been followed so much?
This model is one of those that's much more web-based.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday, demanding more action on climate from negotiators at the city's Bella Convention Center.
Protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of people attending the event, but police say the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet, and a handful of masked activists laid down several small warehouses near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of the small event at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city carrying banners reading "This is not Planet B" in English and one in Spanish saying "The Earth is saying 'dough.'"
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helen Christensen, who said she had traveled to her mother's hometown in Peru and provided me with information about the country's dire state of mind, which is affected by the effects of climate change, which is still happening.
That's part of the reason we've decided to join this great march -- to go around the world and appeal to the world's leaders to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding deal, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, and it cannot always be avoided.
Police prevented protesters from approaching Bella Center and said they had detained 19 people, primarily because they were either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating spectators, who does not want to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and dressed in black have laid up several stations near the Copenhagen main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated at buildings, he said, starting with lights, but then "several big explosions" followed.
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march in the afternoon.
But the protest probably didn't reach key officials, like Su Wei, China's top climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English, "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of".
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the scene is large, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He watched if the march was painful or helpful depending on the prospects of each.
There is a focus on the general public and different sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of others.
Test data revealed persistent racial differences
Last week's federal certification of mathematics achievement was a welcome addition to the good news about Columbia County public education.
Although the district lays far behind the nation's highly efficient systems, the certification has shown greater progress among fourth- and eighth-grade students over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what's hidden behind the latest figures from the National Center for Teaching Excellence is the persistent disparities in knowledge gained between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average fourth-grade white students in the District of Columbia grew from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500) over the past two years, but their African-American peers only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The knowledge gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress for African Americans in eighth grade remains essentially flat, with a statistically insignificant one point drop from 245 to 245.
The mean result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture on the horizon of six years is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth-grade students in 2003, when the first NAEP was conducted in the district, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in the children from both groups improved during this period, the difference barely approached 58.
Some district education advocates said last week that the results celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were more widely stimulated among white students where they were already high.
That would suggest that we've increased the support of those at the top end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equal pay for equal work in the county.
I'm not jumping up and down because of a two- or three-point spread, said D.C. committee member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Often critical of Mrs. Rhee's administration style, Mrs. Brown said that reporting the results of the test means that the city's high school is in a desperate state and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the stakes, and I respect that.
But the terrible thing is that we spent almost no time and energy that was needed to devote to our secondary education.
Ms. Rhee said the district's effort is to continue to look for better ways to address the needs of low-resulting students.
This means, for example, that some teachers are trained to use the new reading curriculum, the Wilson reading system, aimed at high school students and high school students who failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their career and are significantly lagging behind their peers.
The daily math and sixth-grade math curriculum, highlighting the games and real-life experiences that came to the district under former principal Clifford Janey, can be attributed to the progress of NAEP that was reported last week.
And I think we should continue to work and do our best to help those students who are below the classroom level, Ms. Rhee said.
Others said that the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Ms Rhee could continue to reduce the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which is necessary to reduce the gap.
It's a certain dilemma of Mrs. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies the results of urban testing.
The convention's remedy is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of Columbia County.
So the focus can bring political vibes that go against the main agenda.
But the hook belongs to other city mayors who are trying to keep a middle ground between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We need to tighten the kinship between our schools so that all families, wherever they live, can count on their children to receive excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the principal of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that a key element in reducing the gap between achievements is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to allow for school eligibility.
You have to get up to 200 days to push through the changes, said Mr. Janey, who signed a contract with his teachers' association last year for a 185-day school year, which he considers a "sign" for looking for a bigger raise next year.
Making higher education a part of a better future
A coach was driving into Gettysburg with a loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stood up and rested for a moment on the white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawn.
Gracieli's parents had a hard time getting a college degree in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never been on the track.
Now she and other eighth graders in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38,690 a year, their position was more than the frightened visitors enthusiastic potential students.
Yes, that's it! Graciela, who would like to study medicine, called when the guide offered them access to the Knowledge Building.
Wow, really? She was thinking about it when they told them the low student-to-teacher ratio.
Pennsylvania College was one of seven they visited on their three-day tour and now they were completely taken by the message of the future: It's not a question of whether you're going to college.
The question is where.
But this is a serious problem with the high number of Spanish-born children in the United States who are expelled from college or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who get college education and enter the middle class.
In fact, about a fifth of this "spiritual generation" of Spanish college students - remarkable results - show that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, arrived in the United States without graduating from college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, because it underscores their point of departure for a generation that played a marginal role in the country's workforce.
Those who have achieved a higher education say they have a natural inclination toward school and an innate drive for success.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and sought ways to replace ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play a vital role in helping Graciela and the millions of children who would like to go to college - especially if these efforts persist over time.
Considering that children come from low-income groups whose parents lack the experience and ability to help them become established in the system, any simple intervention at any point will not solve this problem, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied Latin American students.
We need to think about giving these pre-school kids a network of ways to get through college.
The federal program that funded Graciela's railroad trip is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million annually to local school systems to launch training programs that start for low-income students in high school and continue until those students finish college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than a percent of whom have gone on to college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Industry has reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get major oil companies to rebuild their non-food infrastructure during two auctions on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in reviving the Iraqi oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies have gone with a stake in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies paid for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one made a lost bid.
Two American companies reached an agreement on a field that was auctioned in June.
The covert involvement of the US oil giants in Iraq's open oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you're moving Asia and Europe first, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
It'll be a long time before anything else is on sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the US military, are likely to deter US companies from doing much more intensive business in Iraq, which has the third-largest proven raw material reserves, analysts say.
The US companies have been at a disadvantage in some cases, in particular Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, which have significantly lower operating costs and are more risk-prone because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only US companies to enter into agreements with the Ministry.
Leading American companies like Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and offered technical assistance in recent years, have left with empty hands.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
The state-owned National Petroleum Corp. of China has been bidding for more contracts than any other company and has left with large shares in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic power as well as a technological power, said the spokesman for the Assam Oil Ministry Jihad.
We believe that Chinese companies will be competitive and will live up to their commitments to Iraq.
Companies which have been provisionally selected for bidding, which have been then compared by the Ministry by price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for the increase in output above the current level in each field.
Al Qaeda's top planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
In a US missile strike on the Pakistan-Afghan border this week, a senior al-Qaeda operational planner was reportedly killed, US counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets hit their car near the town of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have reported that the missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft of the type operated by the CIA in the area of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were directed at a white car heading to the Afghan border when it was hit, an official said, along with a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency who was calling from Miran Shah.
The official said local gunmen had seized the spot and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited an unspecified witness who said Somali was on death row.
Somali was listed as a senior al-Qaeda military operations planner who led terrorist groups' operations outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in worldwide imagery, said a senior official who did not wish to be named, who described the sensitive nature of US airstrikes on Pakistani territory.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was given instructions by the highest leadership of Al Qaeda and was planning terrorist attacks.
Another US official said Somalia was advancing rapidly in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known figure to some Americans, but he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose in front of us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somali was supposed to be the second high-ranking al-Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmudin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction within the indigenous tribal belt, and three other top opposition leaders.
The rate of drone attacks launched by the CIA has dropped from an average of about six operations a month this summer to two, according to records from the Long War, a nonprofit website.
The reduction may be justified by improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing people they suspected of being informants, the site said.
The UN High Representative in Kabul has resigned.
The UN's top delegate to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous term marred by accusations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed election of the president of Afghanistan.
Eide's departure is happening because the Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 American troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said he supported the increase but expressed concern that the US downturn schedule, which begins in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO countries to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the build-up of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans to have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The undertaking must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian personnel helping Afghanistan's political transformation.
The rise on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but that he was just keeping a promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to file a UN report.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now said he would need time to find a replacement.
Like I said, it's time to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun a search for a replacement.
Officials said the decision was made between Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian who previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhennem, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eid's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September of winning the country's presidential election by President Hamid Karzai of masking the presence of massive election machinations.
Eide denied the claim, but said that the accusation of Galgraith -- who was acquitted -- "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of the people to coordinate the easing of efforts to lead U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to borrow them for the Afghan mission, because he said he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money was being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitation of his efforts in Afghanistan and said the UN's tough recruitment regulations undermine its ability to use capabilities.
The UN rules are that I've had the option to get only one person since May, he said.
It's a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "further significant sanctions" on Iran over its lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a weeklong tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospects of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a question from the soldier about the likely development. ̈
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is the undeniable unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of those sanctions could also hit ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a lot of incentives and restrictions" would require "to make the Iranian government really feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer tremendously" from sanctions.
According to a statement issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Friday, the administration has engaged European leaders in warning that Iran will face serious consequences if it fails to fully comply with its nuclear program with the UN Committee on Nuclear Security and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on limiting his nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial part of his reserves of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed reactor fuel for medical research.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran has apparently withdrawn from the interim agreements - partly because, according to the expert, the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, as far as Iranian toughness towards the international community is concerned, in some of the proposals that he actually agreed to in early October, I think it has led the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline for Iran on December 31 to respond to the proposals before returning to seeking other options, including surveillance, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions".
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the UN condemned on Thursday what it called "unfounded and unfounded accusations" made to some members of the Security Committee about Iran's nuclear activities, saying it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach an adequate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki this morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
There is still high tension between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, particularly over borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce potential for conflict to prevent delaying US plans to limit the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to quell Kurdish concerns about the ongoing depression. U.S. officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you".
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that read that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One extra child means one extra grave".
Then they learned that when the official government offices in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and started encouraging young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We've always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We left nothing for the others, says Wang, 31, a human resources manager who has an eight-month-old son.
China's one-child policy, which has been in place for more than 30 years, has produced two generations of notoriously talkative and bully children, affectionately dubbed "little emperors", threatening the country's population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple, compared with six before the policy came into effect, according to the UN.
Population distribution, where the population aged 60 and over is projected to grow steadily from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050, well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is in larger rich coastal cities with higher education populations, like Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said many couples need children to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and reduce the number of jobs in the future".
He says it's about "being old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden".
Gradual calming
As enshrined in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate ever enacted under Communist Party rule.
Two people who violated the policy faced huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese officials have been promoting policies that have helped the country prevent critical harvesting of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned for their policies.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women to have abortions with their second child.
In addition, many couples have had to undergo sexist selective abortions, leading to unnaturally high male-to-female ratios.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually more lenient in their view of the one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed exceptions - including urban residents, members of national minorities and cases where a man and a woman were single - and in 2007, they relaxed the diction of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said that central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced with copies of the regulations detailing how to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and put flyers under their doors.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who chose to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
A Shocking Response
Although officials in a rural city near Shanghai noted an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign began, most city districts did not report any changes.
The city of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still recorded four to five cases a month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 was still expected to be around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's Kaolu district, said that financial considerations were likely the main reason why people do not want more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they wanted to have two children and they were legally allowed to.
But like many Chinese people, who only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a docile trapping network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West view the one-child policy as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yeah, we were sick of having more than one child.
But the problem isn't just politics.
It's about the money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, says that they only want one child because she was an only child: "We were the center of attention for our families and everyone cared for us.
We were not used to providing care, and we didn't really want to care for others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who runs a translation company, expressed it more clearly.
For middle-class parents who have reduced their fertility, he said, "Being successful means being selfish".
Today's 20s and 30s look at parents as being in the early days of China's experiment with capitalism and don't want that way of life for themselves, he says.
One child makes enormous demands on his parents' time, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the controversial questions of the residency -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a residency ready by the time your child is nine months old for a good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not two.
We're the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don't want to bring too many casualties.
The UN Group has developed a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching lack of commitment and mutual support -- again on Friday focused on releasing a document that proposes ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which can provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles and illuminates the way forward.
But there has been significant progress in the negotiations that have been held at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text bluntly states how much money rich countries should give to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of options for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies to limit their carbon emissions and what the upper limit of global warming that policymakers should be able to tolerate is.
This gives the process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, senior manager of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, is a 180-page abridgment of the text from the talks to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture".
It sets out the outlines for a possible agreement whereby the industrialized nations could jointly reduce their emissions by the year to 25 to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while the major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during that period.
Together, the countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union hastened to negotiate on Friday a pledge to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change -- from managing flooding and drought to preventing deforestation.
But Friday still listed the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in last week's interviews.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern rejected a speech calling for binding greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries compared to the willingness of major emerging economies if they were not financed by the developed world.
The move signaled that the Obama administration had imposed a tougher line against China by Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not join the treaty without transferring major developing countries and implementing actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to secure the restrictions and should be reviewed by external observers.
Stern made the comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei told the US chief climate negotiator that either a lack of "rural sense" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" had led earlier in the week to a statement that the United States would not provide financial assistance to China to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic trajectory of the major world powers at stake, tensions have broken out both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than the planet, between China and the United States about meeting their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two dozen of the world's most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative for more serious action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries became much more aggressive in finding ways to prevent big emitters from acting responsibly.
It's clearly a game of new economic hegemony developing, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional climate change advisor in Mexico and Central America for international nature conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would like to continue enforcing the legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most key participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate talks for the European Commission, said that the push by small island nations "has caused a political uproar to the entire policy process" in part because they are now united and demanding action from growing economies such as China and India.
Negotiations were called into question as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the remaining issues before the heads of government can negotiate a deal.
Senior officials such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister got off the planes and ran through the halls of the Bella Center to the closed doors of the meeting and new conferences so they could set out claims to be considered next week.
The full extent of the rally -- with 13,000 people moving in and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists staging ironic late-night shows about the countries they thought sent them, and hand-to-hand paper rather than e-mail-driven proposals -- was challenged.
The intensity is only a superstition: almost all the key ministers were present in Copenhagen and 60 heads of state were previously in the centre.
We've gotten into the high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the deputy minister for global policy at the International Conservation Fund.
Weighing heavily.
The first British train at 140 miles per hour redefined this Monday feeling
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistles went dark on the train's departure sign, which marked the transport revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach a speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford, Kent to London's St Pancras, crossing the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and joined the first high-speed passenger convoy outside London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international network of high-speed, reliable trains and connect the large Midlands, North and Scottish areas with London.
The absence of standing water should reduce travel times in passenger transport and on commercial roads and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
Theoretically, the three major political parties have been persuaded to adopt this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle for projects and concerns about environmental degradation have now halted the construction of Britain's high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasible study, submitted its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, the Times reported.
She provided him with a detailed map of the route of the next planned high-speed stage of the network.
The new London-West Midland route has been proposed within five metres of urban areas and neighbourhoods where access to the livelihood could be problematic.
In open landscape, a 25 m final route was planned.
HS2 also envisages three options for the extensive northbound high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped configuration where one high-speed line should lead to West Midland.
The road should be divided near Birmingham with one branch running from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other running northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One line should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most efficient choice has been made", said the railroad expert.
Once this is done, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
The proposals should allow trains to travel at 2250 miles per hour, making the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is already being designed to carry trains of 400 metres in length capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 files could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This means that the London terminal could handle up to 20,000 passengers per hour if necessary.
In view of the capital constraints, it is envisaged that the existing stations would be extended to include the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not come before the general election.
Even if it moves the wheels, the grid should be built in pieces.
Trains should not be operated on high-speed lines first, but on existing lines north of Birmingham and should maintain travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered a crucial point of contact for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a landmark for the revolution on the railways.
Taxpayers have paid off a £75,000 mortgage on the Tory Orange
Alan Duncan, the Tory front-seat MP, was paid thousands of pounds by taxpayers last year for the orange house he built in his constituency home.
The prison party spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "from the earnings", raised his mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak-lined extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds a month to taxpayers.
The local authorities approved the claims in time and he was not interviewed by Sir Thomasen Legg, who was in charge of checking the membership's expenditure.
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns two two-storey houses in the villages of his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth about a million pounds.
There's a kitchen, living room and dining room on the ground floor, but the finance department has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is designated an "orange garden".
Neighbors describe it as "a glass of fun and hospitality".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the final inspection by the Committee on Standards and Privileges in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had violated the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed his pupillary security to a mortgage of £27,1406 from his London estate to a house in his constituency he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week show Mr Duncan was claiming approximately £1,400 a month in mortgage interest up to March last year.
In April, his claims increased to over £1,800 a month.
The interest rate on the RBS mortgage payment of Mr Duncan could not change during this time, which suggests that all this was intended to finance a loan of £75,000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage payment fell from 7,94% in December 2007 to 4% in March of this year, remaining at that level.
The last municipal records show Mr Duncan continued to claim £1,250 a month in May this year.
Mr. Duncan resigned as the shadow House leader in September after a secret report filmed him saying MPs must survive "on a share" after the spending scandal.
"It's basically nationalized, you have to live on a quota and you're being treated like a fucking asshole".
He said, "I spent money on my garden and my claim and a small fraction on what was needed.
And I could claim all that damn share, but I won't".
The MP, a millionaire from a former oil merchant, was first called upon to explain his issues in May when it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the finance authority approved it, that "it could be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pound-shaped pit in Mr Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed he had claimed 4,000 pounds over three years.
When asked about the mortgage increase last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was due to the capital increase, which was approved by both the finance authority and Legg".
He added: "This is not a matter of concealment and clicking or breaking the rules or anything else.
It's absolutely straight down, by the rules, legitimate, and that's it.
There could be no cleaner or simpler way".
Come and have a look around the cottage on Brighton's coast with the Advent calendar.
The coastal huts in Brighton have found a new meaning in the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages the art of the living creatively, has invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December and use the Christmas carols as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to view the last chalet from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. each day, and bishop's bread and wine were served free of charge.
Selected Christmases included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, where the cottage featured the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a television marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-pension priest in the Diocese of Chichester and head of the Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important to people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we expect people to come to a foreign old building as a church?
"The idea of the Advent calendar in the cottages came about as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and vibrant place, and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way".
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding global warming agreement to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, and demonstrations were held around the world, including in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000, according to organizers, demonstrated in the chilly weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt an agreement that could enter into force by Friday, January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the Climate Conference, said that the growing global mobilization, as evidenced by the current demonstrations, contributed to the "political tax" of a possible failure in Copenhagen being too high.
According to AFP, incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the march began, when a group of about 300 protesters dressed in black began smashing the exposures with brick bricks and hammers.
The police force immediately took a heavy hit.
In total, police have announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-radical independent groups that had already appeared at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction", stressing that about a hundred were in chains and seats "held on the streets on Saturday evenings", despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the parade quietly headed for the Bella Center, where the talks were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to break in.
A stage was set up for the speakers, before which a candlelight meeting was held with the participation of former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were also large numbers of participants from Asia, including a few Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue robes, held their first gathering in Copenhagen in the early morning hours at the invitation of Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".
Today we take to the streets to demand a settlement of environmental debt in favor of the South, said Lida Nacpil, a Filipino fighter with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't say anymore: it's time for that, said the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
Rivers and streams are drying up in Africa, and we can walk in them today, and that's never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement for a different world has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he came to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice". "There is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world at the moment".
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly sensitive to warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people took to the streets, according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people marched, mostly students, wearing red clothes and gloves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators took to the streets demanding strong action against climate change.
Hundreds of people took part in the protests organised by the "350" movement in France, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
There were several dozen people in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia condemns it as "fraud"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, while Tbilisi has declared the move a "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the August 2008 Russo-Groatian War for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5pm GMT.
According to Abkhazia Election Commission officials, turnout was 58% a few hours before polling stations closed.
The first provisional results should be declared on Saturday night.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagash, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia that condemned the election.
These elections are a joke.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen to Russian rule", said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After seceding from Georgia, after the 1992-93 conflict that killed several thousand people, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said Kvarči Svetlana, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to having voted for President Bagash.
She was one of those who came to vote in the polling station at a school in the capital city of Suchumi, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian supremacy is a major issue in the presidential election in this region on the Black Sea coast that boasts beautiful nature.
In this small country of 216,000 people, huge billboards with Bagash are placed alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to observe the successful election process were warmly received by district mayor Beslan Arshby.
"We Abkhazians are grateful", he said at a small ceremony, with Moscow's support and especially its decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence in mind.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, drinking a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the election by former Vice President Raul Khadzhimba and two businessmen Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements signed last year with Moscow, such as a treaty that allows Russia to control Abkhazia's railway network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current government or opposition.
To win the election, you need a 50% majority plus one vote.
If no candidate achieves this result, the decisive contest shall be held within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations around the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding global warming agreement to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, and demonstrations were held around the world, including in Copenhagen, where police arrested about 700 people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000, according to organizers, demonstrated in a cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which is hosting delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, negotiating an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the parade quietly headed for the Bella Center, where the talks were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to break in.
A stage was set up for the speakers, before which a candlelight meeting was held with the participation of former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to AFP, the incidents occurred shortly after the march left, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began smashing the exposures.
The police immediately surrounded them and attacked without waiting, knocking several protesters to the ground.
In total, police have announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-radical independent groups that had already appeared at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
Late this afternoon, a policeman was hit by a tiled jaw and four cars were set on fire near a squat located near the incidents, which led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We're focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as police helicopters take to the air again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue coats, held their first gathering in Copenhagen in the early morning hours at the invitation of Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".
Today we take to the streets to demand a settlement of environmental debt in favor of the South, said Lida Nacpil, a Filipino fighter with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he came to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice". "There is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world at the moment".
Oxfam has invited some prominent figures, such as Danish model Helen Christensen and former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly sensitive to warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people took to the streets, according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated in front of the city hall in the capital of the Philippines, wearing red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
Several hundred demonstrators also met in Hong Kong and Jakarta demanding strong action against climate change.
Hundreds of people took part in the protests organised by the "350" movement in France, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
There were several dozen people in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general secondary school, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview with JDD on Sunday that history and geography subjects would be "enhanced" as part of the reform of general secondary schools, although their education will no longer be compulsory in the final year of the secondary school focusing on exact sciences.
Now all second-year students will have four hours a week and a common culture program for all, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "hypocrisy must be stopped", because he believes that the S-specialization is no longer focused on exact sciences" but "basically the best students are there".
The ES and L specialisations cannot be for S any kind of sub-specialization, he continues, stressing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would be bothered not to learn geography and history in the last year of vocational secondary education".
A survey by Ifop, published by Humanité on Saturday, showed that seven out of 10 French people (69%) disagreed with the government's proposal to abolish compulsory history and geography lessons in the senior year with a specialisation of 'S', and many intellectuals and teachers criticized the abolishment, both on the left and some members of the right.
The Minister added that it was "not in the mind" to abolish philosophy in the S-Graduate programme.
Luc Chatel also advocated reforms in teacher education, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for a Tuesday mobilisation against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future high school professors.
In the Master's programme 2 (M2) they will take an entrance exam focused on their subject at the beginning of the year and another exam at the end of the year to verify their teaching ability, the Minister explained.
They will take part in internships during the second year of their Master's degree and will act as a trainee professor in the first year.
If you add up all the internships that you'll be offered before the admissions process, you'll gain more experience with students, almost 300 hours, he continued.
The Minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which is not yet available in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite École normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince themselves about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the objectives of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the call made this morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (GIEC) at the initiative of the Ecole normale supérieure University in Ulm.
As one journalist told AFP, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the Ernest conferences, a one-day seminar of 15 minutes of expert input that will be recorded and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would appeal to people and make them more interested in learning, explained Eduard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of the seminar, which was named after a fish from a local pond that students named after them.
About twenty contributing experts from different scientific disciplines are selected and it is specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
"We can talk for hours about warming, but we can also summarize the basic goals in minutes", Jean Jouzel told AFP, speaking to 50 listeners without any pre-prepared notes, using only graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed, hoping that the audience will know that "the Copenhagen conference is based on very serious scientific foundations".
The videos of these lectures will be posted on the school's website from December 15.
The next Ernest seminar is scheduled for February, with more to follow, with regularity every two months.
Late payments: Angry prison guards, planned measures
On Friday, prison wards announced a 'general mobilization' to demand that they be paid Christmastime premiums and overtime, which were postponed until January for financial reasons.
Prison FO (2nd ward) asked non-duty staff to attend a demonstration outside the prison facilities on Tuesday morning to "block" them and thus alert them to "theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Overseers (third trade unions in this sector) called on them to "convene meetings in individual prisons and initiate a fundamental mobilization" as "shameful and unacceptable" so that "overtime and overtime pay for night work, Sundays and holidays" worked in October were not paid in December.
The first of the guards' unions, the Federal Union of Prison Guards (Ufap/UNSA), "called for a general mobilization . . . to express dissatisfaction and anger".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and not all of them are included in the financial budget, but they ensure that the amounts owed will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the prison wards' unions assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by the prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, the minister writes in her statement.
I have ordered the prison administration to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation created by the miscalculation of overtime is never repeated in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari added.
The December salary will therefore be low, except for managers who receive famous bonuses for performing their duties and achieving their objectives, says Ufap/Unsa, and for those "there is always room in the budget".
It's just a scandal, the F.O. in Marseille has been outraged and announced its decision to boycott the call for "all meetings and summonses".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays unless they are paid in December for these days of October, as well as overtime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
At a time when we are given more and more jobs and more tasks without having to be staffed, it is sad to let the lowest-ranking employees pay for it, says the CGT prison guards in Bordeaux.
The unions say the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any event, the funds are scarce, said Ufap Secretary-General Jean-François Forget.
Obama claims he gives "better presents" at Christmas than he gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to the screen "goddess" Oprah Winfrey that when it comes to gifts, she has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than I get".
The president and his wife Michelle spoke on a special broadcast on ABC Sunday night about how they plan to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged family companion, gets his cut.
The baby Jesus loves Bo too, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog will also "of course" receive a gift, as evidenced by excerpts from the preview.
And Michelle Obama also retaliated against her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she gets: "No, I gave you the first gift last year", she mocked the president.
Well, that's true, of course, he was forced to agree with the president, but then he jokingly pointed his finger at the first lady's pearl necklace and said, "Who gave you this?"
During this one-hour, very relaxed program with the famous presenter who worked tirelessly to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obama spouses also spoke to him about their favorite gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a 10-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father had given him for Christmas, which he rarely met.
I remember seeing my dad come to see us for Christmas and giving me the basketball, the president said.
It wasn't until much later that I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The first lady was again referring to the dollhouse.
I didn't know how to organize everything in the house, so I put all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday re-op, RTL reports he's in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles for "injuries" from a major operation he underwent in France, but his immediate family said the situation was "under control", while RTL reported that the singer was in artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "injuries resulting from surgery" to the scar tissue he sustained in Paris on November 26, his press office said in Paris, saying the injuries required "repair surgery".
However, the singer's press office tried to reassure the public, saying the situation was "under control", and also announced that a new medical statement would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the singer's main partner on his final tour, Johnny Hallyday was put to sleep to avoid "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll be a little more confident, RTL reports.
The press department, in response to AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that according to 'some sources' no drainage was located in Paris since the first operation.
Rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for a surviving placenta.
The surgery, which was scheduled for several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the arts.
But the doctor was not available to comment on RTL's information on Thursday.
After this surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection that occurred after the surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, told RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad period" but added that he was "not worried about the rock star" because he is a big "fighter".
He called me just before he left for L.A., but I told him he was doing something stupid, because spending 12 hours on a plane after an operation like this is no fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, singer-songwriter Jean-Claude Camus calmed the situation, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that the infection had been "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said he met Laetitia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
The singer's health problems have only increased since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had undergone surgery for a "small small intestine tumor" and then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, every single one of his health problems has been heavily monitored and commented upon, and fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving around on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to deny the report of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favourite discipline
Frenchman Frédéric Bousquet, three-time world champion in the 2009 big pool, won the title at the 2009 European Small Pool Championships in Istanbul on Thursday in a discipline he particularly likes: the 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championship, the last time a combination was allowed, only three world records were broken, although much more was expected.
One of them was overtaken by Hungarian sprinter Evelyn Verrasztova in the 200m and the other two by the men's Russian 4x50m relay team.
Big sadness for Bousquet, who set a world record in the 50m freestyle, which he already holds in a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two Royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, which was the first time ten swimmers started instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganj (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30), as he had expected.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if a world record was within my reach, I'd try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
The combinations have helped set 238 world records since February 2008, and their era ends in Istanbul, which first hosted the same competition in 1999.
Using the combination this time did not help the German, Paul Biedermann, a two-time world champion in the large pool in Rome in the summer, who held the world record for reaching the hand.
The young swimmer failed to break the record of 400-meter freestyle (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian runners Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything into that race.
I knew I wasn't going to break the world record this time, but I did manage to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious competitor in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: record of a Roman sarcophagus belonging to Zolo was sold for $1.5 million
A recording of a Romantic sarcophagus, owned by none other than French writer Emile Zola, was valued at $1.5 million on Thursday, a significantly higher than previous estimates, said an art dealer at Sotheby's.
The price of this two-meter-long, 60-foot-tall, third-century-century front-board was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysus scenes in elaborate architectural decoration surrounded by satire and bakshants is a rare work, there are very few like it in the world, perhaps four or five", Florent Heintz, vice-president of Sotheby's auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it's probably the most-attended item, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola bought this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The tablet was in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then gradually appeared in the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated a bathtub with it in her private hotel in Paris and Paul Reynaud, minister of the Third Republic in France and president of the Council shortly before Marshal Pétain came to power.
She's been shadowed there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz, while searching the Louvre museum database, found that this tablet was part of the "Restories of Emile Zola" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the frescoes of "Rougon-Macquart".
An aborted attempt to move President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday ruled that the conditions for the transport of the deposed Honduran president, Manuel Zelaya, who the rebels refused to guarantee a safe departure, were not met.
After a telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything so far suggests that there is no way to carry out this transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinos.
A Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya has taken off again, a source from the Directorate General for Migration said.
The coup government wanted to force President Zelaya to "resign" and to seek political asylum abroad, the only way to give him the opportunity to leave safely.
But the deposed president refused those demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as head of state in exile.
The coup government "hit another failure when they asked me to resign . . . they wanted me to resign", Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, often commenting on the political crisis that has been raging in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, the deposed president delivered, hidden in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a couple of chords.
The Mexican Embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee of safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the interior minister of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio station HRN on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with the Caracas-based Telesur station.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure mobilized a group of supporters of the deposed president who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, where the military increased security.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the coup government's stance.
They are thus showing their marginal attitude to international norms, he added.
Zelaya, who was close to socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was ousted on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election, against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of here, he will be arrested and held accountable for the crime of "treason" he is accused of, the coup government claims.
The coup d'état president Roberto Micheletti managed to organise a presidential election on November 29 to replace President Zelaya.
In the controversial election, recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries like Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, the U.S. trade balance is upbeat
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a surge, and U.S. trade balance sheet results show a surge in both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with a technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial commented.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on "half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focusing primarily on US trade balance figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October to $32.9 billion in September.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected the deficit to increase.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
A big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the economies of the United States' major trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
However, unemployment in the United States rose against all expectations last week, reaching the number of job applicants at 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants has dropped "to its lowest level this year", said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
The government's 10-year budget expenditure rose to 3,482% on Tuesday evening from 3,423% and the 30-year revenue rose to 4,492% on the previous day from 4,408%.
Cuba: Hundreds of pro-regime protesters chanted "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime shouted out Thursday to the wives of political prisoners who gathered in Havana on World Human Rights Day to prevent another demonstration that arrested dozens of dissidents.
About 40 "Ladies in White", wives or close political prisoners were pictured on the street by Raul Castro's regime supporters as they marched toward the capital's downtown to demand the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Along with the Yankees, "The soldiers!" "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!" "Long live Fidel and Raul!" were the shouts of the regime's supporters with their fists raised against dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who came to "ensure security".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" took place in Havana the day before, but no injuries or arrests were made.
But in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana, about 10 dissidents were detained by civilian police, who were also planning to march on Thursday for World Human Rights Day, AFP reported.
According to this journalist, the police used force to load dissidents who were whipped by government supporters into civilian vehicles.
The rule is that the arrest of dissidents under similar conditions only takes a few hours.
The 2005 European Parliament Sakharov Prize winners, "Dames in White", organized an unofficial march for the "release of all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opposition to be "soldiers" or "agents" paid by their arch-enemy, the United States.
Miracle finished, Cuban television reported on a demonstration on Thursday by supporters of the government regime against "resisters of the revolution".
Cuba, with a Communist Party at its head and a one-party government policy, has been regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disregarding human rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
A lunatic stabbed an 80-year-old man and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A lunatic armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during a peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary investigation, the 28-year-old assailant allegedly attacked a two-stabbed and unknown reasons 80-year-old man in or near a pharmacy on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, police and witness accounts.
A severely wounded old gentleman, born in 1929, died of his injuries, according to the Alliance Police Syndicate in a hospital.
In this pharmacy or in front of it, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
My husband, in his early 30s, started defending himself and was wounded.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where the 80-year-old died.
The life of the second victim is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently compromised.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to hospital "in shock", a police source said.
A gunman, apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, a police source said, then fled into the street, still on Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
He wounded two other people, apparently by accident, a 30-year-old man and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
How this all happened is not entirely clear, since it all happened in the evening hours.
He was armed with two butcher knives, carrying a cross behind his back, said the leader of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, testified to AFP that they tried to stop and disarm the lunatic.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commented Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd rushed to him, including a city cop who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to detain a gunman and were wounded in the fists, a police source said.
The incident occurred on one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
The scouts came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and noticed large wounds on his stomach, told AFP Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, another person in his 30s arrived, who also had stab wounds.
A man who had no ID was later arrested by state police.
The Nanterre prosecutor has referred the case to the Hauts-de-Seine District Police Investigative Division (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to the hospital Thursday night.
He's in custody awaiting questioning.
Police source did not rule out his being in a psychiatric ward.
Another police source said it took six officers to handle him at the Clichy police station, where he was transported.
He was "totally out of his mind" as "all the crazy ones of this type whose power increases tenfold in action".
USA: Polish lawyer again requests to end prosecution
The lawyer of Polish-French director Roman Polanski again asked for a stay of criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence, on Thursday in Los Angeles, California, for a moral affair that occurred 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the film director's attorney, has been critical of the serious mistakes made in the prosecution of the "Pianist" film at the time of the events in 1977 before three judges of the California Court of Appeal.
I demand a halt to the prosecution now and immediately, said lawyer Hummel, adding that the conduct of the judge who ruled the case at the time, Laurence Rittenbanda, "had a cold in his back".
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) had reportedly had to deal with a prosecutor before delivering the sentence, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison  which is a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", from the mouth of the Prosecutor, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally admitted late September that he had "sacrificed" the author of the document.
If the court refuses to stay the proceedings, lawyer Hummel will request a trial in which he can present evidence of his claim.
The applicant repeated what was already said in the first instance, namely that no serious examination of the application for stay of proceedings will take place until Roman Polanski is brought to trial.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978 before the court issued a verdict in the case of "illegal sexual intercourse" with a minor girl aged 13.
He has never re-entered the United States since.
Los Angeles deputy district attorney Phyllis Asayam said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial".
In this case, we want to inform not only Roman Polaski but also other defendants that there is a possibility of escape, asks Mrs Asayam.
He believes the director "asks the court for a favor and at the same time disregards its authority".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to rule, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Attorney Hummel was not the only one who asked for the suspension of the prosecution of Roman Polanski.
Victim's lawyer, Samantha Geimer, has also again requested the termination of the criminal prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate the perpetual harassment every time the Polanski case emerged, adding: "No one in this room can say the trial was fair".
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on the orders of the United States.
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to house arrest in his hut in Gstaad, where he awaits possible exoneration.
Wall Street is losing direction, it's getting blocked by the rising dollar.
The New York Stock Exchange closed down on Friday with the market swirling between indicators that are better than expected in the US and the rising dollar price: The Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with a technological dominance, dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index increased from 0,37% (4,06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
To be honest, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It's still in a tight range, the volume of trade has declined very much, and I think it's going to stay that way until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators that "helped improve the mood of the market in terms of stability of the economic recovery", analyst Charles Schwab summarized.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row, and far more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate from the University of Michigan Index, U.S. consumer confidence also returned, rising sharply to 73.4 in December, compared with 67.4 the previous month.
However, the indexes have been hampered by a new rise in the dollar's price against the euro, which is the highest in two months, "pushing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation", said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Tech stocks are losing ground.
The stock market has fallen.
The State Treasury yields for 10 years increased to 3,540% compared to 3,482% on Wednesday evening and for 30 years increased to 4,497% compared to 4,492% the day before.
Miss World again in the South African Republic.
After a month-long journey across South Africa, 112 Miss World contestants are set to cross their dream goal on Saturday: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world by a billion television viewers.
This is the second year the grand beauty celebration has been held in the vicinity of Johannesburg, and five candidates have so far qualified for the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were chosen as Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had so many experiences!
The contest, which is now in its ninth edition in South Africa, will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5pm (15pm).
I could not have dreamed of a more beautiful land where I would wear a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm lucky to have been able to experience it twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhin confided in the hot southern summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "breath-breathing landscape".
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press briefings and safari, Miss is now focusing on the contest itself.
India Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also contested the election with Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winners who both became Bollywood stars.
To be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to return home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th anniversary will be in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will be introduced in traditional costumes and, of course, swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese television presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is difficult to cope with, said Miss World President Julia Morley.
As last year, the candidates took part in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
A special occasion was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Unusual for the president, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
The most memorable event will be the draw in Cape Town, Southwest, for the World Cup in June 2010, which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I'm sure I'll be back for the 2010 World Cup, says Alice Taticchi, with enthusiasm Miss Italy.
David's son says the reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive".
The news of Johnny Hallyday's condition is "very positive", his son David assured us on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
"It's very strong and everything is going very well", said David Hallyday, disembarking from a plane he was flying from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 a.m.
The singer's son, who was calm, said he would be "as soon as possible" at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where John Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a post-operative infection caused by surgery on his circumcised interbracial bladder, which he underwent on November 26 in Paris.
According to a press release, the night singer was "put to sleep" in Los Angeles for comfort, to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was already put to sleep by Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, after an infection following surgery for a torn intervertebral palsy in Paris on November 26.
Due to the serious damage caused by this impact, the singer had to undergo surgery again on Wednesday night.
According to AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a French high school performance in Los Angeles on Friday morning, which their daughter Jade attends.
The head of the orthopedic surgery and trauma department at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catone, has announced that he will be flying to Los Angeles to see the singer on Monday.
The producer has strongly accused Dr. Stephen Delajoix, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons have declared themselves outraged, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes Johnny Hallyday "went too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Paris surgeon".
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone, and he assured me that this trip was not a problem, which surprised me greatly, since I myself had already twice been threatened with a spinal cord injury, he added.
A moment earlier on RTL radio, he said that the singer apparently left after the Paris operation without a drain, without anything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was working at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma caused by a brain hemorrhage.
He is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times of neglect, tax evasion and fraud.
Medical Chamber lawyer Olivier Metzner described him as a "man without scruples" who is "regularly" summoned to the medical chamber and who cannot even be "remarkably recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stephen Delajoux spoke on the matter through his lawyer, David Koubbi, on Friday.
He reported that the procedure had "gone very well" and that the post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic in nature, so the drainage was not necessary", he added.
The singer's health problems have been increasing since this summer, and in any case, it seems his next tour will remain questionable.
It is clear that the deadline for the renewal of the planned tour on January 8 (in Amiens, note) seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF is raising the tone and calling on the Nouveau Centre party not to use their abbreviation any longer.
The UDF, controlled by MoDem Francois Bayroua, on Friday responded to the attempt by Nouveau Centre President Hervé Morin to take over the shortcuts of former Giscard party by saying that it must not use the shortcuts in any media under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to take over the short form UDF, saying François Bayrou does not deserve to carry her legacy after he has handed over his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, was scheduled to confirm the strategy before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC) movement on Saturday.
This move was supported by Hervé de Charetta (former MP for UMP now NC), who claims ownership of the UDF brand, having first registered it with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF Association committee, led by friend François Bayrou, who had no intention of being expropriated, stepped out of their silence and formally requested the minister and MPs to stop using the acronym and hand over trademark ownership, under threat of prosecution.
In recent days you have raised a worrying statement that you will propose to your political movement to take over the abbreviation UDF, the Association writes in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance centriste.
You also considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name +Nouveau centre+, with the slogan +UDF Today+, also note the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF Committee, which asks the NC movement to "immediately remove all mention of the UDF name from all promotional materials, including (its) websites".
It also requests Hervé de Charette 'to transfer the ownership of the mark to the legitimate owners'.
If you do not, we will turn to the courts to ensure that the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members are respected, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr Morin and his friends "opted" to leave in 2007 "to create a competing movement, like others in 2002, to establish the UMP.
The Nouveau Centre therefore has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for a three-year term and to set up a committee to defend the 'moral and material interests' of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the Committee continues, 'when he registered the trade mark, he had not been a member of the UDF for three years, but of the UMP.
He used the non-existent registration of acronyms in a scandalous and fraudulent way to do so on his own account.
This inaction begins to turn into a crime, they declare, and then they ironically express themselves to NC strategy: "We think that in politics and in everyday life it is more valuable to make a name for ourselves than to go out of anonymity by fraudulently accepting a name to which we have no right".
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of his position of weakness.
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to try artist François-Marie Bannier and rule on whether he used the frailty of an 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of a share of her fortune, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames on him.
The photographer, 62, known for his celebrity photographs, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of his position of vulnerability, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision confirms that a trial will indeed take place in what can be described as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother and daughter attack each other and fight for control of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered an 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt's medical examination to be conducted by a three-doctor college.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the public prosecutor's office in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 and comment on whether and during what period Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think he's going to get it.
I'll talk to her about it, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
As regards the lawyer of François Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, the court's decision was welcomed.
It's excellent news... and expertise shows that he manipulated this old lady who needs protection, Mr. Banier, confirmed.
It's been two years since Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter launched a criminal case against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multi-artist who accuses him of using her mother's frailty for years to get a billion euros in checks, life insurance contracts or masterpieces.
Liliane Bettencourt, on the other hand, has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer she considers her long-time friend.
While the court had to consider the merits of the lawsuit filed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' Friday court speech had for a moment turned into a family hour of truth.
The lawyer of Liliana Bettencourt submitted three letters to her notary by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) expressing her distrust of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt, according to her lawyer, adds, "Could you explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier once or twice a day for 15 years.
Since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Francois".
The Prosecutor's Office in Nanterre has again found that the complainant's actions are unjustified, in particular that the custodial judge has recently rejected her application to open proceedings for the grant of legal protection to her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt 'is fully capable of attending the court, not under protection or custody.
No one else will act on her behalf", said Prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court finally decided that the Court would give its opinion on the validity of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers at the time of the opening of the proceedings.
The managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
Unless the French corporate governance changes, our struggle to develop economic intelligence has been futile...
For more than a decade, the management of large companies has been reminiscent of the approach taken by firms towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about associates identifying themselves with 'values' that are defined from the top down, as it was before when it was necessary to impose on consumers products that came from the ideas of the main factory technicians.
By making the customer the center of the business, the marketing revolution has shifted the strategy of market capture in the right direction... although authoritarian efforts to impose products different from the customer's preferences are regularly returning!
Passive employee attitudes can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that affects mainly management.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI 'requires an active approach and a predictive capacity from all stakeholders' and requires commitments from employees that are completely contrary to the revenues of authoritarian management.
We therefore call for a managerial revolution that aims to put workers at the center of the enterprise's interests as well as the client's.
The relative usefulness of internal public opinion surveys.
Will internal public opinion polls, like the questionnaire submitted to Orange employees, contribute to a revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mostly because I've already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure will, after different twists, return preferably to what it always did!
Moreover, authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of one's own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they're graduates of engineering colleges, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of convenience, they are learning an old behavioural theory, now revived by "neuroscientists" from the United States and widely circulated without further knowledge by scientific institutions and the media.
With the possibility of "swinging the levers" (sic) of managers' involvement, a recent survey by Ipsos on Figaro.fr showed that managers are only positioned in a mechanical control position unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution, necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, involves the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating basic care into all management purposes and practices: Employees will only be able to commit to the company if they are seen as a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, only studies on motivational functional analysis deal with this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their undertakings on the basis of a pre-defined document that allows them, through an image that reflects the undertaking, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life objectives.
By identifying and measuring these mobilisation factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their 'social performance' and put their human resource management 'on track'.
It thus provides a breeding ground for the development of sound and efficient economic intelligence.
With the speech from Oslo: "Justice War" Obama earned praise from the right.
The American right on Friday welcomed a speech by Barack Obama the day before in Oslo, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner had defended the concept of a "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who first mocked Obama's award on October 9 applauded the presidential speech this time, including Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Palin, a muse for the right-wing Republican wing, to USA Today, adding that she herself expressed the "sometimes necessary" theme of war in her memories, which are just beginning.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans want to have to work on, but it's necessary.
All the terrorists should be detained there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo excused the deployment of troops and used the speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president did "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who especially appreciated the president's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I thought this speech was entirely historic, Gingrich said in an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, considered by some to be a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see the "leftwing president" remind members of the Nobel committee that "they themselves would not be free and could not pass on the peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former speechwriter for George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a "very American speech".
Not only did he present himself as a "world citizen" as always, but he "spoke like an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble they did not create and that they do not do too much to maintain it", Gerson said.
Among the few left-wing dissatisfied are Bush-era hardliner, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, who described the speech as "unique, uninspiring and uninspiring", according to the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, for example, Democrat Dennis Kucinich is horrified to see Barack Obama justify using force.
"When we wrap war in the envelope of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people", he warned.
However, the centre-left press has a very positive view of the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times still considers the award of the Obama Peace Prize premature, it has called his performance an "over-performance" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression", enthusiastically reports the California Daily.
Obama "made the speech that was needed", reviewed the New York Times, and called it "simple and instructive".
Road transport: three marathons to a deal that will save Christmas supply.
After three negotiating marathons, the road transport unions and TLF, the only employer organisation to stay until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ended the call for a strike and the threat of supplying supplies for Christmas.
Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed "delight" at Friday's signing of the agreement, following several negotiations that began Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions, the negotiators left early Friday morning hoping to sign the text of the agreement as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
This is despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have withdrawn from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting that started at 11:00 to get everyone to agree and at 6:00 to sign the agreement.
This conflict "would greatly hurt businesses" and "threaten the risk of disruption of holidays at the end of the year", Bussereau said.
The text of the text includes a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wage earners (local and regional road transport) and a 2,9% increase in wages for the highest wage earners (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest wage is increased from EUR 8,72 to EUR 9,06.
It's not much, but it's a lot of effort, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
Tonight we will order our members to stop the blockade, no blockade of the supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied", he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed the 'right deal', although it was difficult to admit the high wage increases given the international competition'.
He believes that there will be an increase of EUR 170 per month for the lowest wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
It is a common sense and respect agreement for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an 'acceptable compromise'.
The agreement also provides for a 3% revaluation of travel expenses and a road transport status report for the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the 13th salary question and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "100 million euro reduction in corporate payroll taxes" that was the subject of the government's proposal to amend the 2009 budget bill, which was voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government is asking the Senate for a "contract" vote.
The signing allows for this agreement to apply first to undertakings that are members of this organisation, and later to the whole industry, in the event of an extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will be done "within the shortest possible time", Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only be stopped by disagreement between employers' organisations.
FNTR speaks of 'bad trade' as EUR 100 million 'has already been offered to the sector as part of the carbon tax compensation'.
The Secretary of State for Transport compelled us to make an emergency move, not because of mutual analysis, but to avoid irritating the crow-eaters during the coming Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
The Otre organisation is threatened by the agreement over the next 12 months to 'burial a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector'.
RER A suburban trains: weekend traffic interruption, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP.
The suspension of services on the RER A suburban train line, France's largest urban public transport route, will continue over the weekend as Friday's negotiations between the unions and the RATP leadership on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results on the question of the premium claim.
On Saturdays and Sundays, which are important shopping days before Christmas, trains will only run between 10 and 8 p.m. and on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every other train, except for one of four trains.
The SNCF will be disconnected in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
The Galeries Lafayette retailers, which expect over 200 000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that 'RATP sought to ensure connectivity with large retailers'.
The RER A line runs from west to east of the Paris metropolitan area.
The section managed by RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was at peak operation and virtually no sets were running at off-peak as planned.
As on Thursday, the people of Ile de France were organized differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning, there were far fewer people at the station in Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, partly because there were no students and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29, of Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), explained that he got up "an hour and a half early to make sure he was on time".
The Saint-Lazare reservoir was not overcrowded, the SNCF State Railways announced, as a higher number of crews and security guards was predicted.
The suburban trains RER A operated by SNCF to or from Cergy-Le-Haut came or left from Saint-Lazare station with a metro connection.
The next general meeting of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday to assess the results of the Friday afternoon meeting with the management, which the unions rated as 'weak'.
The RER management proposes to negotiate a special protocol for RER A suburban trains in all aspects, adjusting working hours, career paths, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who claim a well-deserved prize, according to Thierry Garon (Southern Association).
RATP even suspended the premium proposals for the time being, which worsened the CGT by saying that management 'was not able to solve the problem, while the carriers and SNCF were able to do so'.
The new meeting, scheduled for Monday, will 'examine closely the conditions of the profession', the RATP clarified.
Which is why the union thinks the company is "making fun of weekend passengers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers were seized by the business committee at his Paris headquarters.
The management, which has so far refused to discuss any of the strikes, therefore decided to meet in order to "calm down".
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to RER B on Tuesday after Unsa and the Independent announce a strike emergency.
The unions are demanding premiums of between EUR 120 (Unsa) and EUR 150, of which EUR 30 are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independents)) and are taking advantage of the deteriorating working conditions on this line which carries one million passengers a day.
RER suburban train drivers earn EUR 2200 to EUR 2700 in gross wages and EUR 600 to EUR 650 in premiums for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and holidays in the later stages of their careers.
The Turkish judiciary has dissolved the Kurdish party and this decision has serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday to abolish the country's main pro-Kurdish party, prompting protests and demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast and Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government's task of trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become "a nest of activities threatening the state's independence and indivisible unity", Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, which required a majority of seven votes to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party officials, including its president Ahmet Turk and MP Aysela Tuglukova, were banned from participating in political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tuglukova and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 500).
The party leadership had already warned before the ruling that MEPs would rather leave Parliament than act as MPs without political competence.
The decision is a continuation of a trial initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "orders" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "basic link" to the PKK, but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes as the government extends a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and offers a series of measures to strengthen their rights and try to limit Kurdish support for the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the party's dissolution could lead to a renewed tension in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is being detained in recent weeks have been staged in clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the verdict, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast, mostly Kurdish.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, and protesters threw Molotov cocktails or shot stones from their trousers.
A hundred people demonstrated in Istanbul as well.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the ruling would only "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, note, ed.) by banning the party, he said in a press release.
The government, which is made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We're against the principle of party interference.
It's not a solution, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete departure from the democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK joined one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, killing seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow may come
A nice, crumbling winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the FES winter technical services department.
But so his staff can test and learn to control all vehicle technology.
Weather forecasts say it could happen for the first time this weekend.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are on hand to take care of the snow and ice.
The ESF is, however, following a precise plan.
Once the snow in Frankfurt is all over the place and the temperatures drop below zero, they'll go to 20 so-called "sections A" of the iceberg, Brauburger explains.
These sections include main and passenger tracks such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire departments, suburban public transportation lines, pedestrian zones and slopes like Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at 3:00 in the morning.
If necessary, a maximum of three hours should be spent spraying the best-holding wet salt for some 1,40 km.
That's why the FES starts at 3 o'clock at night, "to make the roads clear when the traffic starts".
It's not easy when it doesn't start snowing until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the Winter Technical Services Department, "because no one is willing to make room for the squirrels".
Only when it doesn't snow so much is there a line of access and connections, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, FES footmen will set off, cleaning up hazardous areas and crossings.
The FES can't usually take care of all the cycling tracks.
There's a special service in Frankfurt that monitors the bridges from 10 p.m. to 4:30 a.m., Brauburger says.
Because they form rapidly, the ice sheet is released as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police will call them if necessary.
The nest of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-foot-long, six-foot-tall animal ran along two strong hind limbs, had a long skull with sharp, crooked teeth, short front limbs with curved claws, and a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be anything special.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in the Thursday edition of Science magazine write that the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these physical features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent of Pangea.
Tawa is opening a new window into the earlier evolution of the dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It tells us a lot about the kinship relationships, the spread and the early dinosaur traits.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, unprecedented for triassic settlements, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The find confirms the theory of the early history of the dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are very rare, usually only found in individual fragments".
Other dinosaur experts share this enthusiasm without question.
This finding is not particularly impressive, but it does confirm some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the pradinosaur classification is often disputed.
For example, experts discuss when lizards split into three major developmental lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and birds, the "long-legged" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the herbivores Ornithischia (the tetrapods), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is the original therapist, analyzed by Nesbit and his colleagues.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, Nesbitt says.
For example, researchers found evidence of air sacs in the skull of the Tawa hallae, which are also the descendants of the theropod birds.
Thanks to air bags, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
At the Tawa Hallae, the spinal bones were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related lineage of giant sauropods later also had air sacs and light bones, this useful innovation was probably created by a common ancestor of the two groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists have speculated that lizards first appeared there.
Accordingly, the three lines of development split early and spread from South America to all the continents that then formed the unified landmass of the supercontinent Pangaea.
The fact that the team found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods along with the Tawa hallae speaks for itself.
The three cannot be descended from a common, immigrant ancestor, scientists argue.
We believe that there have been at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, a member of the heaviest dinosaur group, lived in what is now Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His guess could add up to a distorted picture, because in South America, very many primitive dinosaur fossils have survived, and they are rarely found on other continents.
How dinosaurs proved that they evolved from a relatively rare ancestral lineage of reptiles into the dominant vertebrates on Earth during the Middle Ages remains a mystery.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
By the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs had spread around the world and many new species had evolved, while relatives died out and the Triassic and Jury interfaces.
The success story didn't last forever.
There are two hypotheses for explaining this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but not the reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better so they could push out the competition.
The success story didn't last forever anyway.
150 million years later, the meteorite impact helped another group of animals that also evolved in the Triassic and has been living in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, or Berkeley, California.
They have joined faculty from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin, or Bremen.
The police clearing of the occupied Frankfurt Goethe University casino has caused a worldwide stir.
278 professors and lecturers at Goeth University, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the presidential-instigated police intervention.
Because the walls and artwork were crowded, the university president, Werner Müller-Estler, had the building that had been occupied by students and lecturers on strike last week, cleared.
Five students were injured.
The damage to the case, the signatories say, does not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching by students and police commanders".
The removal represents an 'unacceptable interference' with the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "illogise and criminalize protest" and distracts attention from content.
The Presidium has avoided the necessary discussion.
The speakers call for an end to the criminal prosecution.
It is alleged that most strikers did not support material damage.
A legitimate protest
The Verdi Youth Trade Union and the German Trade Union Union also stand in solidarity with the students.
Protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one's own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hessian Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is currently defending the university president's and police's actions.
We owe it to the president of the university.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said Thursday in Aktuellen Stunde (Current Time) in the Wiesbad Land Council.
We have an understanding of protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said MP Peter Beuth of the CDU.
Otherwise, the opposition factions SPD, Greens and the Left saw it.
The CDU takes the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, the clearing took place.
Linke has submitted a proposal calling on the Home Secretary to report on the police deployment.
The new Silicon Valley
For years, it was a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a heavily guarded site for covert weapons research.
Today, this district of 216,000 people, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, the representatives of the Greenland Region have been in contact with the Riedberg Science Centre in Frankfurt - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several visits were made and on Wednesday, in Frankfurt, Zelenograd and Ridberg signed the "Protocol on close cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Zelenograd Prefect Anatoliy Smirnov, signed for Frankfurt by the leading planning consultant Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs involved in natural science research will attend a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
It's a continuous scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be allowed to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian science companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally translated as "Green City") got its name from the forested hilly landscape in which research facilities are planted.
The braking system of Stuttgart
The size of Stuttgart 21 cannot be prepared enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply a 'new heart of Europe'.
Okay. S21 is more than a station launch, more than a monstrous construction that will throw the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a decade of desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the '80s.
The main railway stations that ended in the city centre were then considered 19th-century transportation and engineering fossils that act as brakes on modern rail transport, as it took enormous time to overtake the locomotive from the rear forward.
Stop, stop, move on, that's how it should work.
And that's why the main stations disappear: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station that is about halfway between the trans-European railway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan "the heart of Europe".
It really starts with the S21, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian cities, construction was almost impossible to start.
Since modern shuttle trains with motor and steering vehicles have been available at both ends, the main stations have no problems with entering and exiting.
Still: Starting with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE route to Ulm.
It was imposed by the rural and communal politicians.
The roads cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state group.
Urbanistally, the project can be excused in some other way.
A new urban space will be created that - if we trust the computer graphics of the designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the railway transport system.
The passenger stations and the construction of the line are designed for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights back then.
Modern transport policy must, however, be primarily about strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is far greener than road freight transport.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to the rapid rise.
More importantly, S21 is indirectly involved in many other railway projects.
In Switzerland, six billion euros were to be buried.
That's the official number.
Experts estimate it to be between 10 and 15 billion.
It's clear that there will be a lack of funding for other nodes and narrow spots in the network in the coming decades.
There are 60 more projects on the Department of Transport's list.
One of the most important is the construction of a route of some 180 kilometers [180 miles] through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the route has been built at a slower pace.
This is where you need to push hard.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The Rhine Valley will become the heart of the international freight transportation bottle: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the airport ruling.
The Land Government has left open the Wiesbad Land Council whether to appeal the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night-time flight ban and to have it reviewed.
The CDU/FDP coalition has instructed experts to legally assess more than 400 pages of the VGH judgment, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassel today argued in writing that the State would have to re-adjust the nighttime flight ban in the event of the planned construction of the north-west runway of Frankfurt Airport.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 11pm and 5am, as the country's government assumes, is not in line with the law's protection of the population from nighttime air traffic noise.
The Coalition must decide by January 4 whether to seek a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticized the delay and urged the government representative to withdraw the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD chief Torsten Schafer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to reiterate their pledges to ban night flights, which they had made before the election.
It's a hell of a lot harder if you can keep your word, said Green Party chief Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's campaign slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's accusation that the country's government is trying to get to its night flights through "wrong law and trickery".
Precise legal control takes its time.
The coalition doesn't want to work on a "first impression" basis.
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction's statement on the night-fly ban was never the opposition's.
American banks are paying off the aid
American, crisis-stricken big banks are getting rid of government bonds.
Bank of America on Wednesday repaid a total of $45 billion in assistance from the Tarp Banking Rescue Fund (about 30 billion euros).
According to the US broadcaster CNBC, Citigroup also plans to repay the state aid.
The constitutions thus seek to remove the limitations imposed by the receipt of money - the restriction on the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America has secured $19 billion in net assets from investors through exchangeable bonds.
The rest of the money was taken from her treasury, which was filled, among other things, by trade union sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday night expressly thanked the American taxpayer for saying that the money injection helped us through a difficult time.
The financial institution was hurt at the height of the financial crisis by the acquisition of Merrill Lynch Investment Bank.
Citigroup wants to relieve itself of its obligations to the State by also acquiring money on the capital market.
CNBC cited sources as saying that the US bank may have announced a capital increase of around $20 billion on Thursday.
Citigroup's spokesman declined to comment.
In June, the aid was paid off by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
The rapid choice
It was faster than expected.
The station introduced its successor just two weeks after the ZDF board of directors expelled editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender.
Last night, the grime tried to negotiate a deal on that person.
The favorite was Peter Frey, head of ZDF's studio in the capital city of Berlin.
The station hasn't confirmed it - officially, to avoid a trial.
However, they also did not want to harm ZDF intendant Marcus Schächter if the proposal was not passed by the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The results of the vote were not known before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed on the board with his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Brender's loss of the mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, though it was expected.
The EU's majority on the Governing Council signaled a few weeks before the elections that it did not want to confirm Brender.
The resistance to the editor-in-chief was organized by the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the office of a highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that the ZDF news broadcasting quotas had been reduced under Brender.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
Last time, 35 state lawyers even intervened in the debate, who consider Koch's case unconstitutional.
It was useless.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
Then he worked for the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal reference of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and moderator of "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 foreign policy director of ZDF; since then director of the main studio of ZDF.
After Brender, who was chosen by Medium Magazine's professional journalist of the year on Wednesday, was fired, the Greens announced they were filing a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's running mate, the Rhineland-Palatinate prime minister, Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should amend the state treaty with the ZDF so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF's supervisory boards.
Brender's intended successor, Peter Frey, gave the board a clever chess move - and immediately after Brender's ouster, he was heavily criticized by the grimm.
This proof of journalistic independence allowed him to nominate him as editor-in-chief without losing a face like Schächter, so he could be elected by the board of directors without suspecting that a party member would be pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is, after all, a left-wing liberal.
Studying is getting rid of the mess
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes, the Ministers of Culture finally arrived in the Federal States on Thursday: At a conference of Ministers of Culture and University Rectors, both sides agreed on their willingness to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to complete their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of examination: in principle, each study module should be completed with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of students should be controlled and 'a real and fair standard' should be guaranteed.
To this end, politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Federal States undertake to create a more flexible common structural task for undergraduate and postgraduate studies.
Earthly deviations should cease to exist.
Less testing
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the ministers of culture and the university rectors have been saying wings on better education.
Now, for the first time, they're filled with specific content.
The Accreditation Council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations in part: "Each module will normally be completed by only one examination", states the 30-page report, which is intended to partly re-regulate the approval of study areas.
"By significantly lowering the test load", said the president of the accreditation board, Reinhold Grimm, "the faulty development that significantly reduced the difficulty of the study is to be stopped".
This is to be the 'study complexity' of the future 'decisive criterion' in implementation.
Modules and content must be "cruelly checked" so that "students are not unnecessarily restricted in their choice of
The following are the results of the seminars:
Students should be entitled to "a space that allows and supports their own initiative".
The rules shall apply to the approval of new fields of study, after review, but also to existing fields of study.
These need to be 're-accredited' every five years  which means that it will take until 2015 for all fields of study to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany are responsible for this, subject to accreditation councils established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Culture urged the federal states "strongly" to act on the agencies so that the school's capacity is not too high and the exam schedule is not strict.
In each of the Länder, universities and colleges have already agreed with the Länder on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
The university should mainly finance consultancy and study counselling programmes and strengthen the examination and foreign offices.
Countries and universities are looking to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to take the government and put a new university law in parliament.
It considers that only one single examination should be required to complete the study module.
The training of students should be even more flexible, ensuring that exams from other universities are accepted and making it easier to obtain a master's degree.
By the end of next year, the demand for all fields of study in the country should be checked.
The government and opposition again discussed the conditions for study in the country on Thursday.
The resolution was also criticized.
The Federal Council of the Juso University groups called for the formation of education policy not to take place "behind closed doors" in the future by ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, students should "say at least a word" as the affected persons.
Future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of Rectors of Universities (HRK), Margreta Wintermantelová: "We need the experience of students", she said at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture on Thursday, with whom HRK discussed a joint reform report.
According to the Education and Science Boards (GEW), the Bonn Resolution did not go far enough: they demand a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor's degree to access postgraduate studies.
Second, the federal countries must ensure that there are enough places available tomorrow for the current generation of undergraduate students in master's degrees with the best possible study conditions, said Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW board.
The federal government needs to employ far more lecturers.
But the Ministers of Culture have not commented on the free access to the master's programmes.
More than a footnote to the Hertha Müller
Getting into Germany and out is nice, almost no control"... is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, who in this fragmented piece of language thematizes the experience of a dissent who gained freedom but at the same time lost his language environment.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner Söllner worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children's book publishing house, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he lectured in poetry at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A significant non-literary stir was raised last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the shattered mirror of its security acts".
Söllner, apparently uncertain and infected, left a statement in which he admitted to cooperating as a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service Securitate in front of fellow Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In 1989, together with some of those present, Söllner was awarded the German Language Prize.
The recruitment efforts were said to have begun in a subtle way, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner continued, "then someone who has not resisted enough attempts at intimidation by the Securitate".
The poet Werner Söllner is secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Hertha Müller and her unprecedented literary handling of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German writers from Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depth and shame of a political system based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is not only the perpetrator, but he is also the victim.
Secret agent Walter played a role in the Securitate files, after Söllner's confession, Michael Markel, and he referred to the positive influence of secret agent Walter on himself.
"He was cutting me up" in all the things that were important to him back then, says Markel.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
Söllner's statement in this form and in front of this public was unexpected, but it is not surprising that the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service have admitted.
Herta Müller wrote back in July, when she read her own 914-page file, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Securitate's spies.
The touch, it is assumed, will speculate and in some cases even know which name is behind the cover name of Sorin, Voic and Walter.
Other than the domestic, meanwhile, very confident review of Stazi's components, the handling of the Securitate's control remains highly diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been marred and limited.
One of the Birthler offices, which is responsible for the National Council for Securitate Processing (CNSAS), was only established in 1999, and the issuance of the act has been taking place for quite some time since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of files.
The fact that former Securitate members still have a strong influence in Romania was confirmed by an interview after the Nobel Prize was awarded to Hert Müller, in which one of the former Securitate heads from Temeșvar refused to acknowledge the winner.
She says she has psychosis, after all, she's only been questioned once.
The suppression of power has been expressed here in the form of free speech.
Of course, the Söllner case, as in the case of the covert offence, involves inevitable questions.
The peculiar reaction of the audience to Söllner's confession makes it expected that the continuation of this chapter will determine more the desire for knowledge than the confession of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herty Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it's more than a footnote.
The full contribution of the Champions League
It looked like a clean-clothed salesman was coming from a cute Christmas party handing out sweets to a sports goods manufacturer as he boarded a midnight quarter in a codenamed C-class Mercedes with new VfBr coach Christian Gross in a sponsored orange bag. ̈
A man with a prominent dance style has been driven to a foreign city for him.
Otherwise he could drive alone - alcohol was not in the game, and the 55-year-old drunk with happiness was too small.
It was a nice evening, but he's going to continue working tomorrow.
Or it's just getting started.
The words of the committed Swiss just three days ago: "We have reached the semi-finals", in the Champions League with a 3-1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal struggle against relegation".
"A far more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It's important to repeat the performance of the royal class in Moghuk on a regular league day.
And to avoid another obvious weakness after three quick goals by Marica (5), Träsche (8), and Pogrebnyaka (11).
The following shall be added:
The Champions League Eight Final (match 16/17. + 23/24 February/ replay 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be played on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's thrilling ascension will thus be preserved.
Not just a supposed doctor who in a short time gave uncertain Stuttgart professionals confidence, willingness to commit and joy of the game.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and urged them to be more courageous, explaining to the soul healer Gross a simple-sounding, successful recipe that, under Babbel's guidance, has not proven effective.
Inspired by a certain kind of magic, Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, admitted, "when a new impulse comes to football, sometimes things happen that you would not think possible".
Sami Khedira, who after a week-long injury break has become the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the "phenomenon" by the proverbial "fresh wind" and the new manager's work practices: "He's a man who's radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in this situation".
Babbel obviously missed it.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, sports president Horst Heldt warns
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, neither players nor managers want to overestimate a win against a weakened, overwhelmingly overwhelming defensive line of the Romanian host.
They would have won in Glasgow before the awful wake-up after a 0-4 defeat at Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sports president Horst Heldt reminded us that while one goal has been achieved in the season, the other is still far away.
We're not over yet.
Heldt's failure to celebrate his 40th birthday after his first home win in three months was due to the weekend's events that they had just experienced in a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the game began.
There are decisions that are driven by others, not Jens, Heldt responded to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He was blaming the board for a weak management and decided to change coach after being pressured by puberty fans.
Even his day off after the games was canceled, Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmann's statements "formulate pure selfishness", Heldt replied, announcing the consequences for the goalkeepers.
Both forty-somethings will probably never have the joy of life again.
They agree with the others that without the work of a disbanded coaching staff, a performance as strong and combatable as this would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share in success", say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the ice pack agrees.
World heavyweight championship
A passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of world champion Vitali Klink.
However, after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his WBC heavyweight title.
The arbitrators' ruling was unanimous.
Vitaly Klitschko remains the heavyweight boxing world champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson by a unanimous score of 120:108, 120:108, 119:109 on Saturday night in Bern.
For Klick, this is his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was a two-time WBO and WBC world champion.
Unfortunately, it didn't come as everyone expected.
Klickko improved his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice being beaten by injury.
Challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th battle.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in Bern's arena, the 2.02 meter tall Clipper was fighting primarily with his left hand.
Eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced the end of the Klick's era before the duel, but withdrew from the World Champion's strike, so Klick could not strike decisively with his dangerous right-hander.
All in all, passive Johnson did little on the challenger and just tried to get into the next round.
The bell was provoked by words and gestures, but his strikes rarely hit the world champion.
But he's only the second boxer since Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought the Clock full 12 rounds.
The challenger had organized a riot in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klick as a "resistant zombie" who "doesn't do anything right".
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion was provoked, pulling his sunglasses out of Johnson's nose "so he could see his eyes".
Fourth win since Klick's return
The club remained undefeated after their fourth fight after their return on October 11, 2008.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and regained his "wBC" belt, which he had previously surrendered without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreol of the USA in September.
In this fight, I only got one hit and I was physically in good shape, justifying the call to a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF.
But the WBA belt is on Brit David Haye after he unseated the 6-foot-tall Nikolaev in November.
Haye cancelled the fight against the Crick this summer, which was scheduled for September.
His promotional company is reportedly planning a fight against the Crick at London's Wembley Stadium.
The case of Kunduz
Opposition frontal attack: Green faction leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of the misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left call on the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings of the Kunduz raid, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) committed a deliberate deception.
The minister said "consciously of the injustice" of the deadly bombing of two cisterns in September, said the head of the Green Faction, Jürgen Trittin, on the ARD news programme Tagesschau on Saturday.
Let's call it the usual expression: lying.
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That's the essence of the NATO report that Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks but also about targeting two Taliban leaders.
According to a NATO investigation, 142 people were killed or wounded in the US raid, which was ordered by German commander Colonel Klein.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left called on the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak out immediately before the Federal Council and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Parliament - and whether the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved the new strategy, called on Jürgen Trittin and her Green Party colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm has decidedly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also some doubts about the Ministry's statement on the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL's information, both Guttenberg and the other two were correct and fully informed of the background of the tanker attack.
It officially stated that they were to deny the existence of NATO reports and silence the minister on sensitive details.
But the two top officials said they even alerted the Department of Defense to several reports, including a two-page document from Commander Colonel Klein and a military police report.
The Frankfurt Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reports that Wichert was to request clarification in a letter.
It is recorded that he has not received any response so far.
The Ministry did not comment on the comments on Saturday, indicating that this will be addressed in the Federal Parliament's investigative committee to be set up next Wednesday.
The worlds of dreams
Some people see images in a wakeful state and hear voices that others cannot see or hear.
Not only the mentally ill or drug addicted, the boundaries between imagination and reality blend.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we can surround ourselves with the wildest fantasies and delusions of fantasy.
But those who experience a dream state while awake, see and hear things that others do not see and hear, are often viewed as crazy or drug addicted, or at least as weird, in today's Western world.
However, such images and voices do not just occur in people with mental illness or in those who are addicted to drugs.
The fault is our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, here and there, they make sure that the boundaries between dream, imagination and reality blend.
Dreams of altered states of consciousness can take many forms, at best we call them visions, at worst misguided.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the shamanistic states of insanity, psychosis, and hallucination can be inferred from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of neuronal brain transmitters - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is disturbed and the interactions between different parts of the brain are disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions are very common in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The connection between delusion and dream has been a concern of philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucination as a form of waking sleep. Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 that "the great similarity of hallucination to dream states" was that for Sigmund Freud, dreaming was even "psychosis, with all the nonsense, delusions, delusions of the senses".
It's the fall of 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and creepy colored.
Gravity has no power over it, it's hovering over the ceiling of the room.
He feels kicked.
Behind him, winged, bloody red-faced, precious toothed, goddamn figures.
They chase him, kick him in with heavy, flaming shoes, throw him against the wall, feel pain all over his body.
There are loud, bad voices coming from the walls and the radio.
He can't stand the voices that insult and insult him anymore.
Henning T. pulls two wires out of the stereo, locks them into a loop and fixes them to a hook on the ceiling.
He's gonna get on one speaker and put a loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The puppy will.
Learn, the voices of the choir, ripping his drums, "Go to the clinic and get treated!"
Henning T. is 40 years old today, has had six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
They were running LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, and he's also manic-depressive, taking medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubt, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people develop schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime, and in psychiatric clinics, it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenia, the affected person can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer world, and they get into a state of over-reaction that can lead to hallucinations, magnitude, relationship illusions, or the illusion of persecution.
Specifically, voices are heard - voices that command, comment, or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person is unable to distinguish between important and unimportant, the brain cannot filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis has opened up a flood of thoughts and fantasies that originate from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-focused, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic at the University of Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, it becomes passive, like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot actively shape them.
As a result, schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is often impossible, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is ruled out.
Once in a lifetime, you have to experience hallucinations.
Other than in a dream, says Fuchss, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that one perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved".
Misguided thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienating the experience takes place within the real world.
Scientists are still puzzled as to why our brains make such changes.
"Exceptional states can cause anyone to lose touch with reality in the short term", says Fuchs.
But not everyone develops into a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists assume that people with disabilities have minimal brain damage.
We believe that early developmental damage to the brain's neural maturity will occur, for example, with viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how the neuronal system disorder will occur, which has not been revealed for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger psychosis, if available.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains are jammed
It is insane that psychotronic people suffer from hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they take expensive drugs, others pay for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he interpreted his findings in his book Die irreale Welt in unser Kopf.
Hallucinations are not only a typical side effect of psychosis, but also a surprisingly large number of other disorders.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depression, illnesses such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma are also common.
Under certain conditions, it can also hallucinate the brain of a healthy person.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain that process sensory perception are too active or under-pressured; when our brain is stuck; or when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worry about love or other extraordinary states.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Meklenburg-Premier Pomerania and attends the local high school.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If it wasn't for the pictures and the voices.
At breaks, she may be called a long-haired, dark-haired, round-eyed woman.
When she answers, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one but her can see or hear this boy.
This shy girl is considered a sleepy dream, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, she knows it.
She's up, she's hearing and seeing the boy, just like she's hearing and seeing a girl sitting next to her in a bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling. She likes the boy.
Am I crazy? He asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and the other delusions are not real and he'll disappear again.
At night, the phenomena are more disturbing.
Frequently, delusions are a burden.
When she is in class, she cannot watch the classroom because the teacher is presenting her new classmate in her eyes and ears, while he explains the mathematical equation audibly and visibly to everyone else on the table.
At night, the phenomena are more disheartening.
When waiting in his dark room for sleep, which rarely comes and is too late, he often cannot tell whether he is awake or asleep, whether the images he sees, the grimaces, or the girl with bleeding sores on her hands and feet, are emerging before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she's yelling at the characters.
She won't tell her parents or friends, they'd think she's crazy.
Fall of 2009, Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted psychologist Kasten online, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Deception is also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or is deprived of stimulus, they are more likely to have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I guess the brain doesn't have enough work to do, and it's taking care of its own fun.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she's been calling her dad since childhood is not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same brain regions that process real sensations and sounds, it is difficult for people with disabilities like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusion and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "is in the brain, and reality is also displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they are so real".
Nightmares are also evaluated by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to consider hallucinations as extraordinary.
The boundary between sleep and hallucination
In our world of too much consciousness, the imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a painful, painful disease, but it also brings positivity, creativity -- delusion is also the art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called one-spirited form of experience, a special form of consciousness transformed into a dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the person concerned considers to be real and cannot even distinguish them back from a waking state.
Oneiroid states of consciousness occur in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as polyradicular inflammation patients who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, for example, by a persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline between sleep and hallucination.
Because in reality, it's impossible to handle a situation, worlds change, but the real situation is presented in the imagination.
An intense form of sensory support and sensory transfer in some unbearable situation that allows people to transform their own capacity to a momentary loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also, art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his one-sided experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (A Heart Changed) as a saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when he underwent a heart valve operation and a heart transplant, and his consciousness went on a journey of several days, with his body lying motionless in the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunged into the world he had created, visited strange times and places: becoming an old man trapped in a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot watching his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among a nobility who makes drugs from blood.
He's taken by a Greek to his homeland on a motorcycle, surfing in a hospital bed at a business in the Alps, meeting a Korean mobster.
It's all about the imaginary, the real thing, even later in the memory.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Clausen from any dream.
A dream is a different state, describing its experience.
Unlike dreams, memories of those mental journeys are still clear years later, in trivial details.
Even brighter and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show the uniroid states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug addiction, how fragile our inner images of outer reality are even in a state of wakefulness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality".
A fact that can also be enriching.
The snow may come
The burdock
At 27 , children are to take over the publishing house .
The new head of publishing Kallen is a transitional solution: In the long run, Hubert Burda wants to hand his business over to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding is to remain 100% family owned for the foreseeable future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for the long term.
Both children will inherit at age 27 and have a strong will to join the business, says the 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
We've been working on the details.
The question of whether they're active in the company is then.
And the question of whether they have the ability to do that.
You can't put your children in the lead of the 7,500 employees if they're not capable enough.
That would kill the kids and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would step down as Chairman of the Board as of January and appointed his successor, Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the board of Burdy since 1999.
He was in charge of technology first.
Later, with the Treasury, responsibility for the company's assets was added and, following the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, Direct Marketing, Cizina, Print and Finance.
For the first time, no family member is running the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17, and his son Felix, who would have been 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Callen's naming is also used to "cross 10, 15 years", Burda said.
The holding should remain 100% family owned in the future, Burda says.
In the context of the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda stated that even family businesses are not guaranteed to go bankrupt: 'It has always been the case with companies that have been infected with the desire for capital, that have been speculating and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power", Burda says.
I don't feel like a political preceptor of this country like Springer did, and I don't want to play World League with Time, these deals are too big.
Complete beauty care
Everything you can wish for in beauty and well-being is within your reach.
This was the intention of El Corte Inglés, which has just started operating the Callao shopping centre (Madrid) covering an area of more than 1000 m2 and providing a wide range of body care services.
The wellness department is located on the eighth floor, where prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which deals with laser hair- Spaxión, spaces for relaxation and aesthetic procedures, Luis & Tachi peluqueros, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane offering natural cosmetics, and others are located.
There is also a food service and mainly a tea shop offering over 130 different types of tea.
You can relax with your partner and enjoy the view of the capital, rent a relaxation area for two hours and have your own beauty party with up to eight friends, relax in the hot tub, get a massage and a glass of champagne, which are some of Spaxion's options.
It is a total of 250 m2 in the form of 12 salons, which provide the above services as well as state-of-the-art facial, body care procedures and hydrotherapy.
For example, we can use the cavitation used to fight cellulite, or the vibration platform.
The rehab centre is also equipped with these machines, in addition to virtual trainers, which monitor individual client activities and thus provide fully individual care.
It all starts by inserting a personal key into the contact display that's located opposite the machine.
You can then watch the videos showing you how to properly perform our exercise set.
Your instructor guarantees that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) is enough to train all the muscles.
And if you want to go hairdressing after exercise, Luis & Tachi has a space where you can perform individual hair restoration procedures, enhancing your gloss and nutrition.
Innovation and exceptionalism are the ultimate goal of this city wellness centre, which is open daily from 10am to 10pm.
Other, of a kind used for the manufacture of goods
Christmas is coming, and it's a good time to find out what celebrities wear and adapt your wedding dress.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the character, which must be kept in mind.
We'll make a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric vehicle
Endesa Energy together with the Barcelona City Hall have set up the 'Office LIVE'.
This is a project to develop and promote an electric car in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE Office (Logistics for the introduction of electric vehicles) will establish and manage a roadmap for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will ensure mobility agreements, draw up, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVEL project, promote electric cars, collect opinions and findings on the activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this transport of the future.
3 'electricity cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project to introduce electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will also join the project.
These are three cities that the government has chosen under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric vehicles.
Endesa Energy has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan autonomous region.
This includes energy-related activities and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa in promoting electric vehicles.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively implements a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'quiet period' for the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is facing a "quiet period".
In the Economic Report of the Prime Minister for 2009, Zapatero summarised the measures implemented during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competition Plan for the automotive industry, we would be in a state of abandonment today, with the closure of some of our main manufacturing plants", the Prime Minister said.
'Thanks to this plan and the wish of the individual brands to continue operating in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a period of calm is envisaged for the industry, which is our main export sector, in the future.'
In this respect, it underlined that the Competition Plan, which forms part of the Integrated Automotive Industry Plan (IAP), allocated 800 million for projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiaries which mobilised investments in excess of EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that the investment is intended to develop new models, to modernise production and to modernise existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's support measures for the requirement and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is implemented in cooperation with the autonomous regions and carmakers.
According to the President, this plan has allowed to reduce the average emission level of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6% and ensured a "significant increase" in registrations, namely by "40%" in November.
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first International Classic Vehicle Show will open in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the motoring world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It will have an exhibition area of 20 000 square metres and will be attended by more than 200 exhibitors from both the country and abroad.
Not only will you find classic motorcycles and cars here, but ClassicAuto Madrid will also have products of all kinds related to the world of motors.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of classic engine products, real collector's and curious delicacies.
The following companies will be involved:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renovation; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renovation; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialist Mercedes Benz company.
External competence tests
In addition, the commercial activities of the salon will be complemented by parallel activities: concentration events, sporting events, competitive exams, presentations and competitions.
Eligibility tests for classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on an adapted circuit outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: keeping the sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative impact on sporting style.
And that's why Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start system - also called a stop - which is a device that is currently only available with a 2.0 150 hp petrol engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is characterised by the good characteristics it has achieved as a whole.
Surface management, vehicle performance, population, behaviour, mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are excellent for the Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver's seat, have excellent ergonomics and are well-mounted.
The steering wheel is also extremely fine.
Using the toolkit and console set, we can conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend of developing futuristic design with many buttons and controllers and distinctive red and blue colors.
This style is partly reminiscent of the style that Honda Civic also presents.
So we can say that the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product is more than enough room for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, the large luggage compartment and regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic stop and start system is currently only available with a 2-litre petrol engine and 150 horsepower six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real treat, very delicate, with a reduced noise level, performance and lower consumption.
Although the most popular Mazda3 is a diesel version, those who do not drive as many miles a year should not rule out the gasoline-powered i-Stop, which is characterized by greater ride comfort and reduced consumption.
As regards equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
For serial equipment, the main features of the RVM are the blind-angle tracking system, the torque and stability control, the speed control, the internal light-sensitive mirror, the large-screen on-board computer, the parking sensors, the air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, Bluetooth and Bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped with the Pack Premium, for an additional fee of EUR 1,500: adaptive two-phase lights and a BOSE audio system with a CD holder, among other components.
The conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its class.
It is characterised primarily by the quality of the materials used, its operation and the high level of equipment.
And people who don't drive more miles a year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is only 2.0-cylinder and 150 horsepower.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is EUR 21,770 for the Luxury and EUR 23,270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a great dose of satisfaction for every day.
The Luxury 'Premier'
L.A. has a red carpet, as soft as the hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars were shining more than ever in the new elegant and sexy Nine models.
Our Pe, extravagant as usual, chose the dark ladies.
The Pledge of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is only used to view mail, without the ability to view any type of attachment or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named him one of its products of the year.
It's harder to see him out there, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is very low priced and has monthly payments, less than half the amount paid for, say, an iPhone's data plan.
Following its success, the company began offering two new devices: one dedicated exclusively to Twitter, the other based on a continuously provided free data service, for which Peek would have to pay a sixfold fee.
FonPeek, which was unveiled yesterday at Le Web, is the European version of the invention and its third iteration.
It's limited like its American counterpart, but it does come as a surprise.
The monthly maintenance fee is around EUR 12 per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People who travel with a smartphone already know what it's like to lose data services after crossing borders or to look impatiently for a WiFi cafe (or Fon) to view their mail.
The idea of fixed-price rooming is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, you would need a PhD in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to read the miniature letters.
The European Commission has consistently demanded that roaming tariffs be reduced to be accessible to the whole of Europe, which still has no effect.
There is a reasonable concern about using data services outside the home country.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (which is interesting to note that it still has the Fon name when it does not have WiFi) will reach this type of tariff means that operators are beginning to think differently and are considering different offers to compensate their data networks.
Kindle is another good example, offering book downloads and other Internet searches.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is valid at the time of purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen one day in the case of FonPeek, it's a permanent access purchase option like the one Peek has already introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect that because I think it's the best type from a consumer's point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in a computer.
The color Michelle adores
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama's inauguration as President of the United States, she chose the same colored dress and coat as she wore it to the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with glowing effects - in both cases it was a three-piece suit - a dress, a bag and a coat made of the same fabric - decorated with a large seam or a glue.
At first glance, it seemed that the First Lady of the United States had decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The material of clothing makes the two models very different.
Michelle used a large pencil to make her debut in Oslo.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with a medium-high sole, a model similar to the current one, but in gold.
She's wearing different hairstyles, this time with a hairstyle that's been dissolved.
75% of working mothers have work-related problems.
Employment discrimination has increased in recent years, particularly among younger women who are planning to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and working career of Spanish women', carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market due to motherhood.
The study highlights that there are many differences in views on the number of children at the beginning of a partnership, depending on whether they work or not, and also depending on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job start living with their partner earlier, have their first child earlier and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, particularly in the public sector, partnership and motherhood are postponing and have fewer offspring.
'Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years after the start of their partnership.This figure is 4.1 for women who have spent most of their lives in stable employment and have therefore had to postpone their partnership and the birth of children.
The type of occupation also has a strong influence on motherhood, although less on the time of the start of life with the partner", explains Margarita Delgado, a CSIC researcher.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and the birth of of offspring is their education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which women marry and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49 years, women with primary and higher education had their first child at 25.1 or 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their education.
Women with basic education marry and have their first child before they can find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education who go on to the opposite end prefer to get a stable job before they marry and have their first child", says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the face of various products of the brand under the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it'.
The 'Joyeux Noël' host, one of the most elegant actresses internationally, joins other famous L'Oréal Paris figures such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanishwoman Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the actresses Evangeline Lilly and Freida Pinto joined this select club.
The men's side of the cosmetics brand is also represented by prominent figures: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'The Lost').
Prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most prominent representatives - designers and models, past and present - gathered for the annual awards ceremony in London at the Royal Court Os Justice.
No one missed the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted Model of the Year.
The poker of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vicent donates in "Es poker" (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente) thirty X-rays of writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases in everyday life).
He does not do so in the fearsome and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but he seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement, and Vicent doesn't spare the trouble or the inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader's pleasure, even when read over and over.
I'll make a few observations here.
About Albert Camus: "I found in the pages of this book that the Mediterranean is not a sea but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, similar to what I feel, but not to be called: the enjoyment of misfortune, the morality without guilt, and the innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "The nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote by his own nature and not his own intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with a blinding poetic humor, meaningless, as if it were the blade of a knife that nearly killed him".
About Graham Green: "Our man has been entrusted with the passion of this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and regret, which is a spiritual privilege to reach heaven by way of damnation".
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey, published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, is one of the eight-thousand peaks in universal literature to be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall".
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He said he was the heir to the landlord from the county, and he said he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, they were big dreams".
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer recorded on the bridge the mad cry of this man of Munich to take his voice into the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running before himself and calling into the future and speaking loudly to the worms".
Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed, 'My dear God, please stop me from writing like a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the words of Spenser: 'After effort comes sleep, after storm a quiet harbor, after war rest, after a full life death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his luggage.
Her husband agreed with her saying that Edward VII was watching her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never before has a man been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness".
About Pío Baroya: "What else did Martin Santos want to do but focus Joyce on Baroya?
What else did Benet want to do than have Barrow executed with a Faulkner gun?
What else did Cel want but to make himself famous at the expense of that man's fame?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada County, and a group of young people, ages 15 to 18, passed by and our dog, a crusader rescued from the shelter weighing up to six kilograms, was kicked twice without a word and badly injured.
Our outrage is all the more that we see nothing funny in such aggression against a small, defenseless animal that was on the lead.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on a walk, she began to worry about her own safety, because such a demon-possessed man who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, child, old man, or anyone weaker than himself.
It happened at 5:00 p.m. on a Tuesday in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
We have, of course, complained to the nearest commission, but we doubt it was for anything, and to avoid raising sensitive questions, we conclude that these cowardly killers were of Spanish nationality.
Anger has caused us to announce this fact.
We don't understand what happens to today's youth when they enjoy being tormented by a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We don't understand where proper manners, respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for using helmets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially for younger drivers, as both bodies have informed today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only means of preventing head injury and death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin states that this campaign is part of its road safety commitments, which 'means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products', and confirms that it is also seeking to achieve this purpose through an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of motorcycle helmets, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase in which signs will be placed on more than 500 motorcycle repairers to reach the general public.
In conclusion, Michelin pointed out that road safety is 'a constant problem' for the company, which is a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheelers and whose main objective is to continuously improve product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles increase
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represented an increase of 12,6% compared to 2008 and, moreover, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to figures from the Anfac Manufacturers' and Ganvam Sellers' Patronal Organisation.
However, a favourable figure is better to quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and represents a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, regardless of the increase in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles in the light commercial vehicle category: passenger car derivatives, pickup trucks, delivery trucks, small trucks and light trucks/trucks.
And the clouds that most damage demand have not disappeared, even though they were bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by small and medium-sized companies, and 100% of the time, they are financed through third parties.
The restrictions resulting from the closure of the bank's credit source should be supplemented by other factors such as a halt in activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the support for the purchase of 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention persons who are subscribers to small and medium-sized enterprises who intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3,5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per km, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, the Ganuam authorities again reminded that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles and also to the management of industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Dealers expects that the 2010 trend will be similar to last year and that, according to the calculations, sales of passenger cars and 4x4s will decline by 19%.
The manual brake support system is now mandatory.
As with the ABS anti-lock system, ESP stability management and handbrake support systems will be compulsory equipment for European cars.
In fact, it already forms part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others a deadline for removing the shortfall is set, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase pedestrian protection, while working in a way that can help prevent many falls.
The manual brake support system increases the brake pressure in an emergency, which the system will detect after the driver has stepped down.
But he can't always keep up the pressure.
According to a study by Bosch, a car manufacturer, one third of the drivers who have an accident did not step on the brake before the crash and half of them did not use the brake force to their full potential.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the braking system to maximize, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU alone, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 pedestrian-related fatalities per year could be avoided.
The reduction in this number will be even more significant - according to the calculations, one in four accidents with a human impact would be prevented - after the introduction of so-called smart hand braking systems.
In this case, the vehicle shall be equipped with a system which (with the help of radar or cameras) detects and reports obstacles to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help to increase the pedal pressure if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the equipment shall apply the braking force as minimally as possible and minimize the risk of damage.
General Motors is postponing plans for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas, Zaragoza, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably on 8 April - as Javier Ortega informed the American manufacturer, the renewal plan for Opel will take longer.
Nick Reilly, new president of GM Europe, is trying to get every point of the plan agreed upon first with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will be submitted first to the employees and then to the governments of the countries where the plants are located, may be issued later than the beginning of 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken within these days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US producer to make certain decisions as soon as possible.
GM is making contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also wants to acquire Volvo but is considering the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian Converg group.
If none of these can be agreed, GM could sell some of the Saab assets to Baic in China.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year remains valid if its sale is not successful.
Driving with the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this luxury model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, thus showing only 1.275 kg.
The first was the automatic retractable roof with a hand-held canvas, reducing the weight by 21 kg; the aluminium door was also used, such as the GT3, which means an additional 15 kg less; the air conditioning was removed; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 litres to 54 litres also contributed to an additional 7 kg less weight; the additional 12 kg were added to the sports seats, thanks to the lighter 19 inch wheels, which added another 5 kg.
And finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacing the door sleeves with textile sleeves means another kilogram.
Also offered with a dual-clutch PDK transmission, one vehicle with a hand-held six-speed gearbox was tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain slopes with many intricate turns.
His behavior can only be classified as untouchable.
Weight loss does not mean that the vehicle does not press on the asphalt.
Rather, it's the opposite: it's been a long time since we've tested a model so small and light that it can deliver such safety at a corner, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete who can warm up his muscles on a short drive for as long as it takes until we give him a sprint, brake, and reboot...
Anything we want, with the controls being as communicative as they are precise, anything we point to with our hands on the wheel, that's what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The 320-horsepower V6 boxer is a very powerful sound, and can be enhanced by the 'sport' option and by a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether sucking or recovering.
The curls are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road pavement we're driving with the Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car did manage the exits well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and at some turns we came across a freezer and a slide, even in the early morning.
Definitely this ultra-light car is one of the most entertaining on the market, as it's more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be offered for sale in February 2010 for a price of EUR70,831.
'Bag Girl'
A friend of Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Coco Cocoon series and an occasional starlet at company shows, the singer is showing off her face as vehemently as her Chanel bags.
More than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", it's "Bag Girl".
Baskonia won a victory in Israel
The workhouse won a brilliant 82-91 victory in their hosted match at the complicated Maccabi Electra, despite numerous absences from Dusk Ivanovic, and thus came to the top of their group after a great performance by Mirza Teletovic, who was declared the best in the team with eight triple points (29 reviews).
The Victoria Society was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mick with a large dose of commitment and collective effort, although it had to suffer to the end to win.
In addition, the high accuracy of the 16-triple-point circuit played a big part in the final triumph.
The match started in front of the blue, who had been fighting for the mark from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets for Victoria were from a distance already indicated that they attacked the Israeli squad very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the 18-20 shooters at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alawite team opted for Barac's internal play and the work of Elijah, who was greeted with a whistle and applause on his return to his original position to increase the advantage before the break began (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to show his best performance in the group with 13 points, although 'no six' in Splitter's rating already suggested that it would not be the best night for the Brazilian.
But even though the match was fierce until the break, it was not decided in the slightest and the Macauese wanted to remind Victoria that not everyone wins on their pitch, and 'the hands of Elijah' managed to win.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to the return of the "yellow" to the glory (50-49).
More unsuitable
Ivanovic's members, injured but not dead at all, needed several precise games to catch their breath, and that was when the Mirza Teletovic rifle appeared, which returned the score to a calming 54-67 with three almost consecutive tries and with the help of Englisch and Ribas, which the locals achieved at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaves have been scratching their skin in the final part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to deprive them of the results they deserve for the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this and the Splitter excluded Ivanovic from the FA Cup, they did not rush and defend well, and although the Israelis were approaching the final minute (80-85), the match was already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in a season.
The injuries make Unicaia unable to fight
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece to Olympiacos and left him in charge of Group B in Euroleague in a match marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all an in-game play (Freeland, Lima and Archibald) which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagy Society was not afraid of the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship or rivalry, perhaps one of the most sickly in Europe, and with a large budget.
The first quarter's game allowed the Andalusians to dream, and the offensive defense and three consecutive triple-points, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillaume Rubia, lit the field for a 12-18 minute.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local arsenal in the home game with Bourous, Vujcic and Schortsanitis turned the score 22-20, a minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the USABeverley and Williams opponents meant both players were eliminated.
The Greek team began to operate and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to Joel Freeland's injury and three personal mistakes by Carlos Jiménez made the Unicaja team more difficult.
Between the inside players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas with three points increased the lead to 44-32, 19 minutes.
Impossibility of retaliation
The third leg was very offensive by Olympiacos, who, despite losing 19 points, proved the advantage and even managed to close the gap to the match in Malaga 66-48, the 27th minute, which shook the lead in the group.
Unicaia were trying to overcome the absence and recent absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the odds, with the lead and triple points from Cook and Lewis, Unicaia left a certain hope for a 66-57 win, 31 minutes.
But it was practically impossible because Olympiacos, with its reinforcement and dominance in centimeters in its zone, proved itself unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to tie the basketball average 81-62, the 37th minute, and Unicaja took over and handed over the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you collect for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the pay they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, the search engine with the highest number of ranked real estate, employment and motor vehicle ads in Spain.
The How Much Should You Take? tool calculates users' salaries based on the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using the form available on Facebook, where to enter the profession, years of experience, age and the city where the candidate wishes to work.
Within a week of the app's launch, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally "feels underpaid", explained Albert Rivera, who is responsible for the product, in his report.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
The British programmer receives 45,226 gross euros a year and the French 31,059, while the Spanish receive 24,000.
Likewise, the driver has a net annual salary of €34,247 in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is a waiter with a net annual salary of €11,592; followed by a salesman with €14,725 and a worker with €15,667.
The most searched online jobs in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker.
Brazil has set a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has fixed the stay of Manuel Zelaya at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office shall leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, the date on which his term of office officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in Honduras' capital, confirmed to TV Globo that Mel knows he must leave the embassy where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27th, when his term ends, he must leave and seek another refuge".
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government", Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 election (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed because Zelaya refused the political asylum condition that the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti tried to impose on him.
Thank you .
After the days of wine and roses last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should come as no surprise, as it is already a natural state in an environment where players make decisions about a future that is itself uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise the market was to cash out debt by directly buying assets and to release liquidity at a close to zero rate indirectly so that financial institutions could buy assets at a discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have virtually ceased and, without challenging their uncoordinated liquidity policies, are starting to throw a little sand into the mud, as the Spanish central bank did with its auction last year.
Investors are therefore questioning the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are taking part in a return on reduced risk returns.
The market volatility and the bond differences between companies have again gained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal levels they had at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
Once again, the pressure is on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany have become the haven of choice for investors, widening the differentiation between euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was almost untouched by this instability, but by then Standard & Poor's had come and threatened a new revision of the Kingdom of Spain's qualification reduction.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty is not useless in silencing moral risk advocates who have tried again to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy by preventing the devastating consequences of restricting credit to employment, when in fact a new day of giving thanks should be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between the emirates to restore power in the emirates, and as for Greece, we have seen this before.
A government covering the deficit, elections, and a new government coming in.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barros.
It is not appropriate for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro country to default on its commitments.
The logic is that Ecofin should force the Greek government to be transparent and to hold its citizens accountable when emergency measures are needed to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the period of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some excess on the supported positions would be within the expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt gaps will increase, as will the bonds of European companies, we need not worry.
If the European gaps are reduced and ours are further expanded, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The importance of Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote, and when our leading indicators force most of our studio services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their recovery scenarios for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not offer much hope for the Spanish economy to survive this warning.
Again, it looks like this will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now, "be careful, fellow drivers".

President Ignacio Sánchez Galán, President of Iberdrola, first spoke yesterday before the House of Representatives Subcommittee, where he is discussing Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades.
Following his intervention, followed by a speech by Gas Natural-Fenos President Rafael Villasecy, Galán made several comments to the press on the proposal, which he submitted to the Subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest €50,000 million by 2020 and another €60,000 million from this date to 2030, if the nuclear power plants currently in operation are to be maintained.
If that doesn't happen, the investment needed will not be 60,000 million but up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola is indeed of the opinion that investment in the next decade must be directed not to increasing production capacity but to distribution networks and international connections
From 2020, the question will change and there will be a need to increase performance.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal-fired power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and in particular on renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW of new energy is needed, but with other 'supporting energies'.
Galán, who believes the proposed sustainable economy bill that the government has just approved is in line with the company's demands, refused to go live as a royal decree to promote national coal consumption that opposes climate change policies.
In his view, there is a "clear long-term stake" in this regard, despite the "clear" measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
In any event, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must start being made now because they are mature and a stable tax framework is needed to launch them.
Ferrovial won the 'handling' of Aer Lingus at ten airports
The Swiss-based Ferrovial airport ground services subsidiary Swissport will be the preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at the ten European airports where it operates.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet expired economic terms, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilian-La Mancha Union and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol on cooperation to create the Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation yesterday.
The association envisages an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will be held by Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to research energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona is working on its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first highway concession in Australia, a market where it already operates as an energy and water business.
The construction of the tunnel is estimated at A$1.700 million (about EUR1.047 million).
Its rivals are the French firm Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5-kilometer tunnel in the eastern coastal city of Brisbane, Australia, has become the closest way for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction and concession road company.
The mayor wants the tunnel completed by the end of 2014
After selecting the public-private partnership (PPP) for further development of the project in the business plan of Erns & Young, the administration has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the toll.
The tender is expected to be submitted in May and the expected investment will be A$1.700 million (€1.047 million) and three companies with a significant presence in European construction will compete in the final phase.
The group, Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground construction.
Against Acciona, Northern Direct is in the game, with British manager Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction company Bouygues.
The third and last group to cross the network is LBRJV, and it is owned by the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), as well as by the local Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and a major civil engineering firm Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction and privatisation, but it has a clear difficulty in entering by other means than through the acquisition of local construction companies.
The strategy pursued by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger remains an example for the Spanish giants in the sector, in addition to the Asian benchmarks.
ACS gained a market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton, cited above.
The amount of the assets
Acciona is based on the geographical area most relevant to the sector where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, he has the largest wind farm in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of companies that build and manage desalination plants in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
It now plans to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the construction and infrastructure areas.
The toll-free underground road, Northern Link, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Authority, is to connect the Western Toowong Highway with the 5 km long Kelvin Grove Circular Route (see map) tunnel.
The calendar established by the local authority plans to be commissioned by summer 2010 and to start work by December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, full completion of the works is not planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to fund it.
Brisbane has already offered the contract to Hochtief
Australia is still making a significant profit for Hochtief, having announced a deal with the government yesterday estimated at 154 million.
ACS shares will operate the national broadband network infrastructure with fibre optic cable through its local branch in Leighton.
This situation will allow 400,000 people to access the Internet quickly and provide a German company with 18 months' work.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the 27-story King George Tower project in Brisbane, Australia, and construction work was just beginning, with Hochtief closing the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will be involved with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
The FCC has been allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC obtained, through its Alpine subsidiary, an allocation of EUR 64,5 million for the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 kilometres for the motorway in Slovenia.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after the tunnel extension in Bosruck, Austria, was completed for 130 million euros.
In this way Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of work is planned for early 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got a commercial in Renfe.
Renfe has been assigning advertising and marketing services to Mrs. Rushmore's agency for the past two years for an estimated three million euros a year, the railway company said.
The contract includes an option to extend for 12 months each year. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that entered Renfe's competition, four of which advanced to the final, including TBWA, which has been responsible for creating the commercials for the past three years.
From this point on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaign.
Fines of 63 million for France Télécom for the suspension of competition
The French competition authority has fined France Télécom EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to the institution, the operator restricted the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes with consumers on the margins of regulation.
The former French monopoly and still state-owned company has been fined more than EUR 560 million since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was increased de facto because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed a similar offence in the past and that there has therefore been a recurrence.
Application business
On the other hand, the French company's mobile branch is still a star among other operators and has opened an online app store to increase revenues that will not come from voice broadcasting.
From the outset, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 to enter other countries like Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought in 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its inception
The Champions League has been a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since earned 476.4 million, making them the third and fifth highest-earning clubs in the competition.
The charter is run by Manchester United.
The charter is run by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a source of fame, it's also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition has distributed EUR 5,362.5 million among 105 associations (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in the event since the inception of the tournament in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have come out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third highest paid club on the continent, and the only one, along with AC Milan, to win the main prize three times.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the 1992 European Cup, is fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, the two teams that also earned the most money for last year's Champions League.
And that's despite both losing to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country to have won the most money through the Champions, despite having won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to raise €1.090 million for the Champions League.
UEFA has committed 413,1 million of this money to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs participating in the preliminary qualifying round (including Atlético Madrid) has received 2,1 million.
In addition, those who qualified received 3.8 million for their attendance alone, plus an additional 550,000 euros for each match they participated in.
There are also prize money for the winners (EUR 800,000) and the draw (EUR 400,000 for each team).
Each of the last four gets four million.
The champion earns $9 million, while the runner-up earns $5.2 million.
This way, the club will earn at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are also variable payments for which 337,8 million is allocated.
This money is allocated according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main languages and has four assigned places.
Last year's champion will receive 40% of the money allocated, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches played this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers € 61 million for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday published details of its offer to buy shares, which it wants to use to acquire a top position of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos's capital.
This percentage is not binding on the making of an offer to acquire (options) all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa is offering EUR 1,5025 per share, which it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest on this deferral of 1% per annum.
Sos shares closed trading yesterday at EUR 1,85; the Nueva Rumasa offer therefore valued the company at 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
Jerez Group gives 15 days to shareholders to notify their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV stated that it was not informed of the tender, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sauce continues to change the structure of its leadership.
In an attempt to stay on the brink of possible bids to buy and settle the legal fluctuations of its former leaders, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, the election of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in a food business.
This is a newly created position that will be directly subordinate to the group president.
And it's not out of the question, as the business is still in a legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than $230 million from Sos by the Salazar brothers.
The possibility that the Sos will reveal new fund movements in the coming months cannot be ruled out.
As regards the Salazar loan, former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified yesterday before the National Court and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
The CNMV authorises the option to exclude the Patternina that participated in Inversora Mer
The National Securities and Exchange Commission (CNMV) yesterday approved the exclusion of Inversor Mer against Federico Paternino on 9 October.
The Authority explained that it would authorise this operation because it understood that its conditions were in line with the applicable standards and considered that the explanatory leaflets submitted following the adjustments introduced on 2 December were 'sufficient'.
CNMV clarified that the tender is aimed at acquiring 550,008 shares of Federica Paternina at a price of EUR 7,65 per share, representing 8,95% of the company's capital, which consists of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were divested, which cannot be transferred in any way until an offer has been made, specifying that the price was set by Federic Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New tools for the valuation of cars
These days, the storms and accidents are not just about car services.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance accident are towed to a service station where the expert has to estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and calculating parts costs and labour time can be long and complex work.
It may take two or three hours to calculate the repair costs by hand, from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and labour.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That's why almost 100% of experts use this kind of system.
Insurance event and maintenance assessment service and solution providers shall collect information provided by manufacturers to them in order to develop and offer a useful tool to their customers.
In Spain, Audatex, the US-based Solera Group, is the leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation and information processing tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, Audatex's commercial director, they work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers and each provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is continuing to grow as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
Once the new vehicle enters the market, these enterprises will start operating.
It's a very hard job because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the car and set the price.
In addition, each model is "smart" graphics processing, where individual parts of the tourist cars can be "pinched".
As for the mass-selling model, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
For minor cars, it can take three to four months. Audatex currently has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they know about are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In the case of the parking lot, traffic is above 99%.
For the purpose of documentation and database processing, Audatex has eight centres spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) each specialising in a specific brand.
The national office is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work with three computer screens at the same time.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are sorted and customers are updated every two days.
The processing of this huge stream of information allows businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common use is for repairs and maintenance, but country-by-country tools also exist to manage spare parts or to calculate the sales or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide to report the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but they do in the United States.
With the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to obtain support for professionals in the sector.
The company offers ten different tools, with AudaPlus, the standard insurance event valuation solution for experts, being its star product.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the painting company.
This tool shall be applied according to the use for each assessment.
The maximum price is EUR 5,75 for customers who use it less, up to 10 times a month.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates their price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the full identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open online service for the professional sector that allows you to discard vehicles with an overall insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for trend identification, geodemographic analysis or for finding deviations by brand or model.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of certain brands have been serviced due to accidents or how many have suffered serious insurance incidents over a period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of instrument.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official manufacturer's hours.
Gt Motive is an Einsa Group company founded in 1971 as a supplier of damage, accident or maintenance services and solutions to automobiles
The Gt Guía valuation is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 service users, 3,100 professionals and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover has increased by 20% per annum over the last three years and in 2008 accounted for EUR 10,8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of the Paris office installation began.
Audatex was established in Germany in 1966 and in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its brother is in Europe and 38% in North and South America, and it operates 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global invoicing of Soler (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, an increase of 3,3% over 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera was listed at $1,000 million and its shares are now estimated to be worth a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
In October last year, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special-purpose vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation envisaged a subscription of EUR 59,5 million from 85% of the company's capital, which could be expanded by the remaining 15% next year.
The purchase was aimed at providing more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This pricing and buying and selling service is exclusively for professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, lenders, servicers, sales of spare parts and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
The platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages over 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
The main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The Web currently has over 1,500 registered dealers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been discarded cannot be returned to service but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be allowed to operate, even if they have been disposed of, after a preliminary examination.
The four-step service budget
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives the budget in only four steps: vehicle identification, search for replacement parts, budgeting, budgeting.
The ease of use is a key condition for these systems, in particular for convincing older professionals who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, of which 666 tourist, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, you need a computer with an internet connection to use it.
After identifying the model to be repaired, a real graphical representation of the model shall be displayed using the chassis number and the required spare parts shall be selected.
The user may include variables such as labour price, surcharge or discount, and then print and pass them on to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include a workforce estimate.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year which can be financed by the customer.
Audatex is currently working on making this display three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, because it allows you to, for example, pick a door and turn it around to show the inside.
