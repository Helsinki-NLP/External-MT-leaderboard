Japan has about 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands located near Japan, Japan is geographically referred to as a "island group".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which initiated a change in indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese laborers to work on their sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared the Qing Empire of Taiwan a province in 1885.
In 1895, after the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded Japanese sovereignty over Taiwan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the three window chambers.


For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size near the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
35 mm format actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide is 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Some common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are equal to or approximate to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds and often derogatory is a simple guideline for creating dynamics by keeping the order in an image.
This indicates that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
Throughout European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.

The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth has led many to question whether this doctrine of religion was ever fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting significant military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
UK mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire sea, posing a threat to neutral ships.
As there was limited response to this strategy, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.

After witnessing the horrors of war and atrocities during World War I, nations were eager to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Thomas Edison's Charles Bacheler (his manager at his previous job).

The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Cemetery" of Egypt's Dead Valley, includes several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the family members of Khufu's wives.
"Upper bow" marks V and "lower bow" marks a staple or a square with the lower part missing.
Up means you should start with the top and push the bow, and down means you should start with the bow (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
A lower-case tone is usually stronger and more pronounced.

To understand the Templar one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the order.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, which is the period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was the era before the Early Middle Ages and a later Late Middle Ages which traditionally ends around 1500.

The basic interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological development itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence at the larger level, and that technology has an "impact" on the societies involved rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the motor car inevitably improves the roads.

Romance was a major element of cultural fatalism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fitch, and Schlegel.


Its reputation as a major center of luxury began around 400 CE and lasted until around 1100 CE.

It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.



Sustainable farming is farming that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, predominantly organic system, using native seeds from conserved ecosystems for maximum yield, along with crop cycles or other relatively simple techniques.
Historically, most farms have been engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded people who feel themselves neglected by social norms and helps in the development of identity consciousness.

Subculture may be a combination of linguistic, aesthetic, ethical, political, sexual, geographic, or other factors.

One of the methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to draw attention to some of the unfortunate aspects of children such as neglect, misfortune, intentional abuse and not being socialized by adults in the midst of a child's development.
Some pet children have been confined by humans (usually their parents); in some cases such a child was abandoned by his or her parents because of a severe intellectual or physical disability.
Pets may experience severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or moved away from home.
others: "He was eaten by wild beasts", others: "He lived in the desert".
The behaviour of the animal puppy (within the physical limits) when brought in by a completely nonhuman animal is almost entirely a manifestation of animal behaviour such as its fear or indifference towards humans.

There is no method to learning scaffolds but there is a tool that helps a person who is learning something new such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words a teacher is a form of scaffolding, as is a small paperclick man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software and are used to question, indicate and understand processes that can be challenging to handle by students.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to forced recovery.

We consider the foster care system to be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster Care is expected to meet the needs that were lacking in the home they moved from.
Internet combines both mass communication and interpersonal communication.

For example, the use of the Internet has been called a significant driver for learning and socialization (James et al. 1995).

The use of video recording has paved the way for important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Especially is it claimed that one can correctly interpret subtle expressions to determine whether someone is lying.
Oliver Sacks in his paper The President's Speech suggested that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are able to assess truth.
He also suggested that such abilities could be used in animals such as domestic dogs to explain human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of this genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Isolation and recombination lead to alternate differences between the two poles with each generation.

The most readily available plant resources are leaves and berries, but for primates like us, it is hard to get enough of them until they are ripe.
In contrast, animal foods (chickpeas, ducks, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a high amount of protein containing essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
The process of waking up between the normal sleeping period and going back to sleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes) is called sleep interruption.

It was going to last for the next 40 years, and it was going to be fought, literally, by pseudo-armies from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and other war zones.

When the Soviet Union's 800,000-strong Red Army entered the war in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty and other international treaties, invading eastern Poland and forming the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, these plans were virtually obsolete overnight.

The role of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move people and goods, so that, at the same time, it interferes with your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
The most notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to bring troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
The German Navy was trying to block traffic there, primarily using U-boats.

The domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often with shepherds raising the goats as young or teenagers, similar to the more widely known shepherds. These methods of raising animals are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
Though the wagonway only included wooden parallel planks, it allowed the horses to gain more speed and to pull more weight than on some of the more rugged roads of the day.
The crosstige was introduced much earlier to hold tracks in place. Slowly, however, it was realized that the track would be more efficient if it had a piece of iron on top.
This became commonplace, but the iron wheels of the wooden wagons were more frictionless.
Eventually, the wooden wheel was replaced by the iron wheel. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.

His predecessor, Astralopithecus, did not usually walk upright.

Biological clocks are self-perpetuating devices that will continue free-cycle periods in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the major suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershé and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They used either DNA with radioactive phosphorus in the third phase or radioactive sulfur to mark the phase proteins.
Depending on the type of mutation, the mutation can have different effects, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to offspring, whereas elsewhere mutations can cause cell-death or cancer.

Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you would rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Transport systems generate these complaints, they fail on a daily basis? Is the transport engineer really incompetent? Or is something else going wrong?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of different drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Luckily, the driver behaves within reasonably consistent limits; thus, traffic flows have some reasonable stability and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship is established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to be brought into the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings back with their bodies.
This gives him a large chain of small places to hide from predators.

In general, two types of behavior can arise as a manager begins to lead his former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain one of the guys (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has difficulty in making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, fear is transformed into a stranger, who feels that he has to change everything he is doing and embrace himself.
After all, leadership is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often this behavior is the result of disagreements between the leadership and the rest of the team.

There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines can cover better distances.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are thirsty then bottled water is easy to get.
